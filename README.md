on a data set of your choosing.

### Data Science — Main program
#### Unit 1 – Data and Analysis
Concepts covered: Matplotlib, SQL, SQLite, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Seaborn,
Experimental design, A/B Testing
Project(s) you’ll build:
* SQL Challenge - Solve questions about AirBnB data using SQL queries with a database
that you'll set up locally.
* Data Cleaning & Validation - Practice data cleaning & validation using data from
WELLCOME Trust on open access publishing.
* Your First Research Proposal - Using a dataset of your own choice, create your first
Research Proposal (also known as an Experimentation RFC).
#### Unit 2 – Supervised Learning
Concepts covered: PCA, Feature engineering, Naive Bayes, Regression models, Classification
models, Least Squares Regression, Multivariable Regression, Class Imbalance
Project(s) you’ll build:
* Prepare a Dataset for Modeling - Using a dataset of your choice, you will explore
variables using univariate and bivariate methods.
* Build your Own Naive Bayes Classifier - Perform a sentiment analysis on feedback left
on a website to determine if it is positive or negative.
* Classifier Validation - Test the performance of your classifier from the previous project
and learn how to improve it.
* Your First Multivariate Linear Regression Model - Build a regression model using FBI
UCR Crime data in order to predict property crimes.
* Validating a Linear Regression - Validate your property crime model and based on the
results create a revised model. Test both old and new models on a new holdout or set of
folds.

#### Unit 3 – Deeper into Supervised Learning
Concepts covered: Similarity Models, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest, ID3 Algorithm,
Ensemble Modeling, Advanced Regression, Support Vector Machines, Boosting Models
Project(s) you’ll build:
* Model Comparison - Using your own chosen data set build a KNN and an OLS
regression and compare them.
* Random Forests & Decision Trees - Compare the relative accuracy of random forests
and decision trees using a data set of your choosing.
* Support Vector Machines Challenge - Translate a weak SVR into a more accurate SVC.
* Boosted Models - Give your model a boost in the Boosted Model Challenge.
Unit 4 - Unsupervised Learning
Concepts covered: Unsupervised learning, Basic Clustering, K - Means, Clustering Evaluation,
NLP (Natural Language Processing), Neural Networks, Deep Learning
Project(s) you’ll build:
* Supervised vs Unsupervised Drill - Determine whether a problem is best solved using
supervised or unsupervised techinques.
* Applying K Means - Use your knowledge of basic clustering to determine variance with
changes in K.
#### Unit 5 – Other Topics in Data Science
Concepts covered: Algorithms, Data Scraping, Big Data, Survey Design, Privacy and Data
Science
Project(s) you’ll build:
* Data Scraping - Learn the value of Data Scraping and practice on a source of your
choosing.
* Survey Design - Create a survey on the topic of your choosing and gather data from
users.
* Algorithms - Build your own algorithm for some of the models we’ve gone over so far!
