23,24,24: Random Show ,"   hello, ladies and gentlemen, this is tim ferriss, and welcome to another episode of the tim ferriss show  many of you have been asking for more informal conversations like the one that i recorded with kelly starrett and dr  justin majer over many, many bottles of wine, which you can listen to at your leisure, versus the more formal, i suppose, interviews that i ve done with people like cofounder and president of pixar, ed catmull  and you ve asked for it, and therefore, here it is  this is a high def audio recording of the random show  and the random show is effectively a catchup between two friends  and i am half of that conversation, and kevin rose, a dear buddy, is the other  he s a serial entrepreneur  he s built many different companies and products  he is a venture capitalist at google ventures  he s one of the best product guys in silicon valley, and very, very astute investor  but when we hang out and we do the random show, which is in video, so you will hear some references to visual things  and whenever you hear babe, by the way, that s in reference to kevin s wife, who is off camera, daria  you will hear some references to links and show notes and so on  all of those notes and links can be found at fourhourworkweek com podcast, all spelled out, fourhourworkweek com podcast  and to support the show, as always, just go to the time ferriss bookclub, and you can find books that have had a tremendous impact on my life  there are four or five of them up right now at fourhourworkweek com books  and without further ado, i would like to introduce you, if you ve never heard it before, to the random show  i hope you enjoy it, and thank you for listening   kevin rose   hello, friends, welcome to the random show  i am kevin rose   tim ferriss   i m tim ferriss   kevin rose   and this episode number, graham?  graham   i forget   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin rose   we don t know  but you know because it says it at the top of the youtube player   tim ferriss   mm, indeed   kevin rose   welcome! it s been a while   tim ferriss   it has been what, two to three months at least?  kevin rose   it s been at least three months   tim ferriss   at least  maybe four months   kevin rose   something like that  lots happened in those months   tim ferriss   a lot has happened   kevin rose   my drinking experiment, which we ll get to in a little bit  don t want to jump right into that one   tim ferriss   yeah, we can hold off on that   kevin rose   there s a good debate there  but i have a list of stuff to go over today  do you want to start first today? you ve got a good list   tim ferriss   sure  we can start with, perhaps, a caveat  so it turns out i found out just a few days ago that i m about 99 percent sure that i have lyme disease for the first time  so i grew up on long island  i go back every summer  and deer ticks carry the spirochete, it s a bacteria that cause the symptoms of lyme disease, which is really intense  i had dodged the bullet up to this point  everyone in my family has had it, as far as i know  and i started getting extremely swollen joints, to the point where it was painful to walk in the morning   kevin rose   you just woke up one morning?  tim ferriss   woke up one morning, knees were extremely swollen   kevin rose   had you discovered any ticks at that point or not?  tim ferriss   oh, i d pulled off four or five ticks  but every time i go home in the summer, that s the case  and i usually, or i shouldn t say usually, but a lot of people develop bulls eye circles, so expanding concentric circles around the bite, and then they go get it checked out because that s a symptom  i didn t have any of those rashes   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and i found out later that in a percentage of the people who get bitten and contract lyme, they don t show that  if you pull the tick off within the first, say, about   i think it s 16 to 24 hours of attaching to you, then you can typically prevent lyme  but my joints got so swollen, my elbows, my knees, so painful  my memory started being affecting   being affected, like formulating sentences and whatnot  so i might sound a little punch drunk in this episode  if you re wondering why, lyme disease  so i m on doxycycline and exploring a couple of other treatments for addressing it  but yeah, it s gnarly stuff, man  you gotta catch it early, or you can basically develop all the appearances of, say, cerebral palsy and things like that  kevin rose   that s crazy  but if you catch it early, i mean, you ll be fine   tim ferriss   should be fine  depends on who you ask  there s also    kevin rose   i ve heard sometimes that flare ups happen later in the future and things like that?  tim ferriss   that s what some   there are a lot of diverging opinions about lyme disease  and so some people talk about chronic lyme disease  some people think it exists  other people think it doesn t exist  there s a lot of debate  so if any of you out there are experts in lyme disease, if you have recommendations or thoughts, please let me know in the comments, because i will certainly be on meds by the time you see this   kevin rose   crazy  well, i hope you re gonna be okay  i mean, that s scary stuff  it is scary  i mean, and i always thought it was a very minor thing because eastern long island, as far as i know, has the highest density of deer ticks on the face of the planet  and you can t really go walking outside in grass that s more than a few inches long without getting ticks on you  then i started looking at the symptoms and the effects of lyme disease if you don t catch it, and it s really bad  it can be a really debilitating disease  so i m glad that i m doxycycline   tim ferriss   and now, so you take these antibiotics  i hate taking antibiotics, and i ll make a statement that might surprise some of you  i would rather take the scary anabolic steroids like testosterone or something like that than very strong antibiotics, because i feel like it s kind of yin and yang   well, they re very different, but my point being that people look at, say, misunderstood and oversensationalized drugs like anabolics, say, which are kind of copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    exaggerated to the point of like these reefer madness  kevin rose   like back in the  60s? yeah, like marijuana stuff like that   tim ferriss   exactly, like the  50s and  60s, where if you smoke a joint, you re gonna run through your house and hack off all of your relatives  heads   kevin rose   well, what was that movie you made me watch, bigger, faster, stronger, harder? whatever it s called?  tim ferriss   bigger, faster, stronger  the other ones, you can find at the castro on the street  but it was about all the myths about    kevin rose   yeah, performance enhancing drugs   tim ferriss   fantastic documentary you guys should all check out  but antibiotics are prescribed in a very nonchalant way   kevin rose   you get them all the time, no matter what you have   tim ferriss   and you just   the importance of the microbiome and your gut flora is so understated  i really try to avoid antibiotics  so i ll be sort of seeding my gut  and by the way, the answer is not necessarily probiotics  this is something not many people know  but i ll be doing a bunch more on this  so if you want a post about that, let me know  it takes a lot of time  if you re interested about how to properly seed your gut for optimal health, i m doing a bunch of research on that   kevin rose   speaking about seeding your gut for optimal health, this is actually a good segue   tim ferriss   okay   kevin rose   this is a really random way to start the show, but i guess it works  there is like this gut project  have you ever heard of the gut project?  tim ferriss   is it called the gut project?  kevin rose   it s something like that  it s gut project   do you know what i m talking about, babe? i ordered it in the mail  so basically, they send you   my doctor told me about it because i ve had mild to medium upset stomachs for a really long time   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   yeah, you ve had stomach issues for forever   kevin rose   and we were traveling to china  i m on pepto bismol nonstop  and it depends on what i m eating  i ve linked some of it to, sadly, beer consumption, and i think it might be tied to gluten in some way  but anyway, my doctor turned me on to this project that is like this completely nonprofit  and they give you all these little test tubes with little tiny q tips in it  and you send in   it s pretty discussing,    little samples of your shit  and then they will do the full on breakdown of all the bacteria   tim ferriss   so is it just fecal samples, or are you swiping your armpit and your mouth?  kevin rose   you can do anything, your armpit, wherever you want, and they will send you the full  but they compare it to people who are healthy people who have ibs, people who have all different types of stuff, and they give you the full on breakdown  you log in and it gives you all these stats about your bacteria versus other people s stomach bacteria   tim ferriss   are you sure it s nonprofit?  kevin rose   it might be for profit  i m not    tim ferriss   is it called ubiome?  kevin rose   no   tim ferriss   oh  there s a company called ubiome also doing something very similar  i actually have a bunch of kits at home   kevin rose   anyway, i ll put a link   i ll get a link in the comments  but you should check it out  it s not expensive, either  it s like 300 bucks   tim ferriss   no, i have a bunch of kits at home from, i guess, a competitor called ubiome   kevin rose   okay, cool   tim ferriss   which is based out here  but the whole point being, you are effectively   and we don t have to go too deep into this  but you are a collection of bacteria  i mean, there are more bacterial cells in your body than human cells  kind of hard to believe, right? and  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    people have attempted to eradicate bacteria, viewing them as germs and causes of disease, for ages, and approaching it in such a broad fashion is hugely deleterious to your health  and in fact, for those people out there, i don t remember the name of the article  you would like this too, daria  there s an article in, i think it was the new york times magazine about people who had not showered in weeks or even years  and instead of using soap, or i think it s laurel sulphate, other very strong detergents, they take ammonia eating bacteria and spray it onto their skin as a way of sort of cleaning themselves and maintaining optimal bacterial health on the skin, which is your largest organ  so not just in the gi tract, but on the skin  really good article that i m in the process of rereading because i m going to be doing a lot with the microbiome  and we ll link to that in the show notes as well  kevin rose   yeah, i want to check that out   tim ferriss   yeah, it s really, really   and also a very well written piece  it s pretty hilarious   kevin rose   that s awesome   tim ferriss   yeah, it s super, super fascinating stuff  and by the way, there are companies out there, big cosmetics companies that are patenting applications of, say, lactobacillus, which you find very commonly in probiotic supplements for topical applications  it doesn t really work  i mean, as far as i know, that s for ingestion and application in the gi tract  so where you apply a probiotic or prebiotic or anything like this makes a big, big difference  so don t believe the hype  anyway, so enough on that   kevin rose   well, one more quick point  speaking about my stupid stomach issues, i have been reading a book called grain brain  have you read it yet, or have you heard about it?  tim ferriss   i haven t  i m guessing there s grain brain, there s wheat belly   kevin rose   yeah  they re all in the same vein   tim ferriss   i d imagine they re pretty similar   kevin rose   yeah  so i mean, that s what got me to   actually, i didn t tell you this yet, but it s been about two weeks now i ve been gluten free   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   you just sent me a photograph today of your dog with a beer can balanced on his head   kevin rose   that wasn t my dog  it was a japanese    tim ferriss   ohh, it was a toaster doppelganger   kevin rose   it was a toaster doppelganger, yeah  it was a japanese dog i found on  inaudible    tim ferriss   ah, okay   kevin rose   but i actually just got some gluten free beer, some ipa  i haven t tried it yet, but i m going to do it after this wine  but anyway, what s interesting is that i think that i had some gluten a couple days ago, and i woke up the next morning being mentally foggy a little bit  and it describes some of that, what s happening here  anyway, it was just one particular   i m gonna go and try to do it for at least 60 days  they say until you really feel it is a couple months  so we ll see what happens   tim ferriss   we re gonna come back to this in a second  so if you re interested in this kind of stuff, there is an article written on my blog   i ll link to it   by rob wolfe, which i headlined  how to keep feces out of your bloodstream,  but it relates to grain consumption, leaky gut syndrome, and a host of other associated issues or factors   kevin rose   cool   tim ferriss   it s a very interesting read  if you re like, gluten free, gluten this   what the fuck is gluten actually? and nine out of ten people who are gluten free can t answer that   check out the blog post  so you re gonna go gluten free for 60 days   kevin rose   yeah  it s not that hard  it really isn t   tim ferriss   so now speaking of things that are hard, i hate to bring this up so early  i m curious to see what kind of debate you think this is gonna become  so you committed, last time we spoke, to go 30 days without alcohol   kevin rose   that s right   tim ferriss   and you failed to complete that 30 days  and the wager was  1000 to one s charity of choice   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin rose   we spoke on the phone before i actually threw in the towel  you remember that conversation   tim ferriss   i remember texting, and i still have the text thread  you re gonna try to pull something, kevin  you re challenging your spirit animal  do you remember what you said your spirit animal was?  kevin rose   the worm?  tim ferriss   the weasel   kevin rose   you said that   tim ferriss   i think you were drunk when you brought it up   kevin rose   you said that  you said that   tim ferriss   case in point   kevin rose   listen  here s the deal  i went through some really tough times  it had been three weeks of no drinking  and i m not saying i didn t break the rules  i did  i had a glass of wine and it was wonderful  a couple glasses of wine  but what i m saying is that i went through some tough times  we got protested in portland  people that don t know    tim ferriss   that s because you re raising historic    kevin rose   no, i m landmarked  okay, i m gonna take 30 seconds and explain this to the people that are watching this  basically what happened is my wife and i, we went up to portland, oregon  we fell in love with the town  it s a great city  i love the food scene, love that they have awesome cocktails out there  they ve got hiking trails, they ve got fishing, they ve got everything that i would like to eventually one day have a place as a little retreat   tim ferriss   notice the second thing you mentioned was excellent cocktails  continue   kevin rose   so we went up there  we found a place, and we found a place that we thought we were gonna remodel  it was an older place, older meaning over 100 years old  and ultimately, it turned out that the cost to remodel it was more or less on par with building something from scratch  so we  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    proceeded to move forward and have the house taken down and build something new  we went through that process  the neighbors found out about it  they freaked out  they had had the easter egg hunt in the yard of the house for the last 20 years  it was a very beloved house to the neighborhood  but it was not historically significant  we took several contractors through, walked through  and the thing about historical homes is you have to be able to point to something in the house, like oh, that s the crown molding, or oh, this banister is historic in some way  the only thing they ever came up with   nothing with the house, except we found out the house had asbestos  the only thing that they came up with was that there was a prominent attorney, portland attorney, that had lived there at one point many, many years ago  this guy doesn t even have a wikipedia page  he was big in portland at some point, that random attorney  we wanted to move forward and take the house down because it s old  and the neighborhood loved it, but it wasn t historic  tim ferriss   you had a tough couple weeks  i got it   kevin rose   they protested us  they put banners out there  there were people crying in the streets  it got    tim ferriss   what?  kevin rose   there was old people crying the streets, neighbors and stuff   tim ferriss   why are you so mean to old people?  kevin rose   at the end of the day, i m not an asshole, my wife s not an asshole  we sat there and we said   we threw our hands up and we said, you know what? it s time to abandon ship  and we sold the house back to one of the neighbors, and we went on, and now eventually, at some point, we d like to find another place  but i don t know when  but anyway, that was the story around that  so all this shit is going down  there s a freaking change org protest  i m getting emails from it, and people are calling the reporters  and i m not drinking during this time  and i m calling tim up and i m like,  tim, please, just one drink  it s been a long day   and you re like,  no, a deal s a deal, fucker  in the text   tim ferriss   i think that s fair   kevin rose   and you re like, you can break it if we can talk about it on the  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    show  and so my ask   tim ferriss   that s what we re doing right now   kevin rose      is that you give me pro rata for the time served of that month, and let me pay the remainder to you   tim ferriss   yeah  i ll give you 10x or nothing if you can go the next 30 days without booze   kevin rose   no way  what charity do you want it to go to? i m not giving it to you  i m gonna donate it to a charity   tim ferriss   i didn t ask you to give it to me  i don t want you to give it to me because then i m gonna have to pay taxes on it and then give it to the charity anyway   kevin rose   i m just saying we should give it to charity if you want to give it to charity   tim ferriss   i think you should give it to say    kevin rose   don t say the portland historic society   tim ferriss   kevin rose, ladies and gentlemen   kevin rose   no, he said that to me  he said that on the phone   tim ferriss   i didn t say it on the phone  you keep on bringing up these phantom phone calls   kevin rose   or over text or something   tim ferriss   the portland historic society, preservation society   kevin rose   you said you were gonna do something like that  it was email or text or some shit   tim ferriss   i think that s the proper thing to do  but in this case, just to prevent you from binge drinking for the next 30 days, since i know that s how you respond to stress  so we don t want that to happen  donorschoose org  1000 gs to donorschoose org   kevin rose   whose name should i put it in?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   you don t make it out to an individual  it s made out to donorschoose   kevin rose   you can t say in memory of?  tim ferriss   in memory of? in memory of my lovely portland house? that s what you can put in the memo  so donorschoose is, just real quick   first, a pro tip  for those of you who have any stock that is appreciated  if you re going to make charitable donations, in some cases   and i m no tax attorney   but it makes sense to donate   i didn t realize this until very recently   appreciated stock  why? because if you take  1000 that you ve earned, you re gonna have to pay income tax on that money  and then you give, say, that  1000 to charity  well, it costs you, then, 30 percent plus 30 percent and all that  now on the other hand, if you have stock that s appreciated and you have  1000 worth of that, you give the stock instead of cash to the nonprofit, and they take the full  1000 in value   kevin rose   and you can write off that full amount?  tim ferriss   as opposed to the  700 that you would give them otherwise if you sold the stock and gave the cash to them   kevin rose   that s the thing  so if you re sitting out there on some tesla stock or some crazy stock    tim ferriss   whatever   kevin rose   whatever it is, you re like, let me make my annual  1000 gift to this company, then boom  and they ll take it   tim ferriss   and the embarrassing thing for me, i m kind of flabbergasted it took me so long to figure this out  but i would go to donation pages on donorschoose org, or charitywater, or any of these places, and they would have it very clearly indicated, if you want to donate stock, click here  and i always thought to myself, why would i ever want to donate stock? i never understood the rational  and that s it  you get 30 percent more to the charity as opposed to paying it in tax dollars, so it makes a lot of sense   kevin rose   hm  cool   tim ferriss   so anyway, yeah  donorschoose org  check it out  i ve been an advisor for a long time  they re endorsed by people like michelle obama, stephen colbert, oprah  it s a long list   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    daria   what do they do?  tim ferriss   yeah, donorschoose, it basically provides funding  it allows you to fund projects in public schools in very high need areas  so if they need, say, a new blackboard, or they ve never been able to take the kids on a field trip to the aquarium, and so the kids want to be a marine biologist, whatever it is, you can then allocate funds specifically to classrooms of your choice  and you can search by zip code  so i ve donated money to, say, stem, like science, technology, engineering, math projects in places that i ve gone to school, or areas that i ve gone to school, where i grew up  and i think you still get handwritten letters from the kids, thank you letters  it s amazing  so the first nonprofit to be on the cover of fast company for their 50 most creative companies in the world issue  so it s awesome  check it out   kevin rose   sweet   tim ferriss   so now, speaking of challenges, i m about 10 days into my latest challenge   kevin rose   it is ridiculous   tim ferriss   now it seems ridiculous, but i want to provide some context for the seemingly absurd  so the challenge is called nob numb, and it s called that very deliberately   kevin rose   remember when it was just a random name you came up with?  tim ferriss   yeah  no, i thought long and hard about this name   kevin rose   so let s back up  you did a blog post about this, and you challenged your readers  and what was the challenge?  tim ferriss   so what i said, and i ve said   actually, there s something in the last episode, is that going 30 days without alcohol and masturbating and porn s a close cousin, so ixnay on the porn as well, had a dramatic impact on everything from blood values, like free testosterone, to sleep quality, on and on and on  there s a laundry list   kevin rose   what good is testosterone if you can t use it?  tim ferriss   well, i didn t say sex wasn t allowed  i said that masturbating  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    wasn t allowed  kevin rose   see, that s stupid   tim ferriss   it s not stupid, though   kevin rose   it s the same thing  it s just your hand   tim ferriss   it s not the same  no, you re married, so no offense, you ve got kind of sex on demand, i assume  as for single guys with broadband, they ve got porn on demand  and it turns into a compulsive behavior   kevin rose   why screw them over? they re having a hard time   tim ferriss   it s not a judgment call  what it is, is i m thinking of compulsive behaviors that over time can be very detrimental  and i think excessive porn viewing   check our your brain on porn  check it out   kevin rose   okay, why not say this? why not just say no porn, masturbate all you want   tim ferriss   because i think you need   you have a cache, just like a web browser, of all these ridiculous porn scenes in your head, and i think you need like a good two to four weeks to clear that stuff out, so that you re actually attracted to normal women and not crazy cyborg silicone craziness   kevin rose   so what if one went and hired a masseuse that gave lotion snap   tim ferriss   fine, you can have the    kevin rose   that s fine?  tim ferriss   you can have the dragon roll  i mean, legality aside, if you want to have the rub and tug, then it s fine   kevin rose   so why is that fine? because it s still porn, in a way   tim ferriss   there s more involved in doing that  that s an edge case, and i don t think a lot of people are gonna do it  but look  what i m trying to provide people with, and so just to give you guys an idea  so it s 30 days without   no booze, no  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    masturbating  kevin rose   you should say no sex too  it s not the same   tim ferriss   it s not the same  i think sex is a healthy behavior  i don t think excessive masturbating is a healthy behavior   kevin rose   do people really excessively masturbate? i think you kind of just masturbate and you re kind of done  you don t really   you re not hitting it three times a day   tim ferriss   i think some people are   kevin rose   really?  tim ferriss   absolutely   kevin rose   is that your go to?  tim ferriss   no, i m too lazy to do that  but we can talk about porn  we talked about porn a lot in the last episode  so if you want more porn, including some of my recommendations, check out the last episode   kevin rose   that was weird that you put your recommendations in the blog post   tim ferriss   oh, people loved it  they actually said    kevin rose   no, because your favorite porn   tim ferriss   do you want to check this out? so i mean, it s kind of weird  that guy, he was watching it, now i m watching it  it s a little creepy  but here s the thing  so one of the people who  crosstalk   00 21 51    kevin rose   i typed it in and i pulled it up, and i was like, dude, i m watching tim s porn   tim ferriss   did you see? so somebody put a google trends screenshot  all right, i ll just tell you  it s momoko and anjelica with a j   kevin rose   oh boy  don t watch it   tim ferriss   and the google trends, it s like rr rr rr, whrrr! when you hit play, if that was a startup growth chart, they d be like 50 million green   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    where the fuck were we going with this? okay, so the challenge was to help people overcome obsessive behaviors and improve the quality of their lives, and also their ability to develop new habits by creating a community on lift, which is a behavioral change app  and i was actually introduced to that by ev williams, cofounder of twitter, who incubated, effectively, this company  and if you go on lift, so lift do  kevin rose   i use it all the time   tim ferriss   almost 5000 people are live doing this nob numb challenge   kevin rose   oh boy   tim ferriss   women also   kevin rose   that s a sad thread   tim ferriss   it s not a sad thread  it s fucking fascinating   kevin rose   are they flirting with each other and shit?  tim ferriss   there s a little bit, but i mean, i think probably half the people with female avatars are sweaty palmed fat guys  so whatever  when you re on the internet, nobody knows  but i think there are also quite a few women on there  but i mean    kevin rose   you never know   tim ferriss   masturbating s, i think, more of a guy dilemma in a lot of ways  the point being, about 5000 people, and there already is really fascinating patterns emerging  so very, very common in multiple different threads, extremely vivid dreams   kevin rose   yeah, well, there s no relief, dude  you re dreaming it   tim ferriss   nothing impresses kevin rose  there s a whole long list  anyway, you can check it out  but i highly recommend, even if you re not gonna use lift for nob numb, check it out  and there are all sorts of things  flossing  it s the only thing that got me to floss regularly, and it s very, very simple  so that s that  but the challenge is ongoing  if you want to join me, that s why i m having tea instead of wine, but   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin rose   how s it going for you?  tim ferriss   it s going well  i would say that i had a pretty tough day today  i m dressed up because i went to a memorial service for a close friend, seth roberts  you will be sorely missed  and really one of the grandfathers of self experimentation, and certainly the quantified self movement of the last, let s say 20 years  but so yeah, people started drinking at about 1 00 pm today  and i really wanted to drink  i was like, god, what i wouldn t give for just a nice glass of wine  and i think that s when the challenge is most important  if i m defaulting to alcohol to treat my stress, that s a pattern that i want to be able to interrupt  so i think that it s only in those moments that the challenge is a challenge  i mean, that s the whole point of it   kevin rose   yeah  when i went those three weeks, there were certainly a lot of times where i was like, wow, it s been a long day  and i m like, gosh, i d love just a beer or something, a glass of something   tim ferriss   i just noticed, especially around here, with social outings and whatnot, i remember just one day, i was like, god, i feel kind of slow and my head hurts a little  and i looked back at my calendar, and i was like, wow  i m not drinking by myself, but i ve been out to dinners or meetings   kevin rose   dude, this is our life   tim ferriss   five nights a week for two months  and at every single outing, i m having two, three, four glasses of something   kevin rose   this is me, but i had a work meeting last night on a saturday, and i went out with daria, and i went out and had a couple glasses of wine, and they were heavy spurs  and then we met up for dinner, and it was at a sushi place, and there was sake  had some of that  and then i just get home and i m not hammered, but enough to where the next morning i woke up and i m just like, god, that s not 100 percent  yeah   tim ferriss   so i would just say this, guys  this isn t a puritanical thing  it s not to make you amish or mennonite  i love drinking  and also, pretty fond of jerking off  so this is a 30 day experiment  so i would just say    kevin rose   can they join in now, by the way? is it too late?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   yeah, join in now  no, it s not too late, and i expect this thing will survive for much longer than 30 days, so   kevin rose   what do you give people? what s the reward?  tim ferriss   i think it s    kevin rose   is there kind of a gift?  tim ferriss   no, there is  if you join right now, it s just going to be the join the community, which is very strong and extremely interesting, on lift  for people who started at the beginning, which was august 1st, then we re offering   i think it s 1500 or 2000 bucks to the three most helpful people who complete the challenge  so they have to complete the 30 days, and then they have to help other people in the community do the same   kevin rose   that s cool  the community support thing is huge  you need that   tim ferriss   oh, it s amazing   kevin rose   i could have used that when i was going through my 30 days  if someone was like, she started drinking after two weeks, she made it two weeks, then props, because she didn t have to do that at all  and then after she caved and she s having a little wine or something, or she d go out with her girlfriends and come back a little saucy  i m like, mm, i kind of want a drink right now  but anyway, let s move on   tim ferriss   move on   kevin rose   so congratulations  good luck to you, sir  blue balls  all right  let s talk about meditation   tim ferriss   yeah   kevin rose   so meditation is something that i have always wanted to get into  and if you ve been a follower of my blog, or have seen when i did have a blog back in the day, you know that every single year, for my to do list for the next year was to learn how to meditate or to get better at meditating  headspace, the app  i think we ve mentioned it on here before  have we mentioned headspace on here before?  tim ferriss   i don t think so   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin rose   okay  so there s an app called headspace that is a guided meditation app that essentially   you ve used headspace, or no?  tim ferriss   i haven t  i m smirking because i feel a moral obligation to mention calm as well, as a competitor   kevin rose   did you invest in calm?  tim ferriss   i didn t invest in calm, but a bunch of my close friends have   kevin rose   i know the founder of calm   tim ferriss   yeah, the founder, he s a smart guy  but headspace is the leader   kevin rose   so i haven t invested in either one of these companies, but i will say that those are the two leaders, right? headspace is number one  they have a big huge community  they ve been around for a lot longer  calm also has a great app  they re both awesome  so headspace is the one i kind of started getting into because lamer, who we all know, he is a big meditator, and he told me that he got hooked on headspace  so they have this thing called take 10, which is 10 days of 10 minutes of meditation per day  and it s completely guided, and it was really easy to do because 10 minutes isn t a big commitment  i just sat down at my office and i shut the door, and i put my headphones on, and i hit lay, and i went through 10 minutes  and i did that for 10 days  and i started doing more and more and more, and they graduate you to take 15, which is 15 minutes, then take 20  i did all of those for 20 days  and so flash forward  you don t even know this, but i ve done 92 sessions and 25 hours of meditation so far   tim ferriss   that s great   kevin rose   which is awesome  and i will say that it is certainly helping me in some really interesting ways  there are moments in the day now where normally, i would get stressed out or a little agitated  and i can finally use some of those principles and just kind of step back for a second, and realize that the anger doesn t exist out here  it s all in here  and i can just kind of just come to terms with that and let it go a little bit, and sit with it a little bit and let it go, which is really interesting  the other thing is, i m now up to 20 minutes a day of meditation  and this only happens every once in a while, like every third one or something  but i ll get this moment where i forget that i m meditating, but i m still doing the practice and i m  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    following my breath in and out  and i have this perfect presence where my mind just does not think about anything  i m not really thinking about anything at all  my mind s just completely free  it s the coolest internal feeling that you could feel without taking some type of substance that i have ever come across  and mine has only lasted   i ve only gotten these little windows of 20 to 30 seconds, and then my mind comes back online  but i can see for the first time, and it s been 92 sessions to get here, i can see for the first time a little glimpse of, whoa, that s what the pro meditators get hours of  and that s cool  it s pretty awesome, so  tim ferriss   it s a big deal  i m a huge proponent of meditation, and i wish there were a different label for it, quite frankly, because i think there s a lot of negative association or connotation with meditation  there s just too much historical use as it relates to hippies or a particular methodology   kevin rose   hippies, religion  that s the beautiful thing about this headspace, is it s not tied to any religion at all   tim ferriss   there are secular ways, if that s important to you, to practice this  and you could view it as mindfulness practice, or even just observational practice  and what i mean by that is, i ve been meditating for, i don t know, a year and a half or two consistently   kevin rose   how often  tim ferriss   today was twice a day  most days, it s just once in the morning   kevin rose   how many minutes?  tim ferriss   i usually do it for 15 to 20   kevin rose   awesome, dude  that s great  you must have seen some of the very similar results that i ve seen   tim ferriss   yeah, exactly the same  and what you become is   imagine if you are watching a movie of your thoughts projected onto a wall  and when you first start meditating, at some point, you re like, my god, is that really my brain all the time? it s just like a caged monkey on meth, just bouncing off the walls  it s insane  it s totally nuts  you remember, i sent this animated gift to daria of a cat trying to fight  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    an iguana  do you remember the spastic kitten? kevin rose   he s the weirdest guy to text  but you send the animated gifs all the time   tim ferriss   and i was like, this is how i feel when i m meditating  but what you start to observe, you start to be able to observe those thoughts and not just feel the thoughts  and then when you get angry, you re like, oh, that s interesting  kevin is getting angry, not me   kevin rose   right  that s not me   tim ferriss   for such and such a reason   kevin rose   yeah  yeah, that s cool   tim ferriss   and that separation of the actor and the observer is really fascinating   kevin rose   it s really cool because you can realize that that s really not you  that s just this emotional little thing firing, hormones and the other kinds of shit causing this outburst that s really not your core  that s not who you are   tim ferriss   there s also some great guided meditations on the website of sam harris  samharris org  i also did two podcasts with sam  sam s a phd in neuroscience, a very experienced meditator   kevin rose   oh, adam s gonna be working with him, right?  tim ferriss   oh, i hope so   kevin rose   oh, he s not, okay   tim ferriss   yeah, sam is brilliant  so sam and i did two podcasts  one is called drugs and the meaning of life, which is an essay read by sam  i highly recommend it  and the other was a larger exploration and discussion of meditation, imaging in neuroscience, religion, all sorts of things  samharris org has a bunch of guided meditations as well   kevin rose   i love that we do these things because honestly, i have notes here of things that i m gonna go check out  i always pick up little tidbits   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   no, it s great  any good books you ve read recently?  kevin rose   i mean, other than grain brain, and then i m starting to get into antifragile, which i    tim ferriss   antifragile s a great book  i m biased because i know nassim pretty well  i ve spent a decent amount of time with him  and i fell in love with the black swan  i thought that was a spectacular book  fooled by randomness, also very good  and i was    kevin rose   fooled by randomness, man, i listened to it, and i got it  the problem i have with his books is i listen to them, and in the first 10 minutes, i m sold  not the first 10 minutes, but the first hour of the audiobook, i m sold, and i m like, great, i m sold  and then he just keeps going on and on and on  i m like, where does this end?  tim ferriss   well, where i find   i ll play devil s advocate because i definitely know that type of book, but i didn t get that feeling from black swan, nor antifragile  antifragile s a bigger book   kevin rose   i m talking about fooled by randomness   tim ferriss   yeah, okay, so yeah  so maybe that s the case  but black swan was introduced to me by matt mullenweg, developer of wordpress  now, i guess, ceo of automatic  and really, really had a huge impact  antifragile is a big book, and the gems are spread throughout  so you have to kind of pick and choose, absorb what is useful  but i thought the concept of, say, fragile, robust and then antifragile being the real opposite of fragile as being very, very interesting  so you have, say, fragile people who care about the minority who dislike their work, like politicians, right? and then you have, say, antifragile, who are the artists who care more about the minority who like their work, right? so it s sort of how you can actually become stronger in the face of chaos or adversity  not just be resilient, but benefit from it and grow stronger  that s a fascinating book  i have that one at home marked up really significantly  i read a book that was recommended to me by james altitur called jesus  son  and this book, jesus  son, is not religious  it is a collection of short stories  i m blanking on the author s name  but it is some of the most beautiful prose i have ever read  it s fiction   kevin rose   does it have anything to do with jesus?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   no   kevin rose   how do you know it s not jesus  son?  tim ferriss   maybe it s jesus  son  could be  good point  but these stories are so brutal  i mean, they re really, really brutal stories  but the prose is so beautiful that it makes it absorbable  and it was recommended to me by a number of people i really respect as readers and writers  and i just flew through this book  i didn t expect it  but that s one, if you re looking for something to read that is fiction that you can probably digest in a day or two, that s a great read as well   kevin rose   sweet   tim ferriss   so let s hop on to some other stuff, yeah?  kevin rose   yeah, yeah  all right  so i want to show you an app called sup  it s a new app that s   i don t have any affiliation with this app  i just saw it for the first time yesterday  i just want to show it to you because i think it s pretty funny that it s just a random app  so i just sent a request to daria for sup  and she s gonna receive it here in a second  i like apps that are just pushing the boundaries  so look, it says connecting to daria right now  and we can shoot broll of this afterwards, yeah? we ll reshoot some stuff  and then what happens is, you get a live connection with your friend  watch this  it s about to begin  and then now she s shooting us live, and then i can tell her which way to turn the camera   tim ferriss   oh, that s cool   kevin rose   and then i m extending the time by hitting the little heart here  i m like, turn it this way, turn it this way, turn it this way  and actually, you know what? i want to see what s up on the ceiling there  and then she ll note it  and it says on her screen, turn  isn t that awesome?  tim ferriss   that s really cool   kevin rose   turn over here  my buddy danny was at a concert the other day, and so he was like   i could say, give me a selfie  i hit that button, and then she can do a little selfie here  isn t that pretty sweet?  tim ferriss   that s cool  i like that   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin rose   so this is just a fun little thing that   there she is  isn t that amazing?  tim ferriss   oh, that s great  that s cool  i like that   kevin rose   so we don t talk about   well, i guess we do talk about apps every once in a while  sup is just a fun way to, if you have a friend out doing something cool   my buddy danny was at outside lands the other day, and he was watching a concert  and i knew he had backstage passes, and so i hit him up, and then he was livestreaming it to me, and i could just get a little window into his life  and so there s no audio associated with it, so you don t have to worry about any of that stuff   tim ferriss   yeah  that s fun   kevin rose   i like it when i meet an entrepreneur or i see a startup that is not   i mean, in my line of work and on the investing side, you just see a lot of the same old stuff   tim ferriss   yeah   kevin rose   or a slight little variation, or something different   tim ferriss   you see a lot of crap   kevin rose   you see a lot of crap  i mean, you re in the same world  and so this was new and unique and fun, and i just thought, i don t know that this is gonna be a big business  i don t know that it s really gonna take off, but you know what? hats off to them for trying something different, you know? and it s kind of a fun little thing  so i just wanted to give them a plug   tim ferriss   cool  do you think we re in a tech bubble? i want you to chime in on this   kevin rose   there s certainly more capital available now for startups in the bay area, the silicon valley area, then i ve ever seen  it s easier to get funded than ever before  what do you consider to be a bubble? i mean    tim ferriss   what would you consider a bubble?  kevin rose   so what i think is that every time another tech company ipos, whether it s a twitter, or gopro, or you name it, you have to imagine that these companies are 500 to 1000 people or more  and  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    you instantly create several hundred millionaires, or 100 millionaires, or whatever it may be  and those are an angel gets their wings  they instantly become angel investors, right? a lot of people are like, hey, i get tech  i worked at an awesome startup, i made some money  now i want to go invest in other things  tim ferriss   there are thousands of new angel investors in the last two years   kevin rose   so you jump back to 2006, when i first started really seriously angel investing, and there was just   not a handful of us, but a hundred of us  and now there s thousands  so those people have to go through the process of losing their money  not completely, but they ll place some bad bets  some people will realize that investing s not for them  they re not good at picking companies, or whatever it may be  and then those investors will fade away and say, screw it  i m sticking with my smp 500 and my wealth front, and i m happy  at the same time, new companies are ipoing and new investors are being born  and so there s this reinforcing bubble that s continuing on  but it s not hurting anyone  it s not like back in 2000, when companies would ipo, and you d have my mom and dad putting their life savings into a tech company, and they d lose all their money, right? that s not happening  so i feel like, who care if there s a bubble? it s not hurting the average consumer, so it s some wealthy tech people losing their money  the stats right now are about two out of every 10 companies actually make it  and so advice for would be new angel investors, because i see a lot of people that have made some money, and they re like, hey, how do i get started in this world, is that don t just invest in one or two companies  but if you re really gonna be serious about this, go on and do those 10 to 15 to 20 companies so that you have an entire portfolio, so you re spreading your risk out across several companies, rather than just concentrating it on just two or three  so i think that certainly, valuations are higher than i ve seen them in a long time, and there s more investors than i ve seen in a long time  so you could consider that a bubble, but one that when it bursts, no one really gets hurt   tim ferriss   depends on if it s constrained to the private markets   kevin rose   that s true  and the jobs act is changing some of that stuff, so that could bleed into the average investor   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    but i don t know  tim ferriss   that s true  what sort of personal improvement projects are you working on these days besides the meditation  kevin rose   i m been doing lumosity a lot, which i actually like  i think it s making me a little bit sharper  as you get into your later 30s, like i am now, certain things   and i m sure you ve noticed it as well   tim ferriss   well, i feel like i m 80 because i have lyme disease right now   kevin rose   well, i know that, which is horrible, but you know what i m talking about  in general, before all that   tim ferriss   yeah   kevin rose   there s these little things  other than that, personal improvement projects, the gym  actually, the gluten free thing has done wonders for my beer gut, which has gone down considerably   tim ferriss   are you doing more than benching? are you doing back exercises?  kevin rose   why?  tim ferriss   i m just kidding   kevin rose   back exercises? you can t just go to the gym and just bench?  tim ferriss   i don t know  it seems like you bench press a lot  and you have very, very manly chesticles   kevin rose   dude, i ve got some good arms, too  you re just jealous because my arms are bigger than yours now   tim ferriss   oh, here we go  here we go   kevin rose   these are testicles  did you say testicles?  tim ferriss   no, i said chesticles   kevin rose   oh, it s chesticles  i thought you meant testicles   tim ferriss   you might have very nice testicles as well  i haven t had a chance to, you know   kevin rose   one of the things i do do that actually i would recommend to  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    anyone out there that has really trimmed me up, i ve tried a bunch of stuff  tim ferriss   corsets?  kevin rose   no   tim ferriss   okay   kevin rose   i did, actually, kind of  here, i ll explain  i ll explain  how are you not drunk? you re acting like you re drunk   tim ferriss   get lyme disease  you re high all day  it s amazing   kevin rose   so here s the thing  i ve been searching for a long time to find a way to get some cardio in and make it fun  cardio takes a lot of time  it s kind of a pain in the ass, blablabla  you can do high intensity interval training, that s fine  but here s the deal  i got a treadmill at home  i invested in a treadmill, got one  and i have my ipad with me, so i can do miscellaneous ipad stuff  the problem is, you go too fast on the treadmill and you re balancing all over the place  you get seasick, and you re like, i m done, right?  tim ferriss   right   kevin rose   so what i did is i bought a weight vest  and i found an article on the internet that shows that all of the new   you know the new avengers movie coming out, the new x men and all that stuff? all the trainers there made them wear 20 pound weight vests around everywhere they went, three months prior to the movie or whatever, right?  tim ferriss   this is a lot more tiring than you might think   kevin rose   yeah, it drains you real quick   tim ferriss   it s ridiculous   kevin rose   so what i do is i set my incline to 10 percent on the treadmill  the speed to two miles an hour, so it s a nice, slow walk  put the 20pound weight vest on and then flip open my ipad mini, and i play kingdom rush, which is a great game, and a few other games  and i ll be sitting there, totally in my game  i look up, and it s 45 minutes in  i got 60 minutes  i am drenched  i mean, absolutely   i m having to move my ipad away because the sweat is falling off my face  and then i come in the house and i shower, and it wasn t  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    like i even worked out  it was like i just played games for an hour  tim ferriss   that s cool   kevin rose   and it s awesome  and the fat just falls off   tim ferriss   dude, you know what you should do is get an oculus rift and play some karate game so you can do it on the treadmill while you re walking   kevin rose   that s a fad  oculus rift is dead   tim ferriss   what? really? do you believe that?  kevin rose   i think vr is just dead   tim ferriss   a lot of the big gaming producers are building out games that are dependent on vr, or at least oculus rift   kevin rose   and they were on the wii with the freaking thing that you moved around   tim ferriss   really?  kevin rose   see, i think once    tim ferriss   i m sure the hardcore gamers are gonna love it  somebody was telling me the other day, or a few weeks ago   they re like, you don t understand  football ,man  you re gonna be putting the thing on, you re gonna be in the helmet  it ll be crazy  and i m like, yeah  i m gonna go to a super bowl party and i m gonna walk in, and there s gonna be 30 people with oculuses on their heads   kevin rose   i think that the football use case and all of that is minor compared to the potential for a second life like utopia  well, i m really excited about second life  i told you about hifi, right? high fidelity?  tim ferriss   well, i ve heard about it  you didn t tell me about it, though  tell me more  oh, it s the same guy that created   philip?  kevin rose   yeah, philip rosedale, the guy that created second life, is creating a new virtual world  it s gonna be freaking awesome   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   i think that s a big deal   kevin rose   absolutely   tim ferriss   have you read snow crash by neal stephenson?  kevin rose   yeah   tim ferriss   so i think it s gonna be like that  i mean, i think that you ll have people in less than ideal circumstances, all the way up to the top of the food chain, who are going to treat this potentially secondary world with highly developed technology like oculus rift   it ll become the time intensive equivalent of what people are doing with, say, world of warcraft  there are people who spend 20 to 50 hours a week   kevin rose   i get it   tim ferriss   you look at, what the fuck is it? the kardashian app that is pulling   it s  100 to  200 million in revenue, which is just a fantasy world  i think it s just called famous, right? where you pay money to try to become famous, sign with an agent and do different commercials and advertisements  but imagine if you could do that from pov  i don t know, man    00 45 06  kevin rose   you should do that for your   call it timtim, like an app  and you have to go work out at the gym and eat beans and protein   tim ferriss   that sound really    kevin rose   that would be amazing   tim ferriss   that sounds like a gripping game  it s like, do you want two more dollars for another spoonful of lentils?  kevin rose   it s like, do you want antibiotics or anabolic steroids? hm, what would tim choose? the steroids   tim ferriss   contracted lyme disease  timeout for five hours  or you can buy doxycycline for five tim dollars   kevin rose   for timtim points  you re like, i ll take the timtim bucks   tim ferriss   oh god   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin rose   dude, i will be a whale on your game and spend a ton of money if you make that game  that would be amazing  i m like, i m gonna buy timtim bucks   tim ferriss   timtim bucks  tim bucks  oh jesus   kevin rose   all right, so let s move on   tim ferriss   yeah   kevin rose   so i showed you   well, your turn   tim ferriss   well, this is not something i want to spend a lot of time on, but i was more nervous than i ve been in ages about a week ago when i did my first email to this list that i ve been accumulating since 2007  so when i made my first homepage and kind of sketched it out, it included an email capture because that s what everybody told me i should do, and then i promptly forgot about the whole thing, and didn t want to email people because i didn t want to get an email myself, yaddayaddayadda  and then went back and looked at it not too long ago and saw that i had between 200 and 300,000 email addresses  somewhere thereabouts  and so really got in touch with all the experts to sort of reengage with awebber, and did my first mailing out to folks  because i feel like with blogs, right? blogs are considered very old fashioned in a lot of ways, right? in the world of new social media apps and so on, blogs are considered kind of old fashioned  but i find that i do my best thinking in longer form on the blog  and i ve struggled with how to get that out because it s so noisy  and let s say i put out a post on facebook  because facebook wants you to   they ll throttle you back because they want you to boost it and pay to promote it to your audience  so you only hit 10 to 15 percent of your audience  and then twitter, twitter s amazing, but it s become so popular  and i think actually advertising   and i m testing some advertising on twitter right now   can be very effective  but if you re just using your follower base, if you put out a tweet, and most people are following a few hundred people, it s like throwing an orange golf ball into a roaring rapid  i mean, that stuff gets pushed down so quickly, you re probably also only hitting a very small percentage   kevin rose   right  why orange? probably a white one would be harder to see   tim ferriss   well, if it s white, you wouldn t see it at all   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin rose   right  but orange, you would see a little bit?  tim ferriss   yeah, that s my sort of metaphorical assumption   kevin rose   just checking   tim ferriss   if you prefer, bright blue  we could use bright blue  it s funny that sort of   i ve gone full circle, and it looks like i ll be focusing a lot on email and the blog, where i can actually get now, instead of, say, 10 percent of my audience or five percent of my audience seeing a blog post, get 50 percent of my audience potentially seeing a blog post  and i ve already seen such a massive uptick in comments, in sharing, in everything  it s been really eye opening   kevin rose   so what does the next three years look like for you? because you ve done so much   tim ferriss   oh, man   kevin rose   well, hold on  you ve done so much crazy stuff over the years  you ve got this great audience of people that obviously want to learn how to create a better lifestyle for themselves, how to get in shape, how to cook better  you ve done all these awesome things  what s next? what s the   are you doing another big thing, or are you gonna just focus on the core that you already have, or?  tim ferriss   i haven t decided  there are a few things that i d really like to do  i have been working on my first screenplay, and that s been really fun for me to do  people have approached me over the years about something with an adaptation of the four hour work week  and a lot of the back story is not in there  i mean, the wild adventures and misadventures and craziness from that year and ahalf of traveling the world is not really out there, published  and so i ve been playing around  it would be a comedy  it would be kind of like fight club meets dodgeball, something like that  it d be    kevin rose   brad pitt throwing balls around   tim ferriss   yeah, sure  yeah, we could go there  or ben stiller as my arch nemesis in the world of tango  ben, if you re listening, please talk  come in  but i ve been having a lot of fun with screenplays, and i ve been reading a lot of screenplays, which are like novels that  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    take an hour and a half to read  it s awesome  reading screenplays is super fun  i recommend the king s speech  i recommend casablanca, if you want to go super classic  my favorite of all time, probably the princess bride  that is so good  william goldman s just a genius  fight club s great  fear and loathing in las vegas is pretty good  but if i m gonna do a next big project, i think it would look something like a feature film  kevin rose   do you think your audiobook stuff will continue to be a big thing?  tim ferriss   i m really enjoying the tim ferriss bookclub stuff, and i ve been acquiring audiobooks  the next book that s coming out    kevin rose   i m really excited for   well, i ve told you this on multiple episodes, but i think that s the coolest thing you re working on right now   tim ferriss   really?  kevin rose   i mean, it s cool  it s awesome  you re revitalizing all these old books, and i think it s really sweet   tim ferriss   i m super excited  i can t name the next book yet, but this is gonna be the first book    kevin rose   what is the first letter?  tim ferriss   w   kevin rose   are you serious?  tim ferriss   yeah   kevin rose   interesting  i ll have to figure that out   tim ferriss   so but this is the first book, people are gonna slowly, when they look back at the bookclub, if it works out as i m hoping, when they look and see   there are about four or five books right now  love all of them  and you can just go to fourhourworkweek, all spelled out,  com books  so fourhourworkweek com books to see all of them  but so far, it s just been audiobooks  the next book, i actually have the audio and the ebook rights  i ve been figuring out so much with these various launches that i  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    think there will be a point where i m basically   i would like to take the digital and the audio and blow that out of the water  i mean, just load it into this cannon and shoot it into outer space as far as amazon sales and so on, and awareness and pr concern  what i d like to do is potentially partner with traditional publishers to have them handle the print edition and retail distribution  astonishingly to me   kevin rose   are you a complete publisher at that point?  tim ferriss   well, i would be a publisher, but i wouldn t be a complete publisher because i don t want to deal with the print  it s not my area of expertise   kevin rose   right, but you re outsourcing that to them  but why do you need to outsource it? why not just have it printed on the side   well, i guess they have all the distribution stuff   tim ferriss   i d like them   yeah, because they have sales departments and relationships that they can capitalize on for the retail distribution  i think that s valuable   kevin rose   sure   tim ferriss   especially if, for instance, imagine this, i become a talent scout, and i find people who have never published books, but who have amazing writing capabilities  and i kind of coach them through the process  and this wouldn t be   this is not my main financial thing  it s actually a huge time investment for not very much financial return  but i m so passionate about the idea that   and this might seem like a ridiculous comparison, but the way that, say, eminem discovered   and i believe it was eminem  maybe it was dr  dre who discovered 50 cent?  kevin rose   i think it was just dre   tim ferriss   well, dre discovered eminem  then eminem discovered 50 cent  and i think   who discovered rihanna? was that also eminem?  kevin rose   i have no idea   tim ferriss   anyway, somebody ll correct me  but the idea that you could be like, that s talent, but they re gonna get chewed up the system, and they re gonna make too many mistakes that could be fatal, great   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    here are the people you need, here s the toolkit you need  and then shoot them off into outer space  the idea of being able to do that is really exciting  kevin rose   i want you to do a romance novel   tim ferriss   you want me to write a romance novel?  kevin rose   i think you ve got it in you   tim ferriss   how about a bromance novel? i could just write about us   kevin rose   that s right  whatever  just think of a fake name for me and i ll be all good   tim ferriss   let me tell you one thing, because i know we ve talked a lot about sort of next chapters, and what are we gonna do, and things like that   kevin rose   i ll talk about my next chapter   tim ferriss   yeah  well, i want you to  so one thing that i realized, i had a really profound civics retreat into the wilderness recently  that sounds so weird  but i spent a lot of time in nature with a couple of very close friends   kevin rose   what were you doing out there?  tim ferriss   that sounds equally weird  i was experimenting with medicinal plants  let s call it that  and    kevin rose   i wasn t there, for the record   tim ferriss   and you were not there   kevin rose   i wanted to go, but i was scared   tim ferriss   it was a good decision you didn t go   kevin rose   you know how weak i am  fragile   tim ferriss   no, not weak  you re not yet antifragile in that department    kevin rose   can you grab me a beer, babe? babe, can you please grab me a water? thank you  i call my wife babe   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   she s hot   kevin rose   she is hot   tim ferriss   what i was gonna say is    kevin rose   so is your girlfriend, so that s fine   tim ferriss   yes, that s true  so i was really having this kind of existential crisis trying to decide what my next project was gonna be  and i love the tech investing, but honestly, there s so much happening right now, i find it kind of overwhelming  i mean, just so many emails, so many meetings   kevin rose   we ve talked about this so many times   tim ferriss   it s extremely overwhelming  and it s an enviable problem to have, of course, but it s still a very significant source of anxiety, i think  because you want to be responsive, you want to be helpful, but there are so many   the barriers to entry with tech startups are so low, you just get   you can be in the middle of a tsunami really quickly  so i was debating all this stuff  no thank you   kevin rose   okay, just checking   tim ferriss   so what my friend said to me, he said   he s also actually involved in tech  and he said, i really owe you a debt of gratitude  i won t name you by name in case you don t want to be named in that context  but he said, there are a lot of venture capitalists out there  there are a lot of investors  and if you don t invest in a company that s really promising, somebody else will just take your place  there s no shortage of capital  and he s like, the good companies will get funded no matter what   kevin rose   sure   tim ferriss   and he said, but   and he saw me at an event where i had multiple people in line come up to me sort of crying because they d lost 100 plus pounds, and they had these dramatic changes  he was like, you re never gonna have that impact investing in companies  you re replaceable as a vc  and he s like, you should stick with your writing  keep writing  and that had a really huge impact on me  and that s part of the reason why i ve reshifted, and i m  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    focusing a lot on the last few blog posts i ve put a ton of time into, and i m really happy with the response  kevin rose   that s awesome, dude  i m glad to see that because i love your content too, and i think that you re awesome at doing that stuff  and more of that is better for the earth, so   tim ferriss   i m enjoying it  but i m sure you   we don t have to dig too deep with this, but it s very seductive to focus on the things that are not bad   you don t dislike them   that provide the highest financial return   kevin rose   sure   tim ferriss   and that s generally not creating content  but that s not the only return  that s not the only roi you can have for investing your time, certainly  so that s been a big one for me  but enough about me  tell me, your next chapter  what s going on?  kevin rose   i mean, there s nothing new to talk about today other than the fact that i ve been really enjoying the whole creative process side again  i ve gotten involved in creating some new applications  and so i ve got a buddy of mine, mark hymien, who i worked with briefly at digg  daniel berker was my main designer there for many years, and then mark was hired to work with us a little bit later  and he s a really good product guy, and really good, just awesome designer, both mobile and web and all over the place, and also actually a pretty good artist   tim ferriss   that s a cool combo   kevin rose   yeah, he s really talented up and down  so i ve been prototyping some stuff on the weekends  just sitting out and building some new apps, both on the desktop and on mobile  i have three or four ideas right now that i ve just kind of been sitting on and starting to flesh out a little bit  and it s weird because i just feel really   i mean, daria ll tell you  i ve just been working  not working, vetting companies and going and having coffee working, because that s what i do every week  but this is me in my office just on a whiteboard and having mark come over, and we re brainstorming ideas and going through mockups, and trying out different flows, and talking about how things come together, and working developers  and it s been fun  and to get those creative juices going again and starting something new   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   it s just like me with my writing   kevin rose   it s the best   tim ferriss   you re creating something  you re creating something from nothing   kevin rose   and it feels really good   tim ferriss   as opposed to just filtering  you know what i mean? and it s not that you can t be helpful, but there s something viscerally rewarding about taking something in here that doesn t exist and creating something tangible, whether that s digital or physical, that people can interact with  i mean, it s so gratifying  and i remember talking to you on the phone not too long ago, and i was like, you sound a lot more excited than you ve sounded in a while   kevin rose   well, it s crazy because there s two independent moments that got me pretty excited to get back into this  one was, i was at blue bottle coffee, having some coffee, meeting with a founder  and this kid just grabbed me randomly, like i m sure fans do with you every once in a while  and i was like, awesome, what are you working on? he s like, oh, i ve got this startup, blablabla  i just love digg nation  i used to love digg  and i was like, oh, thanks, appreciate it  and he s like, when s your next startup? and i m like, oh, dude, i m a full time vc  and it s like i had just shot the kid s dog  his face just dropped down, and he s like   and he looked at me and he s just like, you re not gonna start something new? he was expecting me to create the next thing  and it didn t hit me right away  i was like, oh, i m sorry, and i had to run, so i took off  and then later on, i was like, wow, that guy   it was clear to me that he really enjoyed something that i had created in the past, as i m sure you get with your readers and stuff  and it was like, wow  i should keep doing that  why not? that s what i love the most  and the other piece   that was one story  the other one was, i had gotten to know, luckily, tony fidel quite well  he was the original guy that created the ipod, created nest later on  you probably saw my foundation interview with him, foundation kr if you haven t seen those videos yet, and go to that website  a lot of great entrepreneurs there  i sat down with him, and he created nest  he sold it to google  and so i see him a lot more because he s always around at google  and we were out and having a drink, and i was like, gosh, what keeps you going?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    because i won t say what his net worth is, but it s a lot  i would imagine he s   well, i don t know, but i mean, the sale was public about what he sold it to google for and stuff like that  so i imagine he s got a billion dollars, right? tim ferriss   yeah   kevin rose   and i m like, what keeps you going? what drives you to do all the stuff that you do? and he s just like, it was about the passion around creativity and wanting to just invent and create and be mixed in with the people that are doing amazing things  and i was listening to his story  and he has kids and a wife, and he s traveling a lot, and it was just like, the dude is juggling 10x what i am, and he s just doing it with ease  and he s just a badass, just can execute like none other   tim ferriss   what s the secret sauce?  kevin rose   his secret sauce is just understanding that   and this is my take on it  this isn t what he said to me, but kind of distilling down everything that we talked about, it s just that he understand that   i feel that more or less that you only have so   you never know what s gonna happen to you, right? we talked about this  you went to your friend s memorial today   tim ferriss   yeah, he was just as  inaudible   well, we talked about this  i mean, he displayed no aberrant, unusual systems of any type  was going out hiking with a close friend  met up with friends and family in the days preceding it, totally fine, and they re still doing a full sort of coroner s investigation and whatnot  but just dropped dead  and similarly, one of my brother s best friend s girlfriends   i mean, this is a woman in her 20s, perfectly healthy from all outward indications, in an office, has an aneurysm, drops dead   kevin rose   yeah  well, the guy   so the lead engineer for boost it boards, those automatic skateboards that you may have saw on the kickstarter that you can control with your hand, which i got a prototype of and was using, a couple week ago, two weeks ago, was in san francisco on a boost it board going like this, just controlling it  drops dead  brain aneurysm   tim ferriss   so you never know, guys   kevin rose   here s the whole thing  at the end of the day, i was sitting there listening to that, and i m like, you and i have both been very  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    blessed, and we ve done some awesome stuff and gotten rewarded for it  and so i can kind of fade off in the future and be this little investor and live my little life, and go down and drink my coffee with my founders and come back home, and drink my glass of wine and go to bed, and call that a day  or i can step back up to the plate and try some crazy shit again, and just see where it takes me  and i was like, why don t i just go do some crazy stuff? so i m still a full time investor at google ventures and doing all that stuff  but there s nothing preventing me from hacking on stuff and doing little things  so i m having fun doing it  tim ferriss   i m all for it, man  i think you should keep it up   kevin rose   so anyway, that is that  oh, last thing i wanted to talk about  do you have anymore, or are you good?  tim ferriss   no, i m good   kevin rose   so that last thing, we always talk a little about hobbies and stuff like that  one of the things that   i don t know if we talk about hobbies ever   tim ferriss   we always talk about little hobbies   kevin rose   little hobbies  one of the things in the last two or three months is a friend of mine, a couple friends of mine, have gotten me excited about wristwatches  and at first, you think wristwatches and you think, oh boy, why? we have time on our phones  why would you ever want a watch on your wrist?  tim ferriss   that s my question, precisely my question   kevin rose   and my buddy   you know kevin s sister  and he would kill me for calling him out, but whatever  well, i mean, he can watch this  kevin, you know i ve had a couple drinks  so basically, kevin s a good guy, and he was saying that the only jewelry we have as men   women have earrings, they have necklaces, stuff like that  the only thing we have other than t shirts is a watch, a nice timepiece, right?  tim ferriss   you could get some earrings   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin rose   i could get some earrings  and so i wasn t into watches at all  my dad passed away a few years ago  and he left me two watches  my dad was by no means a wealthy man  i would consider him   we were very poor for many years, and then eventually, he broke into the middleclass, like standard middleclass, and he bought a rolex watch, two of them, actually  one a little bit older, and one new  and those were his prized positions  in fact, the second one that he bought, he never wore, ever  he was like, i m saving this  he never put it on  he put it on twice  but it s flawless  so anyway, i inherited that stuff  and i was like, wow, this is kind of cool  it s my dad s stuff  and so that was kind of attractive  and then i started learning more about the fact that there s still innovation happening in these timepieces, and there s these artisan craftsmen that still work in this field, this dying field, making these amazing new innovations in mechanical   not digital, but straight up traditional hand wound watches  and so i started getting into it  i actually traveled out to germany with daria, and we went out to this place called lange and sohne, which is this awesome little boutique that they only make 5000 or so watches per year  and we got to meet them  and i hadn t bought a really crazy watch  and i met this team and walked through this whole compound in germany, and it was a few hundred people  and they hand polish every little part  they care so much about how these watches go together  little tiny town in the middle of nowhere  you fly into dresden, then you drive about an hour anda half away  and they assemble them, check the time, make sure they use all these fancy gauges, disassemble them and then clean them again, and then reassemble them  and they only make about 100 per year per type of watch  and so i was like, wow, this is really cool  and on top of that, you realize when you invest in something like this, especially something that s not so much a rolex, but they make a million a year, they make a million rolexes a year, that something real small and boutiquey, they actually go up in value  so it s like, in your head, you say, okay, well, i d normally put this much in my 401(k) per year  i m gonna carve out a little bit   tim ferriss   just this, hold on   kevin rose   i know it s creepy   tim ferriss   don t put your 401(k) money into timepieces, please   kevin rose   listen  that s true  but what i m saying is, i started following  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    some of the blogs  one in particular, hodinkee, which you should check out if you re at all curious about this, is probably the best watch blog out there  tim ferriss   hodinkee?  kevin rose   yeah   tim ferriss   how do you spell it?  kevin rose   h o d i n k e e com   tim ferriss   i knew there was gonna be some twist  okay  too es   kevin rose   but anyway, check it out  it s a really great blog  and you start to learn a lot about what goes into all these things  and some of them can track the moon phases and do really crazy stuff  so anyway, this is one that i picked up here about three weeks ago  it just came out  it s actually made by swatch, of all brands  this here, this watch here is called the system 51  and it s because it has 51 parts, which is like it s an automatic watch, meaning it s selfwinding when you wear it  but 51 parts, and it s all machineassembled  it s the first fully automatic, meaning self winding, machine assembled watch  it has 17 new patents  it s very collectible  it s  150  you can buy it now   150  i mean, that s pretty awesome  it s not crazy, and it s just like a pretty cool watch  and it winds itself when you wear it  and it has a lot of horological significance  and that s what they call people who are into time keeping   tim ferriss   horologists   kevin rose   horologists  laugh all you want  but anyway   tim ferriss   you were waiting for me to laugh  i m just waiting for you to continue   kevin rose   anyway, so i started kind of getting into the whole scene of learning more about it, and just starting to appreciate this stuff  and it s funny, you meet other people, and they ll tell you something very unique about their little timepiece  and if you re into engineering and you like that side of things, which i think all geeks do, you can understand what goes into the manufacturing and why it s pretty awesome  so anyway   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   i haven t had a watch in years  i might actually get a watch, not because i m gonna collect it, but because i like to take sort of a technology sabbath on saturdays  and i try to go screenless on saturdays  so no phones   kevin rose   dude, pick up one of these guys   tim ferriss   but it s kind of a pain in the ass to keep track of time, so it d be nice to have just some lightweight watch   kevin rose   i mean, this is one of those things where i think that in the next not five or 10, but maybe 20 years, this thing will probably be five, 10 times the value of what it is today  but i mean, it s  150  but it s a freaking cool watch  and this is a very significant watch  and the whole scene was blowing up about how crazy this watch is, for the engineering that s gone into it   tim ferriss   cool   kevin rose   but what s crazy about swatch that you don t know, and this is getting a little geeky, and i promise we can stop the show  but swatch owns almost all of the shit out there  they do all the internals for almost all the major brands  and they own   they re a huge company  forget the retail stores and the little plastic cheap watches  they have all the engineering  consider them the intel inside of all of their watches   tim ferriss   that s kind of cool   kevin rose   oh yeah   tim ferriss   where are they based? are they swiss, or where are they based?  kevin rose   yeah  so you and buy cartier, or a high end designer watch, like a harry winston or a cartier or something like that  some of those are this brand called etta   tim ferriss   patek  where you put patek phillipe there   kevin rose   so patek phillipe and lange are tied in my line neck and neck for the number one brand in the world  they re both amazing   tim ferriss   do they use the intel inside?  kevin rose   no   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   they don t use any technology?  kevin rose   so those are all considered original movements where they have their own in house manufacturing and their own in house engineers that actually make all the internal movements  we actually met the head guy, the head engineer, at lange, and he had dinner with us  it was amazing  i mean, this guy, all he does is build these little tiny   i mean, they re so small, the number of components that go in here   tim ferriss   yeah, that is  inaudible    kevin rose   it s just fascinating  and it s a simple old school thing  but for me, you ve got to understand  i m doing tech all 24 7  that s all i do  to break away from that and actually have a conversation with someone that s brilliant in a non internet way is so nice   tim ferriss   that s so much fun   kevin rose   yeah, totally   tim ferriss   that s part of what was so fun about being out on the east coast for a bit, is you just have more diversity of interests, quite frankly, and also industry   kevin rose   like an old, old wooden ship? diversity? do you know diversity?  tim ferriss   what? i have no idea what you re talking about   kevin rose   have you ever seen anchorman?  tim ferriss   no, i actually haven t   kevin rose   what the fuck?

45,46,46: The Random Show ,"   hello, boys and girls, this is tim ferriss  and welcome to another episode of the tim ferriss show  for those of you new to the show, this program is really dedicated to trying to dissect excellence, to deconstruct how the best in the world do what they do best  and that can range from billionaire investors to chess prodigies, to stand up comics, to seven time new york times bestselling authors, and everyone in between, professional athletes, people from the fbi  it gets crazy  this particular episode is an anomaly  this is an audio version of the random show, which is something i do with my buddy kevin rose, who s a general partner at google ventures, has also started a bunch of different companies, very, very successful angel investor and product guy, as they call them in silicon valley  and this is generally a video show  and the video, as well as the show notes for this audio can be found at fourhourworkweek com podcast, all spelled out  fourhourworkweek com podcast  that s also where you can find all of the other interviews and in between  inaudible  and all that juicy stuff  but there will be a couple of things that lack visual cues given this is audio, but it s a lot like a stand up comedy cd  most of it should make sense on audio  so without further preamble, please enjoy the random show   kevin rose   well, hello, welcome to another episode of the random show   tim ferriss   number 279   kevin rose   that s right   tim ferriss   i m tim ferriss   kevin rose   and i m kevin rose  we are your random guests for tonight  and we are normally the guests, so we re here at your house   tim ferriss   randomly consistent   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin rose   randomly at your house   tim ferriss   and we are having what?  kevin rose   some awesome wine from our friend will harlan  this is the matriarch 2003  will is a buddy of ours  he gave us a bottle of wine  he actually broke this over to my house the other night for daria s birthday dinner thing after her birthday dinner thing  it s hard to explain   tim ferriss   the after party   kevin rose   we had a dinner the night after her birthday  he came by, dropped it off, didn t get a chance to crack it, so we figured we crack it here  and it s awesome wine   tim ferriss   matriarch   kevin rose   obviously harlan estates, matriarch, everything that he does is just like awesome   tim ferriss   and we have a few accoutrement for the wine  number one, gifted to me by my girlfriend is a coyote head pourer, which may be hard to see here, but it comes right out the mouth hole like that, which is amazing   very game of thrones  looks a bit like a dire wolf  and because i know that it would just horrify will, we re using beakers  these are kimax beakers that i use for urinalysis in the morning typically, but not only  it s also a perfect 200 milliliters  i also have 250 milliliters, which means that you can get three perfect glasses in one bottle of wine because bottles of wine are typically standardized to 750 milliliters   kevin rose   you ve never used this for urine  that s right  that s a joke, right?  tim ferriss   probably not   kevin rose   i wouldn t put it past you   tim ferriss   you have like a one in twelve likelihood   kevin rose   alright   tim ferriss   alright   kevin rose   so let s get right into the show people  we ve got a lot of stuff to talk about  one thing i want to talk about real quick is a new  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    announcement that i have  i ve launched a new app  i have for the people out there that have watched the show, you probably know by now that i typically am a full time partner at google ventures  i ve now reduced my time to part time at google ventures, and i am a full time entrepreneur now  so i have a little company called north  we build a bunch of different apps out there  high five  and this is our second app  so our second app is called watchville  it s available at watchville co, and it is basically a tool for kind of what i consider to be like an underserved market, like it s the watch, slash, watch enthusiast  and i m talking about old school wrist watches, not like smartwatches  tim ferriss   man jewelry   kevin rose   man jewelry, no, it s not man jewelry  this is the thing about   it s funny you should say man jewelry because a buddy of mine   so the quick little 10 second version   and i ve talked about this on a previous random show, but how i got into watches was that   it s a horrible story, but the first time i actually wore a serious watch was when my dad passed away  and he left me a watch that he worked very hard for, which is a rolex that he wore all the time, same one  he didn t have a lot of watches  he wasn t wealthy  but he had that one that he really cared about, and i would always watch him polish it when i was a little kid  and i was left that, and i would wear one of   like his watch out when i was going out to like nice events and stuff like that  and i was like this is kind of cool  and a buddy of mine was like,  you know, that s funny you re wearing a watch   he goes,  it s the only jewelry men can really wear and get away with   and i was like,  actually, that s a good point   i started reading some of the blogs  i started reading the blogs on mobile  and there was no tool that pulled together all of the best content, all the best like watch blogs out there, along with some tools for like actually setting your watch and tracking what s going on with it  so the other side of the app, outside of the best news around the web, is a time setting tool, so current moon phase indicator, gives you leap year for watches that require that  it averages out all the different atomic time   atomic clocks out there, to give you the most precise time for setting your watch  and that s important for people that care about like is their watch running fast or is it running slow, things like that  but it s just a free little app  if you  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    like watches, or if you re watch curious or anything like that, i hope you ll check it out and download it  it s watchville  tim ferriss   watch curious   kevin rose   watch curious   tim ferriss   like vicarious   kevin rose   sure  if you re just like   you know, i was about a year, year and a half ago   i was just like,  oh, that s interesting  i m curious what it s all about   and then i started reading the blogs  and the first thing that you come to realize is that it s not about just like these   wearing a brand for brand s sake  there s people that walk into a store and they re like,  i have to have,  you know, name the watch  they put in like a  inaudible  or a rolex  and they just like buy based on brand  when you really get into it, the geeks, the people that are the true collectors, they understand the movements, like they understand the watchmaker, like where they came from, why they make   i mean it s like people that are really into cars and engines and things like that  you go in there, they re like,  oh, they use the blued screws there over you know, a quarter inch, like german silver    kevin rose   you know, like they know every little facet of it  and it really is a geeky thing  like i m a tech geek, and like i can appreciate the engineering and the effort that goes into this stuff, once you get into that side of things   tim ferriss   i think it s also a really smart thing  so you and i were having dinner not too long ago, before the launch, at blue plate, which is a great restaurant here in san francisco  i highly recommend, go on a cheat day  have either the meatloaf or the fried chicken  and then the key lime pie is just amazing   best key lime pie i ve easily had on the west coast   kevin rose   we didn t have the pie   tim ferriss   we didn t because it wasn t my cheat day  but we started about watchville, and watchville is so attractive to me for a handful of reasons, and maybe not the obvious ones  so i don t currently wear a wristwatch   kevin rose   you don t wear anything, no rings   cock ring   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   just a cock ring  cock ring and butt plug all day long  working on my kegels, kegels   kevin rose   those aren t visible though, so those don t really count   tim ferriss   no, no, i m working up to the hand rings  so we were talking about it, and what i really like about this is the fact that it disproves i think a disabling belief that a lot of entrepreneurs have, or wouldbe entrepreneurs, like,  oh, well, everything s been done  uber for whatever has been done, and there s nothing left   and it s like no, there s so much left   kevin rose   yeah, the long tail is left   tim ferriss   yeah, and you found my favorite kind of market, which is a very precisely defined, easy to   relatively easy to target price insensitive high end market  and there s so much potential there  and you can make a lot of mistakes  there s a certain like margin of safety  if you have really good tech jobs, really good design jobs, and neither of those have been brought to that world, and it s such an attractive way to go   kevin rose   well, yeah, that s what i was going to say  one of the pieces i ll add on top of that, that i absolutely believe in is like if you re going to do something, if you re going to build something, there s a great book out there  peter teal put it out, called zero to one   tim ferriss   yeah, it s right over here   kevin rose   have you read it?  tim ferriss   yeah, absolutely   kevin rose   so zero to one, he talks about if you re going to build something, make sure it s an order of magnitude better than what s already else out there  and if you look at all the other watch apps out there, they are just    tim ferriss   what already else is out there? that was amazing   kevin rose   is that  inaudible  or no?  tim ferriss   no, but i get you   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin rose   so you look at everything else out there, and it was all crap  i went in and i investigated because first of all, i m not going to build an app if there s something amazing out there, right  so, you know, honestly, there was like a couple little watch apps here and there  i put this out there, and it was like tens of thousands of people flocked to it, and it s been like five days old  and you know, hundreds of thousands of sessions, and it just goes to show you like if you build a quality product, like the niche   like people will   they re begging for an android version  it s just insane  so i m pretty happy about it  but for other people that are out there, like to your point, like there s just so much opportunity in this like long tail of stuff that no one is touching  no one has built an app for like high end, like these collectors of nike shoes, air jordans  they paid like  5000 00 for a pair of shoes  it could be anything   tim ferriss   or whatever, it could be high end hats, high end    kevin rose   well, it doesn't even have to be high end  it could be like you know, there s gardening apps   tim ferriss   the point is   and i think also people get so obsessed with venture backed startups, they don t stop to consider alternatives to the traditional sort of venture backed game  it s like you don t need to have an ipo, a huge acquisition to build a massively successful company  i mean you can be privately held  i think mars company is still family owned  you can build massive companies, or at least very highly profitable companies  you don t have to get caught up in all of the echo chamber and romanticizing of silicon valley  i think it s really dangerous and unnecessary  but we ll come back to that  i wanted to talk about just the setting for a second  so this is my house  and we are sitting at my living room table, i guess you would call it  and these are the books that were on the table  i didn t add anything new, and i have stacks of books everywhere in the house, which some people dislike, but it s kind of my way of organizing things  so first i wanted to just give a congrats  this is a new book  you might recognize the name  so this is a startup that i advised, refinery 29  they re the largest independently owned fashion site, and it s massive  and they just came out with a book called style stalking, probably best suited to the women out there   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    but it s really about developing a distinct personal style  and this hit the new york times best seller list  so they sent me a copy to check out, and i can certainly use all of the help i can help  kevin rose   they re trying to tell you something   tim ferriss   so a lot of these books otherwise, on this table right now are related to illustrations  so i wanted to just point out a few of them  this one is robert e  mcginnis, and this guy is amazing as an illustrator  he has done everything from the movie posters for breakfast at tiffany s, to the james bond movie posters, to   he s know as the king of  inaudible  illustration   kevin rose   can i see this?  tim ferriss   yeah, absolutely  and they re so incredibly detailed and good  and i think they re discounted  the artistic value of what mcginnis did is discounted in the same way that sometimes norman rockwell s is discounted, because of how commercially successful it was  and speaking of rockwell, this is another one for those of you who might be interested  this is power magazine  this is one of my heroes, dimitri klokov, for those of you    kevin rose   let me see   tim ferriss   this guy is a beast  but j c  leyendecker, a lot of you may not know j c  leyendecker  he was one of the primary influences on norman rockwell  and you can see his art is just stunning  and if you look at the brush work and the strokes, it s very elegant  there is not an extraneous line to be found  so some of you who go a ways back with me know that i fantasized for a long time about being a penciler, comic book penciler for about ten years  so i ve been getting back into exploring that  so charles gibson   this is the gibson girl  it s been relatively easy for me to draw men for a very, very long time  so i was a comic book nerd and got really good at that  but the female figure is sometimes difficult, especially if you re trying to draw a female figure that is not an exaggerated anime type figure with a waist that s that big, and breasts the size of this room and so on  if you re trying to do something slightly more realistic, then this is just a fantastic guideline  a couple of others, and then i ll come  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    back to the thread of the rest of our conversation  these are two very different books  this is really dorky, but i love this stuff  many of you will know, really into stoic philosophy, this is just epicureans and stoics, edited by the axios institute  it s pretty good  it wouldn t get my highest recommendations  and then the last book i ll mention on the table is a new one  this is actually by a friend of mine, alex day, the underground storyteller, which is really cool  it s one of these rare books, experiential books that i enjoy  and i get sent a lot of books, and most of them are just not that good, quite frankly  this is about alex trying to ride every line and get off at every stop on the tube in london, and tell the history of each of those lines as he goes through it  it s fascinating  kevin rose   that s pretty cool   tim ferriss   so so far, it s very, very good  and then just a real quick, on the background here, every book here, as daria pointed out, nothing here is accidental  i m very anal retentive and ocd  every one of these books, because this is where i look for a lot of my day, has been placed very particularly to illicit a particular response from me  so you have vagabonding facing out, you have bird by bird facing out, zorba the greek, musashi, dune, the magic of thinking big, and a handful of others   kevin rose   what s the magic of thinking big?  tim ferriss   the magic of thinking big by david schwartz, it s an amazing book  i find that when people are failing to accomplish their goals, or generally suffering from a malaise in life, it s oftentimes because their goals aren t big enough  their dreams aren t exciting enough to them  and the magic of thinking big was recommended to me by stephen key, who has made millions of dollars creating different products and toys, and licensing them to disney, nestle, huge companies, hasbro, whoever it might be  and it was recommended to him by a number of fortune 500 ceos  and it s a super simple book, really inspiring  i ve had it for many, many years  that copy is probably at least 15 years old  and i think the externalities of lie are sometimes under appreciated  so for me, my external environment represents my internal environment  so if things are relatively neat, which i would say my house is right now, my mind tends to be well organized  if my  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    external environment s a mess, then my head is usually a mess, my thinking is a mess  so that s where we are  kevin rose   yeah, i would say the same way, like if you look at   i picture it as if you take your house and you rip the roof off, and you look down from like a bird s eye view, if you see just like chaos and mess everywhere like that, that s a reflection of basically my brain  like i feel when my office is like messy, i feel   it s gives you anxiety, too  when you have a messy house, like you have like a little background anxiety running   tim ferriss   no, it s low grade anxiety that s persistent  you may not even notice it  so for me, when in doubt   this sounds funny   but when i m having personal or business stress of whatever   when in doubt, just tidy your shit up   kevin rose   you have a house cleaner, so let s get real   tim ferriss   i have a house cleaner for cleaning, but they don t organize my stuff   kevin rose   i mean they tidy up your books   tim ferriss   no, they don t   kevin rose   never?  tim ferriss   that s off limits  they re not allowed to touch my books   kevin rose   you are anal retentive   tim ferriss   no, i don t want people fucking around with the order of my books  so i do have people who   i mean the wood takes a lot of care and stuff, but i don t want to turn this into a fucking    kevin rose   how much care does your wood take? like really, it s like every day   tim ferriss   well, what i m talking about here   alright, i ve had lyme disease and i m on like a million drugs, so i ve been not partaking of the nectar of   the juice of life, this stuff   kevin rose   the will harlan juice   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   oh, god, this is just getting better and better   kevin rose   let s move on to the next item   tim ferriss   moving on, yeah, i m very particular about stacks of books   kevin rose   i brought you gifts   tim ferriss   oh, you brought me gifts   kevin rose   yes   tim ferriss   what have you got?  kevin rose   so the first gift i have for you, i want you to get a good smell of this  smell that  really pungent   tim ferriss   weird  what is that? fermented coffee beans?  kevin rose   so these coffee beans right here   you see how oily they are?  tim ferriss   yeah, very oily   kevin rose   so we ll put a link in your blog article to this   tim ferriss   my blog article?  kevin rose   i don t know  you have a blog  i don t have a blog  blogs are stupid   tim ferriss   how old are you?  kevin rose   so we ll put a link in your blog article to this little   so here s the deal  i m going to tell you people something  just listen  it s going to my head, too  i m going to tell everyone about this little place in tokyo  it s this little hidden coffee shop  my only ask is one thing  you have to understand that they don t speak english in there, and it s almost   so when you walk in there, there s no tourists  so when you re walking in, like just be   the best way i can put it is just be very polite  don t talk loud  don t come there with a big group  and just be on your best behavior  that s it  you don t have to dress up or anything like that  it s a coffee house  but they re very like old school  i go in there, there s this guy, he s probably    copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   what s it called?  kevin rose   what s it called? hatou  yeah, hatou  hatou coffee  so you go in this little alleyway, you go in this little coffee shop  and the only thing that you can tell this guy   he doesn t understand english  he s like,  what do you want?  and he hands you a menu and there s english menu or anything  and you say    tim ferriss   that must be really helpful   kevin rose   yeah, exactly  you say,  old beans   and the old beans   he s like,  old beans   and he goes   takes   is it racist to like say    tim ferriss   it s not racist  that s pretty accurate   kevin rose   i mean that s the way actually his accent   tim ferriss   no, it s not racist   kevin rose   i don t mean to like    tim ferriss   so chill out, internet   kevin rose   i don t mean to like   this is how the way he does it   tim ferriss   keep moving, keep moving   kevin rose   so anyway, he s like   to me, he s like,  takes 20 minutes   he didn t say it like that   tim ferriss   takes 20 minutes   kevin rose   yeah, exactly  and so   but actually worse than that  so literally, he sits there and we ll splice in a videogram that s on my instagram account  i did a hyperlapse of him   tim ferriss   what did you do, like 20 minute pour over?  kevin rose   twenty minutes for the pour over, dude  i m talking like this, going really slow  and he makes this amazing pour over of fermented coffee beans  and you know how   i mean talk about fermented foods for a second, like what you know about fermented foods in general   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   well, i mean fermented foods have a lot of benefits  it depends in part on the format of the food, so you can grind things, you can consume them whole, like say sauerkraut or kombucha have different beneficial bacteria, among other things   kevin rose   and sometimes it makes the ingredients bio available to you as well when the bacteria break down   tim ferriss   yeah, some of them, i mean they have certain k vitamins as well that can be   or some people believe are very, very important for many types of health  and so fermented foods have a major part in my life right now because i m repopulating my gut and my microbiome after a lot of doxycycline, which is a broad spectrum antibiotic   kevin rose   yeah, so anyway, i want you to repopulate your gut with some fermented coffee beans   tim ferriss   these are the old beans?  kevin rose   these are old beans, man   tim ferriss   what s the right way to brew coffee with these?  kevin rose   thirty three grams of coffee, and do it    tim ferriss   to what?  kevin rose   to 300   it s a lot   tim ferriss   no, no, 33 grams to like 100 grams of water?  kevin rose   no, to 250 milligrams of    tim ferriss   that bag won t last super long   kevin rose   that s two cups basically   tim ferriss   oh, nice, okay, cool  i m down   kevin rose   anyway, make it, enjoy it, ferment it  it s fermented already  i got you another gift   tim ferriss   thanks, alright   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin rose   next gift is   i was just in tokyo for those people that don t know  it was awesome   tim ferriss   do you know which part of tokyo the hatou is from? i ll put a link   we ll have a link to the actual place  there s a blog article for those of you might be getting some audio, is going to be at www fourhourblog com   kevin rose   so this   have you heard of this company?  tim ferriss   lisn?  kevin rose   yeah, lisn   tim ferriss   l i s n   kevin rose   yeah, so this is a small producer of like these little freaking sticks   tim ferriss   sophisticated incense for listeners by shoyedo incense company   kevin rose   so it s all organic  all of these smells are non chemical  they re all from plant derived  and look at all the different   this is

tubes of just that color   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   this is cool  this is fun   kevin rose   this is like a variety pack   tim ferriss   variety pack, yeah   kevin rose   no, it s pretty awesome though  i like the fact that they   it s not like bullshit ingredients, like the lady was    tim ferriss   it s not like arsenic   kevin rose   yeah, she was like,  listen, we don t use any like perfumes, like artificial perfumes or anything like that    tim ferriss   there we go  bam  thank you   kevin rose   yeah, so that s a   if you want to check it out    tim ferriss   so that s lisn, l i s n   kevin rose   yeah, l i s n  i know they have a website as well, so you can type in like lisn incense japan, or something like that, and it ll probably come up on the web   tim ferriss   oh, and then it gives you the ingredients, so continue is cinnamon and clove  selected scents by 100, offered by eight assortments  i don t know what that means  but  inaudible   okay, so we were talking about ice baths and baths  i wanted to give people a tip because those of you who follow my nonsensical self experiments and lack of self preservation may be familiar with my love of ice baths  and ice baths are a bit of a pain in the ass, just logistically to organize   darya   and literally?  tim ferriss   and literally a pain in the balls, if they don t get to your throat within the first 30 seconds  and going to say, safeway, or wherever it might be, a gas station, to get ice, is a real pain in the ass  it s a real hassle  and i found    kevin rose   i think he s going with this   tim ferriss   i m going   i have a punch line, which is i ve never really used instacart, and i started using instacart for ice  and they will deliver 5, 10, or 20 pound bags of ice   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin rose   that s the weirdest fucking  inaudible  dude   tim ferriss   and so i can use instacart, pow, one click    kevin rose   you know that like that tim ferriss ordered 50 pounds of ice?  tim ferriss     and get 80 pounds of ice delivered by instacart like that  it is amazing  it s been such a game changer for me  so instacart, thank you for that   kevin rose   can you see the smoke in the camera? it s ridiculous   tim ferriss   this is amazing, yeah, yeah  this is not for enclosed areas  oh, my god, stop, drop and roll  i feel so continued  so that s my tip for the ice bath  we were talking about a couple things   kevin rose   what does the ice bath do?  tim ferriss   the ice bath is great for hormones like adiponectin for instance  if you want to increase fat loss,  inaudible    kevin rose   you put them around your neck and stuff, you said in your book   tim ferriss   yeah, if you want to go lightweight, sort of limpress style, if you want to go like burly, then you do an ice bath  and the way that i ve done it historically is typically in a normal sized ice bath, i ll be using 15 to 20 pounds of ice  i will only sit in ice up to about lower nipple area  and i will read a book for about ten minutes, and then and only then will i go down    kevin rose   reading fast   tim ferriss     to the neck, hands out, for another five minutes   kevin rose   why hands out?  tim ferriss   because you have a very high capillary density in your hands and your feet, and if you put your hands in, you re not going to last even 50 percent that long  so keeping the hands out is very helpful  you look a little   i guess, what, anchorman   kevin rose   no, talladega nights   tim ferriss   but that s how i generally go about it  i m not a doctor  i don t play one on the internet  if you have a heart condition, blah, blah,  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    blah, your head might explode  be careful, talk to your doctor  all right  this   we were looking at this earlier  so this is one of my favorite axes  and for those of you who   kevin rose   who even has more than one ax? like most people are like,  i have an ax, and i chop wood with it    tim ferriss   yeah, i have five    kevin rose   you have like death axes   tim ferriss   i do  look at this   kevin rose   that s like  that s for killing people  you don t chop wood with that   tim ferriss   well, i mean i would say that any ax could probably be used for killing people  now i do chop wood with this  but as it turns out    kevin rose   when do you chop wood? you don t have fucking wood in your back yard?  tim ferriss   i have wood right here, man  it s too large for my very, very lilliputian fireplace   kevin rose   where do you chop it?  tim ferriss   out on my patio, which makes people feel unsafe in my neighborhood because it s very loud  but   so this is a sog ax, and sog is an interesting company  they make a lot of multi tools and knives and whatnot  i have experimented with throwing axes because that s the type of thing i do in my spare time  and it turns out most throwing axes are very chintzy  they re made very poorly and they break when you throw them  and by the way, having an ax and like rebound at you in five pieces is rather dangerous  so this ax, on the other hand, is very, very sturdy  i believe it was modeled after an ax that was used by gis in vietnam, and it s fantastic for throwing  of course, that s not what i recommend because you might look at the back side of this  on the drawback, you don t want to spike yourself in the face, so don t do that  and just for you urban dwellers, i would also note that if you happen to be an american history ax looking guy like me, and you  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    go to the park to throw axes to practice, you might have the police called on you  kevin rose   did that happen to you?  tim ferriss   no  if you have a girlfriend or lady friend who s willing to just like come along so you don t look like a psycho, and just like a stupid boyfriend, then i would encourage you to take that  inaudible   but the sog ax is a winner   kevin rose   it feels like a good ax   tim ferriss   it s solid  it is solid  in other news, big announcement to make   kevin and i are getting married  no, we re not getting married  i am on instagram  i put up regular semi nude shots of me in my underwear   kevin rose   this wine has gone straight to your head  i love it   tim ferriss   that s what i reserve for snapchat, it s very exciting  but instagram com timferriss, two rs, two ss  and the first photo ever that i put up is of tony robbins, who is like eight foot seven, palming my entire head because his hand is large enough to palm my entire head   kevin rose   and he s on your audio podcast   tim ferriss   he is on my audio podcast  anthony robbins is on my audio podcast on the internet   kevin rose    inaudible  on that one   tim ferriss   that s true  i don t have anyone  but yeah, tony robbins is one of many interesting folks  i had peter teal   kevin rose   i was your first   tim ferriss   you were my first guest   kevin rose   don t think i don t remember   tim ferriss   yeah, i appreciate that buddy  and it s gone really well  the podcast has been a lot of fun, in fact, and that s where i m focusing a lot of my energy because i want to have not just well known people, but just like niche obsessive   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin rose   who s your niche iest that you ve got   your obsessive niche iest person?  tim ferriss   obsessive niche iest person   kevin rose   you ve had daria on the show   darya   oh, no, i thought you meant like people who like really niche audience   kevin rose   no, i mean like have you had any of those people on that you consider to be really niche y?  tim ferriss   i have, i think, in niche subjects, i had   the latest episode is a guy named nick ganju  you probably don t know  he s cto zocdoc, and co founder of zocdoc  and he s really, really good at explaining making non engineers or non mathematically inclined people comfortable with computer science and math  he s really good at   and i was turned off of math in tenth grade by a teacher who just busted my balls  it was a real pain  so i was turned off of math at   in grade ten  but nick is one of the most recent  i m going to have   and this is already recorded   the resident technology futurist for the fbi is going to be   is on the podcast   kevin rose   that s pretty cool   tim ferriss   it s recorded  it s just not published yet  and we talk about    kevin rose   oh, i ve got a guest for you  i ve got a great guest for you   tim ferriss   who do you have?  kevin rose   the iron sheik   tim ferriss   iron sheik?  kevin rose   yeah, he freaking dings me all the time  he s like,  i want to be on the podcast    tim ferriss   really? oh, my gosh   kevin rose   he s launching a documentary   tim ferriss   that could be amazing   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin rose   he s launching a documentary in like two months, and he s like he s coming to la, and he wants to do as much media as possible   tim ferriss   but he lives in jersey or something   kevin rose   yeah, yeah, like the iron sheik would be on your podcast, dude   tim ferriss   that could be amazing  so if you have any suggestions for podcast guests, please let me know  twitter is a good idea  that s the easiest place  it is  f e r r i s s  i m pretty sick of tech   kevin rose   you re tired of tech  yeah, you said you were tired of tech, like you ve been talking about tired of tech for a long time   tim ferriss   well, now, in full disclosure, since we re having a confessional here, you ve said the same thing to me   kevin rose   yeah, well, i hate tech   tim ferriss   right, so sometimes we respond via text at various moments randomly with,  god, i hate tech  i hate tech  fuck i hate tech   and there are various reasons for this  partially, you can t get away from fucking tech in san francisco  it s like you want to have a normal conversation about something else, and then someone   just like with   and by the way, everybody in silicon valley, just because you re a dick doesn t mean you have asperger s  you can t blame being an asshole on having some condition you ve never been diagnosed as having   kevin rose   dude, i literally had a phone call today with this lady from cnet, and she s writing an article  and she was like,  i want to tell you about wearable tech, and where you think it s going   and i was just like,  i m so tired of talking about this   and she s like,  well, what s the future like with the iwatch?  and i m like what s going on, and i m just like,  listen, i don t need any more tech  i m teched out   like i don t need any more notifications on my wrist and all that  and she s like,  oh, sounds like you re getting old, or whatever   i m like   i think tab browsing was the worst thing ever invented  i think we might look back in like 100 years and be like tab browsing was a bad idea, and like just lock it to one tab because dude, have you ever gone off and like spent like   i literally   like  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    this happens to me once a week  i ll be like 20 tabs deep, and i ll come back to tab one, and i ll be like  oh, that was that email i didn t click send on that this person wanted like four hours ago   tim ferriss   yeah, i have that right now  and chrome is going at like 1997 dial up speed because chrome has like 30 tabs open   kevin rose   right, and multiple windows with other tabs behind them  and she was like,  wearables, like watches   and i m like,  what is it going to give me, like a notification?  inaudible  do  i got that on my phone  it s in my pocket  what else is it going to give me, like your heart rate s at this? like, great  that s great, i m working out    tim ferriss   i do that   kevin rose   i don t think we sound old, but anyway   tim ferriss   no, you don t sound old  i think tech   and by saying tech, i m going to take a three to four month break on almost all angel investing   kevin rose   you re all about the breaks this year  you didn t masturbate for like two weeks   a month   tim ferriss   month   kevin rose   how d that go?  tim ferriss   oh, yeah, you lost the debate on booze   kevin rose   hey, how was the return to that? i bet you had a great session coming back in   tim ferriss   had like some makeup jerking   kevin rose   you re like,  i haven t seen you in a while    tim ferriss   you know, i got to say, it was pretty exciting   kevin rose   special   tim ferriss   yeah, it was exciting  so the   but the reasons are multifold  number one   and you ve seen this  going back to watchville, and tiny, is building stuff  and i feel like i can t   i don t have maximum excitement   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and i can t be of maximal help to the startups that i m working with if i m not on the cutting edge  and the only way that i m on the cutting edge is by building my own stuff, you know, and being out on the playing field by battling it and punting the ball down the field  so i m having a blast  kevin rose   you don t want to punt   tim ferriss   fucking homerunning it, field    kevin rose   just throwing touchdowns  punting is like when you re in a bad situation, and you ve got to kick   tim ferriss   yeah, i was going kind of world cup, but i hear you   kevin rose   okay   tim ferriss   so that s one reason  the second reason is i feel like the general coaching in the startup world   and we re not going to take too much time on this   has gotten to a point where everyone is reading from the same pitch script, so you just get   like i get so many bad pitches from people who feel entitled  and i think that s a dangerous sign, sort of a hubristic sign   kevin rose   so do you think there s a bubble going on right now?  tim ferriss   yeah, i do, i think   kevin rose   but it s not going to hurt anyone when it pops   tim ferriss   that s not true   kevin rose   who s it going to hurt?  tim ferriss   it s going to hurt the people who are getting way too much money with crazy terms, with bad businesses   kevin rose   well, it won t hurt them  they ll just go out of business and they ll move on to their next thing, right?  tim ferriss   well, i mean that would   it would hurt them and the people who have invested in them potentially  now i think there s great opportunity for companies that are say, in a space with three to five leaders  and there s one company that sees the writing on the wall, raises a bunch of money, is very lean in their operation against  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    competitors who are not, and have really high costs, and lots of heads to feed  then i think there s a massive opportunity  so i m not going to stop investing all together, but i m going to pick a handful of shots over the next three or four months, and i m going to stop everything else  kevin rose   so let me ask you a question  there s a lot of people out there that are entrepreneurs, that are wanting to start a business potentially  what is it that you look for then, like what is it   i mean you said already lean, but like in the pitch, when someone sits down with you, and they re like i have this idea, like what is it that you look for in the founder, their body language, the type of pitch? you said you re getting tired of seeing the same old thing  how can someone stand out?  tim ferriss   the way that people can stand out, number one, is don t be in such a fucking rush  and i m so tired of getting the like,  we re oversubscribed, but if anyone would get this, we think it s you, and we re growing 30 percent month over month   and i m like,  oh, really, like search and replace  it s the same email i ve had from ten startups this week   and they re like,  we re closing next 48 hours  we could squeeze you in for 25k   fuck off, like that   if i m really a good fit for the company, there s no overnight rush  do you know what i mean? and all of the best companies that i ve worked with    kevin rose   do they explain to you why? do they say tim, you could help us with x, y, and z, and we think    tim ferriss   no, it s just a bluff  it s a bluff   kevin rose   no, i mean when a good pitch comes in, is it like    tim ferriss   oh, when a good pitch comes in, they ve done their homework  they know exactly how things fit together   kevin rose   so what do they say to you? do they say this is why you re a great investor? do they kind of spell it out for you?  tim ferriss   they would say,  we re familiar with how you ve done a, b, and c  we think that we re different  we know you re interested in this  we re different because of a, b  and we d love to do something with you  there s no huge rush, but we might   we re probably closing around in the next x period of time   and they  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    don t give me 48 hours notice  they give me like two or three months notice  kevin rose   right, because you re the kind of person that likes to think on things a little bit, spend a week doing your own due diligence   tim ferriss   yeah, i like to think on it and do due diligence for myself and anyone who might be backing me on say, like angel list, where i do most of my stuff now  angel  inaudible  forward slash tim   kevin rose   i think i m slash kevin   tim ferriss   yeah, i think you re slash kevin  so that s where i do most of my stuff, and you can see all my investments there  but the best companies want a good fit, and they want the right investors  they don t want dumb money with the stupidest terms  do you know what i mean?  kevin rose   uh huh   tim ferriss   and that shows a longer term vision  i also, in terms of founders, and i don t want to turn this into a i hate tech, let s talk about tech for an hour  but since you asked the question, the best founders are not arrogant  they re just not  the ones that i interact with, at least   and i m sure there are exceptions   but in their interactions with me, they re not going to be immediately arrogant and entitled and prick ish  and i just see a lot of that right now  and there is so much money flooding the market  there s an oversupply of money, and undersupply of really good talent  and it s impossible for me to foresee in the next two to three years, there isn t a major correction because it doesn't take a million people   ten million people to believe there s a bubble for there to be a bubble  it takes a handful of hedge fund managers to liquidate 20 to 30 percent of their tech holdings  that s it  and all that takes is a string of bad ipos, a string of really high profile catastrophes of some other nature, that s it  so for me, the smart people, as entrepreneurs, and the smart as investors, are budgeting for that  but at the end of the day, i am having so much fun building  and it s been so long since i ve    kevin rose   what s your next thing? everyone like, you know, they    copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   yeah, you know, i am not sure what my next thing is  i am trying to be comfortable in that in between space because historically i ve always wanted that one thing, and it s helpful to have that because i m   it s easy to drown in the cool stuff, meaning   a friend of mine, derek sivers has said, and he s also written about this  your decision should be hell yes, or no  like if it isn t like hell yes, fuck yeah, i want to do that, or no  where you get killed, and i think where i ve been killing myself is like,  oh, that s pretty cool, yeah, sure, i ll do that   like oh, somebody asks a favor, like,  oh, that s kind of cool  yeah, sure, i ll do that   and you commit to ten of those, you re really stressed out  you don t have a lot of time  and you re not doing anything that you re really super 10out of 10 psyched about  so for me, right now, i m dialing back on a lot of things, and saying no to the startup investing for three to four months because i m not a momentum trader, right  i m not in it for the next six months like a lot of the fair weather angel investors out there  i ve been doing this for whatever, seven years, eight years  i m going to be doing it for the next 10, 15, 20 years  i can wait three to four months  i think that if there are   you know, people throw these number out  there are 15 or 13, or 23 kind of billion dollar plus companies that come through silicon valley every year  you don t need to get every one of those  you don t even need to get one of those every year  you hit   you get one awesome bet every year or two as an individual investor, with a fund that i don t have allocate over a set period of time, you re great  you re ahead of 99 percent of the people out there   kevin rose   so the people are out there and they want to get involved, i mean angel list is probably your best bet for going out? i would say so, as far as going out and finding    tim ferriss   i think angel list is a great way to find good investors  i think it s a great way to find good companies  and of course, i may be biased  i m an advisor to angel list itself, but i think   i ve never seen anything like it  i mean i just closed a  1 5 million round for a company called md insider, and the whole thing was allocated in one day  and it just simplifies the whole process   kevin rose   the one other thing i ve had, is i ve had people that have come up to me and said like you know, i don t have the money to angel invest, like how do i get involved in the tech phenomenon that s  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    going on? and i always have the same recommendation  it s like if you have something that you re really good at, like you re the best at   you know, i m good at marketing, or i m good at social media, or whatever it may be that is your thing, like just go after these young startups that don t have that person, and offer your services  i have a guy right now that s helping me out with customer service  he s awesome, this guy forrest  he s amazing  and he was like   he approached me, and he s like,  listen, i ll work for free if you want, like what do you want?  and he just wants a foot in the door, some stock options eventually, like that kind of thing  and it s like if you have a skill out there, and you don t have the funds to go out and be your own angel investor, there s still ways for you to get involved in these companies very early on  and i mean that s how you hear about these stories  there s a reason why the secretaries at microsoft were all multi millionaires  that was like a huge story that came out back in the nineties  it s like there s other ways for you get involved  it doesn't have to be through big checks  tim ferriss   yeah, i think that s very good advice  and angel list is actually   i just saw an article  it was  how i got 30 consulting gigs in 30 days using angel list   there was a piece about it  and i think this is a very smart approach  so for instance, if you were to not try to sign on immediately for a full time job, but do contract work for a half a dozen or a dozen fast growing companies    kevin rose   this is what david prager does  he goes out and he shoots videos for them   tim ferriss   this is a mutual friend of ours   kevin rose   yeah, i mean he used to be on revision three and some of the other stuff i did  but he went out and he shoots these videos  he started videos for companies, and if there s a really cool company, he ll say like,  you know what, i ll reduce your rates, but just give me some advisory shares   it s the same idea that the guy from facebook that painted all the murals, made like  250 million, something crazy because he took all stock from zuckerberg when he was painting their murals in their office  so anyway, that s kind of where you were going, right?  tim ferriss   yeah, that s where i was going  and then what you can do is when you do an amazing bang up job for half a dozen startups, and let s  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    just say four of them are like,  you know, we d love to hire you on a more ongoing basis,  then you can take a look at those people who are hot to trot, and ask for advisory shares or equity, or maybe even pull   you know, choose a full time gig, which is what i advised a very young guy to do not long ago  he actually had   he wanted to work with me, or he had a couple of other options  and one of them was stripe  and this was quite a while ago  and i said,  take the stripe job   and i was like,  they like you  take the stripe job, like that s a good horse to bet on   and he s pretty happy with it at the moment  kevin rose   that s awesome   tim ferriss   but what else is happening?  kevin rose   yeah, so this is like my last thing i have to talk about and we can wrap up or i m sure you probably have something else, but this book a buddy of mine recommended to me  i have not read it  i brought it along because i just got it in the mail and it was in my bag anyway  but i figured i d ask you   no, no, no, honestly, i was going to ask you if you had ever heard of it   tim ferriss   i ve read it multiple times   kevin rose   yeah, and so then you said you ve read it multiple times, and i m like,  well, maybe you should talk about it because i m about to read this   what am i about to get myself into? and daria just finished it   my wife just finished this book a couple days ago, right?  darya   because rahmet sayte is on your podcast   recommended it on your podcast, i m pretty sure   tim ferriss   yeah, that sounds right  so this is influence  the psychology of persuasion by robert b  cialdini  a lot of people say it that way, cialdini, right, it s a ch, italian fellow, phd  so the cover quote is  for marketers, it s among the most important books written in the last ten years   and it s a fascinating look at the psychological dynamics that companies and people use in selling services or products  how those can be used against you, how you can implement those for good in your own company, and it touches on things like scarcity, time restrictions, social proof, etcetera   kevin rose   i can t wait to read this  i m really excited   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   and it offers what i think is a very helpful checklist for any type of product launch or say, message or copy editing  so if you have copy and you    kevin rose   oh, you must have loved this   tim ferriss      inaudible  on a home page, then   or you re making an offer, or you re doing a product launch, or you re doing an email sequence for whatever, or even implementing facebook ads or something like that, i think that this offers a very good checklist for the components that lead to compelling offers   kevin rose   you just finished this book two days ago  is there anything you want to add to that, like anything that you took away from the book?  darya   it s also   i mean that s all absolutely true  it s also really interesting just in terms of human psychology because it s important to remember that people have a lot of different motivations for doing things, and it really goes through the basis of understanding how to get people to act  and when you re in my space, or any   i mean it s for marketing, yeah, but also like i just want to get people to eat healthy  and it s like for that, it s incredibly valuable   kevin rose   cool  i m excited  i can t wait   tim ferriss   no, it s a   i think a very helpful book  it s a seminal book that s influenced many other books, and whether you re looking at mystery and the mystery method for pickup artists, or you re looking at how   let s say, why common air companies are coached to pitch investors, or you look at how to get people to change their diet when they ve resisted it for 20 years, they all   all of the dynamics   the psychological dynamics that make any of those things successful boil down to a handful a principles, which in general are covered in this book  so this is not necessarily industry specific, which makes it very valuable because you can apply it wherever you want to   kevin rose   cool  that s all i got  anything else?  tim ferriss   you know, i don t   kevin rose   chop some wood?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   i don t think so  yeah, i got some almond wood, which is good for burning   kevin rose   what are you doing for thanksgiving?  tim ferriss   good for cooking   kevin rose   we re about to go into thanksgiving   tim ferriss   we are moving into thanksgiving   kevin rose   i m smoking a turkey   tim ferriss   i ll be headed to the east coast to have thanksgiving with my family   kevin rose   awesome   tim ferriss   which i m very excited about  i have a new wood stove coming in from vermont castings  did a bunch of homework  there are a number of really good companies out there, but decided on that  and i m excited for a little bit of brisk cold on the east coast  i don t like to live in the cold all the time, but    kevin rose   i know what you mean  i was just in new york a few days ago, and it was like it was nice   tim ferriss   yeah, it s crisp  it wakes you up  it s nice   kevin rose   nipples get hard   tim ferriss   it s good, levels up the nipples, brings them to attention  so i like thanksgiving and christmas for that  i m very   just for nipples   nipple erections  but that s   i think on that note, really, i ve covered all the bases this time around   kevin rose   graham, anything to add before we go? happy thanksgiving   graham   have you guys seen the too many cooks?  tim ferriss   no   kevin rose   too many cooks, what is it?  graham   it s an adult swim thing aired at 4 00 a m  in the middle of the night, and it s this parody of old  80s tv shows where they have  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    the credits of the folks that are in the show, and like you know, like they ll be doing something, and they ll look up, and their name will be on the screen, and they ll like smile at the camera  but this is an 11 minute long parody of that, that slowly devolves into like a really interesting horror movie  and i think that you guys would enjoy it, so go check   like go watch it  tim ferriss   too many cooks   graham   too many cooks  the song will be   i apologize in advance  the song will be stuck in your head for weeks, but that was great   kevin rose   it aired at 4 00 a m ?  graham   it aired at 4 00 a m   kevin rose   and they were just like screw it, we re going to put it up   graham   immediately when it aired at 4 00 a m , it immediately went viral the next day   kevin rose   no way   graham   it s got over like two or three million views, and it s the creepiest, funniest, like amazing   you ve got to see it  it s really good   kevin rose   awesome  that s a great recommendation, yeah   tim ferriss   too many cooks, check it out  and happy thanksgiving everyone, even if you are not in  merica  be thankful  take the occasion of all the yanks eating their turkeys, or tofu made, textured vegetable protein, god knows what here in san francisco  and think of what you re grateful for  i m not trying to get too deepak chopra on you  i m just saying  i think it s common for   i think it s common for type a personalities   i don t know where i m going with this   type a personalities to be very focused on achievement, and it s easy to recognize that you ve done so much, you haven t taken any time to appreciate any of it  and i think for just general peace of mind and quality of life, it s really helpful to take some time, even if it s just a minute before meals, grace style, even if you re not religious, to be thankful, and make a list of those things  so   and in fact, there s a really cool type of meditation that is sometimes called gratitude meditation, or compassion meditation, closely related, that s very interesting   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    but we ll save that for another session  so happy thanksgiving, even if you re not in the united states of america  kevin rose   peace out  see you soon   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    "
124,129,129: Random Show ,"   hello, boys and girls  welcome to another episode of the tim ferriss show  this is a special episode with kevin rose, revisited  kevin is a very close friend of mine  he now lives in new york  he is a well known venture capitalist  he s an advisor to google ventures, also now ceo of hodinkee  he was formerly involved with watchville and is now in the luxury goods market that is being distermediated and disrupted with technology  very interesting fellow  and we often do a video show together called the random show, or we used to when we lived in san francisco together  but he s now in nyc, i am usually in sf and we have not done any of these shows so we decided to give audio a shot  please let us know if you enjoy this, and here we go, the random show with timbo and kev kev  hello, ladies and gentlemen  this is tim ferriss   kevin rose   and this is kevin rose  welcome to a brand new edition of the random show  happy 2016   tim ferriss   happy 2016  happy new year, man   kevin rose   yeah, same to you   tim ferriss   it s going to be an exciting year  i can feel it in my bones, my old man bones   kevin rose   what did you do?  tim ferriss   what did i do, in 2016 so far?  kevin rose   no, just like what did you do for new year s? i want to know where you were, what you did   tim ferriss   i decided to bring my parents and brother to the bahamas because they had last been 36 years ago when i was two years old, and had always reminisced and spoke of the bahamas fondly and pined  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    after returning  and i just decided   or observed   that none of us are getting any younger and decided to bring everybody here for christmas and new year s, which i'm in a very fortunate position to be able to do, of course  but what i realized, because this is the second time i've taken my family on a trip for christmas and new year s, is that when you set plans, say, early in the year or even halfway through the year, you get at least six months of anticipation and talking about it and dreaming about it, and brainstorming things you re going to do with your family  at least half the benefit is just being able to put it in the calendar and have the benefit of that anticipation  it s kind of like as a kid looking forward to christmas but you just have to schedule your own christmas, since generally as an adult you re not running down the stairs in your pjs to tear things open  that s what i did  what about yourself? kevin rose   i was just here in new york  it was pretty relaxing  for christmas, i actually went out to las vegas, of all places  my family is based out there  so i had my wife s family and my family get together at a resort, the red rock casino out there  we actually watched star wars and just kind of chilled, and had some good food  yeah, it was awesome   tim ferriss   do you have any particular routine or ritual just before new year s, or on new year s, or after new year s?  kevin rose   definitely every year we talk about new year s resolutions  i don t really stick to them but i definitely have that ritual of the very next morning, just starting things anew and trying to track what it is i'm trying to achieve this coming year  so i did that this year, as well  i've got another list   tim ferriss   of things you re not going to follow?  kevin rose   yeah, exactly  although, you know me  i have done a few things in the past  for example, i haven t had a soda  this marks my 16th year without having soda, which is kind of nice   tim ferriss   no kidding  i didn t know that, actually   kevin rose   you didn t know this?  tim ferriss   16  wow  that s great   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin rose   yeah, it was just one of those things  it was new year s 2000  everyone was sitting around and talking about their resolutions  i was like, i've kind of wanted to give up soda  it s one of those things where for me, it was something i would consume a couple times a day  back then, i would crack open a dr  pepper or a coke or whatever  i didn t do any of that diet crap  i just went full sugar, or i guess it would be full corn syrup, which is even worse  but i was doing that and i had to get off of it  it s like, gosh, i ve got to start really watching my health  this was kind of the first step in that direction  i gave it up, and i weaned myself off initially  the first few months were extremely difficult  i was able to do it by actually using a substitute  so for me, that was juice   tim ferriss   i was waiting for heroin or something   kevin rose   exactly  it was crank, and i just got really addicted  no, but seriously, i started doing juice  and juice would give me that kind of sugar high that i was used to getting from soda  still not ideal but then from there, i was able to slowly dilute my juice down and consume less sugar  listen, sugar addiction and soda addiction is a real thing   tim ferriss   no, i was just imagining you with a tee shirt on that says  dilute my juice    kevin rose   you need to start a tee shirt company   tim ferriss   i don t know why   kevin rose   it kills you   tim ferriss   yeah  i do  my buddies and i were talking  we were just kind of pulling these weird combinations of words that came up in conversation after a few glasses of wine  there was another one called journeyman palooka  the palooka   i should look this up   effectively, it s like the jimmy jones of professional wrestling  those guys with the real human names whose sole purpose is to get thrown around and destroyed by the guys who have the cool names like the rock  so someone who is sort of continually   here we go   a mediocre or inferior boxer   that s it  a palooka is a person, pa l o o k a, although there s u k a, also  it s the guy they bring into the training camp to make the champ feel good when he s training  so he just gets to body shot them and knock them down   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin rose   right, totally   tim ferriss   that s a palooka  so someone who is basically forever a career palooka is a journeyman palooka  not sure how we got onto that   kevin rose   you were going to create a tee shirt out of that   tim ferriss   yeah, i've been thinking about doing tee shirts for awhile  i've chatted with the guys at teespring, for instance, who are fantastic  i don t know why i haven t pulled the trigger  it s one of those things that i need to review  what i was going to say is for the last four or five years, the habit that i've gotten into before setting any type of resolutions is to do a complete review of the previous year  so i go through a couple of different things  i look over quotes that i've collected, for instance  i go through my entire ical, or calendar, week by week and i basically do an 80 20 analysis of my emotions  the emotional extremes  so the things i loved and the things i hated  i make a list of the things that i loved and the things that i hated and don t want to spend more time, energy, resources on  then i review two other journals, the five minute journal, which people have heard me talk about  and then the morning pages  i go through and i figure things out, or try to identify things like why haven t i followed certain resolutions and followed others  i realized if i looked back at, say, my resolutions for 2013 or 2014, i had no more startups  i also had no more interviews   kevin rose   you were serious about this  when you say startups, do you mean starting a startup, or you were actually talking about investing in startups, is that right?  tim ferriss   that s right  i was talking about no more investing in new startups  i was able to pull the trigger on that in this last year, 2015, and wrote a long post on all of the reasons for taking a startup vacation but why, in broader terms it s important to say no and how to go about doing it  but then you look at no interviews, no media interviews  i haven t been able to stick with that  so i'll sit down and i'll try to figure out, i know this isn t generally pleasant for me  i know it can backfire when you get misquoted  why do i continue to do media interviews?  kevin rose   but it s important for your relevance, though  you know that   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   but i'm not convinced it is, at this point  because i've spent so much energy putting out 600 plus blog posts, and writing, and putting out the podcasts, and so on  i feel like for me to justify spending an hour on the phone with someone when they re going to pull out one or two quotes, probably misquote me, and slide it into a big article   kevin rose   no doubt  you ve got to pick your poison   tim ferriss   i have to ask myself if that time would not be better spent doing something either i enjoy, which doesn t have to be productive, like binge watching archer, which i've been doing while on the island  it s so fantastic, oh, my god  or doing something like working on my own content because i feel like i get a better roi  so that s the type of review that i've been doing  as i'm reviewing, i'll also make a list based on the things that i loved in the last year, or other ideas of the fun stuff to schedule  because what i've realized about myself, and i think this is true for a lot of people, is that they don t pre schedule the fun stuff, like week long trips to abc, or pack trips, whatever it might be   and i have a list of stuff for 2016 that i'd like to do   the work or some type of frivolous bullshit like just sitting on social media will swell to fill the void  it will expand to fill that space  so that s sort of where i'm going  do you have anything in particular that you want to do, not just resolutions because we re going to talk about that, like behaviors  but any new types of trips or experiences?  kevin rose   a lot of that was this last year  at some point, my wife daria and i are going to have kids  we ve talked about this, tim  i think that you kind of want to prepare for that and get a lot of these experiences and things that you want to do while you re still young and kidless out of the way  so i've spent a lot of time trying to knock out that list, travel wise  so any time i can do something for work travel wise, i tend to tack on a couple extra days so that daria can go along with and we can have fun together as a couple  so for example, in a couple weeks i'm heading off to geneva, switzerland for a conference that i need to attend  i'll be there for three days, and then we re going three days early so we get a weekend time and make that a thing  make that a mini vacation  and then honestly, one of the things i did for the first time this last year that i will do again this year, is take a few days   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and typically, i do this with a holiday weekend where you have already baked in three days off  and add on a couple of days on top of that and get a full week and get a staycation, where you just stay at home and really focus on the stuff that you really, really want to do but never actually have time to do  i'm not talking about chores, but more just personal improvement stuff or things that every single week it gets pushed to the next week  tim ferriss   what are those things for you?  kevin rose   gosh, for me it s around organization and little, dumb things like cleaning off my desktop on my computer  that feels so good, you know? getting to inbox zero on one of my personal accounts  getting into the sauna, or starting something new  i'll talk about the wim hof method, which i know you ve interviewed him on your podcast  i'm now going into week four on that  that was something i started during my staycation   tim ferriss   very cool  i want to ask for some help from folks on a couple of things on my list  seven to ten day water only fast  i already did that, which i'll hopefully have some reports on for folks   kevin rose   did you talk about that anywhere on any of your other podcasts?  tim ferriss   no, i haven t really gone into detail  i did a ten day water only fast   kevin rose   we ve both done fasting in the past  the most i've ever done is a 24 hour fast  i did a juice fast of three days  just juice only i'm really curious  can you give us the quick little rundown of why and what it felt like?  tim ferriss   the rundown of why is easy  there s quite a bit of data in the scientific literature and just empirical from friends of mine who do a lot of work with fasting, a lot of which is unpublished at this point  but talking to people like dominic d agostino  dom d agostino, for anyone interested in fasting or preventing cancer, ketogenic diet  that s the podcast you want to listen to  we cover everything  it appears to be a very effective way to purge precancerous cells  so if you re over the age of, say, 35 or 40, i think the number i've heard is something like 70 percent of people have cancerous cells  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    that could become potentially problematic later  it s not so much of a problem that you have mutations that have caused cancerous cells  it s when they grow out of control or become malignant or metastasize that you get yourself into trouble  so fasting at this point my personal protocol is i'm trying to do one full day a week, intermittent fasting  i've been doing intermittent fasting for the last 14 days or so because the bahamas are not known for being slow carb or keto friendly  so i'm having rice for my evening meal but i m fasting until about 12 p m  or 1 p m  and then eating in a six to eight hour window  but the protocol, if we re looking at strict fasting, not the 12 to 18 hour fast, i'm looking at 24 hours a week, one three day fast a month and then one seven to ten day fast per quarter  i've actually only stuck to the longer fasts once every six months or so because you do pay a productivity penalty  the trick, if you re doing a longer fast like that, and you should never do it without medical supervision  ketoacidosis as a diabetic is not the only thing you would have to worry about  there are other things that can go sideways  so you really want to ensure that you have medical supervision if you re doing a longer fast of any type  i'm going to have some data to share on this but i really want to look through it all  based on dxa scans and bioimpedance and all sorts of stuff that i tracked, i didn t lose any muscle mass over what was effectively a nine and a half day fast  there are a bunch of tricks that you could use for that but one of the most important aspects of threading that needle is getting into ketosis, where your body is using body fat as fuel as opposed to glucose   blood sugar   is getting into ketosis as quickly as possible  because what a lot of folks will do is, say, juice fast or they ll just go full starvation and won t expedite the process of getting into ketosis  so they have three or four days where they are effectively eating muscle tissue  that s being broken down into amino acids that the liver then converts to glucose through something called gluconeogenesis  i'm doing a lot of experimentation with this  dom d agostino is the guy i rely on, so people should definitely listen to that podcast  as far as how i felt, i was able to work as much or as little as i wanted  i did light exercise   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    there were really only i would say, two days out of the nine where i was just a whiney little bitch who wasn t getting anything done  it was a good thing i set parameters for myself so that i wouldn t send off a bunch of really bitchy emails to people and create a mess for myself  kevin rose   i've done a handful of these fasts in the past and i will tell you i tried, like any rookie does when he first gets started with this stuff, i tried a juice fast as my first one  that was a horrible experience   tim ferriss   yeah, it s the worst   kevin rose   because you re right  you don t get into ketosis  i had to run to the bathroom   you probably know why   just because your gut just explodes into the toilet   tim ferriss   if you re consuming that much fruit juice, you just get disaster pants all day  it s terrible   kevin rose   it was really bad  but then, you were talking about it a little bit and i remember hugh jackman had an interview on 20 20 where they asked him how he gets so ripped to play the role of wolverine  he said,  the rock actually gave me his secret, and this sounds really silly but it was intermittent fasting   he said,  i intermittent fast  i go 16 hours fast every single day when i'm shooting the movie and then i eat for eight hours   that s what he did  so i started trying that  i probably did intermittent fasting, i would say, maybe two months out of last year  it gets you shredded quickly  so that was a lot of fun and it s a nice little kick in the pants to get you into ketosis faster  i'm excited to try  one of the other things that i saw that i don t know if you ve seen the study that came out here a couple of weeks ago, or maybe it was a month ago, was this thing called mimic fasting  have you heard of that?  tim ferriss   the fast mimicking diet  i want to say that s based on longo s research  why don't you explain for people what that is? i have some reservations about it but there are definitely people who are following this protocol   tim ferriss   there was a paper that came out about it that essentially, they talk about the really big benefits and i'm not talking about a flat stomach but more of the stuff that tim was talking about along the lines of anti cancer and some other things kicking in as you get into the longer duration fast so once you re day two, three, and on   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    it s really difficult, though, as anyone will tell you when you do these really long fasts  the idea was that they could mimic fasting by serving you things like really lightweight broths in soups  so you are still consuming some calories but it s not a ton  and you have a couple of these little, tiny, broth based meals per day  your body still goes into the fasting state but it s not as brutal as the traditional, full on just water fast  tim ferriss   i want to say it s less than 400 calories a day, or something like that   kevin rose   something like that, that s right   tim ferriss   i will say there are some data that would seem to indicate that pure fasting still exceeds the benefits of low or severe caloric constriction in terms of lowering igf 1, and so on  one could then debate whether lowering igf 1 in fact extends longevity in the same way that you could argue about whether lowering homocysteine decreases inflammation, and there s a lot of debate about both of those  that s the first thing on the list  i already knocked it off  i was going to do that in 2016 but i did it towards the end of 2015 and i'll do it again  one thing i'd love recommendations for from people listening is i'd like to create some short films  what i realized is i need to do more things just for the fuck of it  for instance, hiring people or paying creatives just to make cool shit, without any profit motive whatsoever  so i can find high endurance creatives to help make, for instance, short films   i eventually want to do some feature film stuff  when i was chatting with robert rodriguez, i got the idea   or maybe he gave me the idea   of making a few short films  and i think evan goldberg and seth rogen also said this, so that i could go from start to finish in a micro sense from drafting up the screenplay, so to speak, doing the storyboarding, working with a full team, director, etc  so i think that s something i'm going to do  make a couple of five to ten minute short films  and if anyone has any particular recommendations for that, i am all ears  so please just hit us up on twitter, hashtag random show  while we re at it, kevin, what s your twitter handle?  kevin rose     copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   and i am  because i'm an idiot other things that i would love recommendations on, i've never been to montreal and i've been dying to go to montreal  so if people have recommendations for when to go, what to do, hashtag random show, let me know, montreal  i'm focusing on bodyweight exercises and gymnastics training  there s a very interesting guy, i think it s chris somers with gymnastic bodies, which i follow on instagram  i've pinged a couple of my buddies  max shank is another one who s very interesting to check out  i want to focus on doing two moves, and you can google these because it s a bit of a hassle to visualize a planche  you know what, fuck it  i'll take a stab at describing it  so a planche pushup is where you re flat on your hands or on your fingertips, and your legs are spread  you re in a pushup position and your feet are off the ground  what that means is you have to lean forward so that your shoulders are way ahead of your hands  so i want to get to the point where i can do a comfortable planch or a planch pushup, and also something called a front lever, which is kind of almost the upside down version of a planch, in a way, but you re hanging from a bar and your body is completely parallel to the ground but you re levitating  and of course you re connected through your arms to the bar  so people have recommendations for any particular exercises that have helped them with quantum leaps in progress with either of those, hashtag random show  let me know  i would love to hear about it   kevin rose   i'm looking at the planch pushup right now  there s now way in hell you re going to pull this off  you re way too big   tim ferriss   i'm optimistic   kevin rose   it s like little tiny dudes doing this   tim ferriss   yeah, they tend to be a little small but there are beefier dudes who do it and i'm optimistic  so i'm going to give it a shot  i might have to cut off my legs at the knees or lose a lot of quadzilla size in my legs, but i'm optimistic  so i'm working on  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    that  it definitely does not help if you have a lot of extra weight in your legs to do either of those things  kevin rose   so is this one of your new year s resolutions or just something you want to do in general?  tim ferriss   i would say it s a new year s resolution  those are two movements i'd like to stick  i'd also like to get to the point where i can do a slow   i'm going to fuck up the terminology here and sorry for the cursing, guys  i got criticized because some people listen to these with their kids  but alas, from long island  i apologize  i'd like to be able to do a slow handstand from standing with legs together, knees locked where i just slowly go down to palms on the floor  and i guess that would be in the pipe position  just go straight up to a handstand and i can lower my feet down, tap the toes and come back up  i'd like to get to that point   kevin rose   that sounds doable   tim ferriss   it looks more doable than the planche, yes   kevin rose   i told you what i've been doing for my core strength, right? did i mention this to you, the pilates thing?  tim ferriss   no, you didn t mention it to me   kevin rose   it s been three months of pilates twice a week for me  you can laugh all you want   tim ferriss   no, i like pilates   kevin rose   hold on  let me explain  i hate you   tim ferriss   it s good for your pelvic floor  are you doing kegels?  kevin rose   you go to the gym, and i walk by the pilates studio and yes, it doesn t typically tend to be very many guys in there  it s kind of like core strength and all the guys are out there hitting the iron  i get that  but you know, i have always had a really crappy core  and for me as a guy, i feel a lot of guys are like this  i would say legs and core are two things that typically get overlooked  a lot of guys go to the gym, they hit upper body, they hit shoulders, they hit chest  so i always had a really weak core, and i knew that  i started to have some back issues this last year so i was like, now s the time to really get serious about my core  and  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    i did what anyone else would do  those leg lifts at the gym  and then i was just like, i m really not getting the results, this sucks  i don t feel motivated  it s the last thing i do  i always kind of do half the reps i want to do  and so i tried a pilates class  i didn t try the group class  i went to an instructor so i could get the full on experience  i found a semi reasonable instructor price wise and i go twice a week, and it s been amazing  i would say that i can do things with my abilities i never thought possible  granted, they re still not showing due to beer and pizza and things of that nature  tim ferriss   underneath the ripples of fat, you re shredded   kevin rose   underneath there is a ripped nine pack  seriously, though, it s a lot of fun because pilates is one of those things that if you have an instructor, there are so many exercises that it doesn t feel like you re doing the same thing every time  it s something like 30 different moves  so she s constantly changing it up, having me do different things  she started me at the correct pace where i wasn t killing myself but at the end of every session i'm definitely sweating and i just feel stronger  so it s been a fun practice for me to add into the tail end of last year   tim ferriss   i think pilates, the strict, classical pilates is fantastic  it s very similar in a lot of ways to gymnastics training, actually, with a tremendous amount of focus on pelvic tilt and becoming comfortable in different positions and understanding pelvic tilt, and then something called the transverse abdominis  so people can think of that as a corset muscle that runs horizontally across   this is simplified, obviously   but across your abdomen   and if you cough or laugh really hard and you get sore in the mid section, that s the transverse abdominis  when people have really lax or weak transverse abdominis, you notice a lot of things  and if they have tight hip flexures for a whole host of reasons like not sitting enough, not stretching the hip flexures, not having strong muscles around the pelvis, you see people who have low body fat but look fat when they re just standing there in clothing because they have the hips kind of pouring forward  that makes their gut stick out, and then they have a protruding belling because they have weak transverse abdominis  pilates is great for that  i get asked a lot by women, for instance, what should i do for exercise? i want to look like this person, look like that person   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and they point out very athletic dancers or celebrities, etc  inevitably, if they want to keep it simple   and this could apply for guys, too but i do get this question specifically from women a lot   it s pilates and two handed kettle bell swings  if you do pilates, very classical, technical, unforgiving pilates and kettle bell swings, and let s just say you did that twice a week, like monday, wednesday friday  monday and friday you do the kettle bell swings, wednesday you do the pilates or vise versa  you could alternate weeks, even  so it would be like pilates monday, kettle bell wednesday, pilates friday, kettle bells monday, that way  you can get in fantastic, incredible shape and all you would need to do is moderate carbohydrate consumption with something like slow carb or paleo or whatever  which i still think is, for a lot of people , more sustainable than intermittent fasting  i did light up the internet accidentally  i did a little bit of internet arson inadvertently because i put a post on facebook and twitter saying most people who do intermittent fasting are just getting smaller, not leaner  meaning they re losing muscle mass  that was based on data from a friend of mine who runs a dxa scan facility, which gives you a very good idea of exactly what s happening with your body composition  body fat and muscle  she said the vast majority of guys, and they do tend to be guys, who come in and do an experiment with intermittent fasting lose a lot of muscle mass  so they lose weight, they re looking at the scale, they think they re doing a good job and in fact they re backsliding because their body fat percentage is going up  the internet freaked out about that  but i think ultimately when you re looking at resolutions or making changes in the new year, the good plan that you all follow is better than the perfect plan you re going to quit in two weeks  so there you have it  another thing i would like feedback on from people is i'm considering doing live podcasts and traveling around the country  i'll probably do some tests in la first, and then san francisco and new york  and then i'm thinking about hitting a bunch of lesser known or lesser traveled places like montana, and going on a road trip and actually going around the country  what are your thoughts on that? you ve done more live shows than i have   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin rose   i've certainly done a lot of live shows back in the day with dig nation  when you say live, do you mean audience or no audience?  tim ferriss   i mean audience  i mean actually meeting people and just traveling around the country  i would obviously test this first in a few places where i'm comfortable and know i can fill seats like la, sf, new york  but then i'd be doing live audience for sure   kevin rose   it s chaotic  i think if you would hire a person or two to help out, to help manage some of the chaos, and then certainly very directional microphones so you don t pick up the entire crowd  it s a lot of fun and it s good to kind of vibe off the audience and feel the energy when they laugh at certain things you re talking about  you can always take live questions or things like that  why not? why not experiment? do it   tim ferriss   i think i'm going to do it in la, first in january or february, so that s coming up soon  so keep an eye out, folks  if you have any thoughts, let me know  if you have any thoughts on venues for like 500 to 2,000 people, and kevin, is there a sweet spot of audience size for you?  kevin rose   i've always enjoyed the slightly more intimate shows  when you get going into the bigger venues, typically they ask for more money and they charge  whereas you can go and find nice bars with a small stage that say hey, if you re going to fill this up with people, i'll just give you the space for free  like beach chalet out in san francisco is one of my favorite spots and we used to do shows out there   tim ferriss   beach chalet?  kevin rose   yeah, it s right out by ocean beach  they can hold probably 500 people  i just picked a slow night  do it on a monday or tuesday night or something and they ll just give you the space  they set up speakers for us and it was just completely free because they knew they would sell more beer   tim ferriss   cool  you mentioned an app to me that you were finding useful  i don t know if you want to hold that back for later but i'd like to hear more about it   kevin rose   absolutely  along with new year s resolutions comes the need to track all this stuff  you and i are both very kind of quantified people   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    last year, i tracked my alcohol consumption in a google spreadsheet, which was great  every single day i would color code it  i wrote a little script so that based on what i typed in, it would change it to either green, orange or red  tim ferriss   and just to be clear for folks, he was trying to beat 30 drinks a week  that was green   kevin rose   yes, i was trying to go for at least 50 to 60 drinks per week  no, it was really eye opening  because you tend to just think oh, i've got this even tonight, no big deal, let me go have three drinks  oh, there s an event two nights from now  my wife wants to crack a bottle open  and you don t realize not only how many drinks you re having but just the sheer amount of calories you re putting into your body in consuming all this alcohol  so it was eye opening for me  but it wasn t something that was easy to do on the go, especially when you start layering in other things  why don't we do this  i'll give you my quick, little 30 second rundown of all the stuff i'm trying to track  the name of the app that i'm using that i found is way of life  and i think by far it is the best habit tracking app out there  it s really simple to set up  it creates beautiful charts and graphs out of the data  you say yes, no, or i skipped it  you can set up things that are also negative  so for example, one of the things they have is did i drink over three drinks? so if i say yes to that, it will actually turn it red instead of green  so i'll give you my quick list  no  1   and these are not in any specific order   watch a ted talk every day  that s going to be easy  i subscribe to the ted video podcast on itunes and i'm going to watch one every single day for the entire year  sauna three times a week  i want to get serious about heat   tim ferriss   me, too  ditto   kevin rose   i've already done it three times this week  i'm going to skip today but i'm going to go tomorrow  i alternate a cold bath and sauna  i found a great place in new york  they have turkish and russian baths  the cold is extremely cold and i go in there, and i can talk about the wim hoff method later, what i'm doing to stay in there for long periods of time  the third one is two or less drinks  so i'm  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    trying every single day to consume two or less drinks  i'm tracking my pilates  i'm also tracking meditation  i'm tracking weight lifting  trying to do that three times per week  i'm tracking no alcohol, so those are days i take entirely off from drinking  i want to know how many days i'm doing that per month, and you can see month over month progress with this app  it s wonderful  i'm tracking no sugar  i'm tracking tea consumption  so out of the last seven days, i've had tea four days  no coffee  i am trying to do tea only for a few days  coffee has been a crutch for me for a very long time so i'm trying to slowly wean myself  i don t inherently think that coffee is bad for you  there is a little bit of data if you drink more than two cups, it can increase your homocysteine levels, which i have elevated but that could be because i have that mother fucking gene  you know what i'm talking about, the mthr? tim ferriss   mthfr gene, or some nonsense like that   kevin rose   so that could be why  and then also slow carb  i'm living the tim ferriss lifestyle   tim ferriss   living the vita ferriss   kevin rose   when i say slow carb, i tend to mean a little bit more on the keto side  obviously, that s also slow carb ish  i do a kind of modified keto that is a lot more veggie forward   tim ferriss   veggie forward? sounds like a wine  mmm, broccoli on the tongue   kevin rose   exactly  so that s everything i'm tracking and this app is phenomenal   tim ferriss   that is a lot to track, man  are you not worried that you re going to flame out because of too many variables? it seems like you spend a lot of your time inputting data   kevin rose   the beautiful thing about this app is it s not about typing a ton of notes  yes, there s a section for that but it s simply yes or no questions  like did you have alcohol today, and you tap yes or no  then it goes onto the next one  it s all done in a vertical list of things so you don t have to view any additional screens  seriously, it sends me a text every night at 10 p m  because i set that up in the app  then i go in there and it takes me all of, i'd say,  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    30 seconds to input all the data  and this is the fun thing  every first of the month, so come february 1st, i'm going to tweet out my results from last month  tim ferriss   that s smart   kevin rose   it creates a little, tiny spreadsheet for you that you can tweet out, like a little, tiny graphic  it s going to be fun   tim ferriss   yes, if you force yourself to do that  although now, people know so if you get to the second of the month, anybody listening, and you remember and you see that kevin hasn t put up his numbers, you can remind him on twitter   kevin rose   please remind me   tim ferriss   i wanted to underscore something here about resolutions and goals in general  behavioral change  that is if it s not in the calendar and if you don t have some type of consequence or stakes, you re not going to do it  for instance, i've seen a number of new year s resolutions lists online from fans  they often say i want to meditate more, i want to drink less alcohol  not only is that not specific enough, you want to make it measurable  you want to have some type of quantified goal  but there s no punishment or real reward for not following that behavior, if that makes sense  so two things  get it in the calendar  so if you say meditate more, and let s say you decide that means you re going to meditate three times a week for one minute in the morning, or five minutes in the morning or before bed, put it in the calendar or it will get crowded out  the second is have either an accountability partner, or put together a betting pool with a bunch of friends  i talk about this a lot in the four hour chef because it s about accelerated learning  i'm going to put up an excerpt from that chapter for free for people to check out  i'll put it at fourhourworkweek com stakes, like tent stake, s t ak e s  so fourhourworkweek com stakes and i'll put that up  but you need to have some type of reward or punishment  punishment generally beats out reward  i know that sounds funny but the prospect of losing, say,  100 in a betting pool will motivate you more than the possibility of winning  100  this has been very well researched  or some type of pubic embarrassment works very well, also  or being humiliated because you didn t live up to your side  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    of the bargain  like if kevin doesn t put out his numbers and then people give him a bunch of shit on february or march 2nd, that will be a motivator for kevin  kevin rose   it s a huge motivator  i m going to expose all of my drink data and everything else directly online, so i'm excited for that  the other thing i'll add on top of that is i was reading a post, i believe it was a study that was done that talks about when you re trying to form a new habit, try combining it with something you enjoy doing  have you heard this at all? so for example, if you re going to the gym and getting on the treadmill for the first time, bring your favorite new series, archer or whatever it may be, and put it on your ipad and watch that while you re working out  so you re doing something you enjoy  so for me, i get through serious treadmill sessions at insane inclines  tim ferriss   like 2 to 3 degrees?  kevin rose   oh yeah, right  i m talking like 8 plus degrees but really slow  and i'm just drenched in sweat but i'm playing a tower defense game that i love  so that s my time to game but also get my exercise  if you re going to meditate, do a shot of whiskey before  no, i'm just kidding  don t combine like that  actually, one thing i do do, if i can make it on a streak for three days in a row with no alcohol at all, i go to the kava bar and i have a full bowl of kava  it s amazing   tim ferriss   i know, you ve told me  i don t know enough about kava to know whether it s better or worse for you than going without alcohol for three days straight   kevin rose   let me give everyone the 30 second rundown on this  basically, there is an herb called kava  you can go to whole foods or any grocery store almost and buy it in a kind of tea form  actually, yogi tea makes one on amazon that has five star reviews  almost a solid five starts with 5,000 reviews  use a couple of those tea bags, soak it for 15 minutes and then drink it like tea  it puts you in a very relaxed state  it s almost like you ve had a couple glasses of champagne but without drinking  they actually have bars that are popping up over in new york that don t serve alcohol  they just serve kava  you co in and they give you a bowl full of kava  it tastes like dirt, and you just kind of down it   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and then within 15, 20 minutes you just feel like sinking into your chair and you re totally mellowed out  get it while it s legal  tim ferriss   a side note for folks, smoking like a hookah pipe is not risk free  you can down the equivalent of a pack of cigarettes very easily sitting at a hookah bar  so that is not without its risks  speaking of chilling out, i want to recommend that people consider picking up the practice of meditation because it is a very cumulatively powerful habit to begin  it doesn t have to be super woo hoo or new agey  i was looking at twitter yesterday, actually  we both have a friend, bobby goodlatte   is it goodlatte? is that how you say his last name?  kevin rose   it s just goodlot   tim ferriss   jesus christ  goodlot, i've never really known because i always hear just his first name  but resolutions for 2016, 1) stick to tim ferriss  excellent slow carb diet for as long as i can bear  he s used it before so it s not that hard  2) use headspace or meditate regularly  there are a couple of different approaches you could take for getting started with meditation  one was recommended to be by kamal ravikant, a very, very smart and good friend of mine  and it was very simple  this actually comes back to your gaming while you re on the treadmill  so people who don t want to meditate, pick a song that puts you in a good mood  for me, it was  i'm gonna party like it s 1999  by prince, because it s hard to take yourself too seriously or be in a bad mood with that song  you re simply going to sit on a cushion or on a couch with your back against the back of the couch or the wall  you re just going to focus on your breathing to the extent possible for one song  that s all you re going to do  you just get into the habit of doing that, and you do it just in the morning  once in the morning and it s, whatever it is  three minutes long  if you want to go a little bit further, and even people who meditate regularly without any tools use, for instance, headspace  you used headspace, didn t you?  kevin rose   yes, for a long time  i m actually doing wim hof s meditation stuff now but yeah, i love headspace  i was on the phone with my sister last night and she was looking to getting into meditation  the first thing i do is always recommend headspace  they have this  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    ten days for ten minutes a day  it s called the  take 10 challenge   if you get through those ten days, you ll be sold  it s amazing  tim ferriss   and to that point just broadly speaking, one of the things i do when i review my calendar for the year and i make my list of things that have had the greatest positive and negative emotional impacts over the year, and i look at them as categories, usually what i end up with is a set of challenges or things you d like to change in the following year  and one of the questions that i've tried to start asking is what if it were easy? what would that look like? so with meditation or working out, even the term working out is i think a disservice to a lot of people  because they go to the gym and they want to push themselves after doing, say, no exercise for six months  so they try to go to the gym for an hour a day for five days  they miss one of those days and they feel like a failure and then they quit  it s like, you re setting the bar too high  what would it look like if it were easy? one set of kettle bell swings twice a week  start there  or getting on the treadmill for five minutes, meditating for three minutes  because ultimately, it doesn t matter how effective something is, doesn t matter how efficient something it is  if you don t adhere to it, it doesn t work   kevin rose   another great one is just 10,000 steps a day with a fitbit  you can actually lose weight that way  i have people that have set these 10,000 step a day goals and just use the fitbit to track it   tim ferriss   absolutely  i think that it s important to realize, and i remember oprah winfrey said this at some point  she always said,  i always felt like if i weren t stressed out i wasn t trying hard enough   she doesn t feel that way anymore  and i've realized, especially after conversations with guys like derek sivers who has this story about biking, going for this bike circuit in i think it was santa monica  he would huff and puff and try to break his time record every day, and it was 43 minutes  he could never break 43 minutes  it was this long, ten mile track or whatever   i'm making up the distance but something like that  then one day, he s like  you know what, i'm bummed out  he started wanting to skip the ride because it was just too intense and wasn t enjoyable  he s like  i'm just going to cruise and enjoy myself this time  he took the same route and he came back and it was 45 minutes instead of 43  he s like, what? all that discomfort,  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    all of that grunting and groaning and just feeling miserable and the only gain was two minutes out of 45  that was the only improvement  i feel like for a lot of the things we do, whether that s managing investment, or exercise, or i have a list, here  i actually did this exercise a couple of days ago where it s like okay, podcast excerpts, audio books, book publication, body weight training, investing, getting entertainment guests on the podcast, crowdfunding, dog training, waking up early  like what if it were easy? what would that look like, and actually writing it out? and it s incredible how many problems you can solve just by not creating problems for yourself in complexity  what type of health goals do you have for 2016? any particular health goals or changes? kevin rose   i think in listening to and getting into rhonda patrick s podcast, the role of micro nutrients in our overall health is just fascinating to me  i had always been one of these guys who grabs a couple of slices of pizza and yes, tim, i did have some yesterday but that was my last day   tim ferriss   you say that every time   kevin rose   no, i'm serious  it was my cheat day, tim   tim ferriss   i never do this  oh, my god, i never do this   kevin rose   what i'm saying is in my head, i would rationalize it saying  well, i'm taking my multivitamin  and that just doesn t get the full spectrum  it doesn t really get what you need  and so in watching her podcast and understanding a little bit more about what we need to consume to be healthy, i've really upped my vegetable intake  so i'm doing a wide spectrum, wide range of colors in my vegetables and just having one massive salad per day  i've been doing that for a couple months, now  i certainly feel a lot better and my skin actually looks better, too  it s healthier   tim ferriss   you look pregnant  you have that glow   kevin rose   i have that glow about me   tim ferriss   so do i  it s kind of an oily sheen  i've been eating sardines every morning, having a can of wild planet sardines that i've talked about before   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    i will just tell people the way that i use it, and i think i've mentioned this once before, is i'm traveling  my dog doesn t like to eat dry kibble  yours doesn t, either  but if i bring the  origin,  is the type of kibble i brought  i don t use the  foul  for reasons i can explain another time  but i think it s the red label   it sounds like johnny walker   origin  i will open the can of sardines and then pour the oil on top o9f the kibble and then eat the sardines myself  kevin rose   that s awesome   tim ferriss   so molly, my dog, is getting the olive oil and the sardine juice  she was having some dry skin issues, like brittle hair issues and i couldn t pinpoint the issue  within three days of starting to add the sardine oil to just one meal a day, and i'm feeding her twice a day, perfect coat, skin, everything  completely fixed after three days  you have to assume on some level, being mammals as we are, that there s some type of corresponding effect in humans   kevin rose   absolutely   tim ferriss   i wanted to mention a book that i recently read that people might want to check out  i believe it was mentioned and recommended to me by one of the podcast guests i've had on because it was on this running list of books to pick up  it s called happy money  the science of happier spending  the authors are elizabeth dunn and michael norton  let me read the description   two professors combine their fascinating and cutting edge research in behavioral science to explain how money can buy happiness if you follow five core principles of smart spending   now, there are a couple of caveats here  the first is that this is not a perfect book  there are very few perfect books out there  i think one of the things you should always keep in mind when you re reading any type of pop science book is asking yourself whenever they have an assertion, asking yourself  is this causation or could it just be correlation? for those of you who have the four hour body, there s an appendix on good science, bad science and spotting the difference, and that s a worthwhile chapter to read  but the example i'll give, and you see this in the media all the time where people will say something like,  people who practice yoga have lower blood pressure, a new study finds   and then, they continue to say,  therefore, you should start doing yoga and it only takes ten minutes a session, three times a week    copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    but if you were to actually dig into the data and you asked yourself, wait a second  is it causation? is the yoga actually causing the blood pressure or could it just be correlation? meaning they re just happening at the same time  so for instance, maybe they re comparing the blood pressure of people in, i don t know, a hospital in the bronx   i m just making this up   a sedentary population  then they re checking the blood pressure of people in the west village who are going to yoga class  and it s like well, okay  kevin rose   right, and they re also eating wild salmon several times a week, and also eating salads   tim ferriss   exactly  there s one group eating at mickey d s and fast food, and the other people are eating at whole foods  it s like okay, that could be an issue that s confounding everything  and in this book, there are quite a few places where i think they make arguments of causation where it s probably correlation  however, that having been said, there are principles and also stories that illustrate the principles, like paying for things in advance  like i mentioned committing to this holiday christmas trip with my family six months plus in advance so you can benefit from the anticipation  so prepaying for certain types of experiences as opposed to possessions  they walk through what types of experiences tend to give the greatest emotional and psychological roi  they talk about different types of behavioral psychological studies that someone like, say, daniel gilbert might talk about stumbling upon happiness and how you can use them to your advantage  it s not only for people with a ton of disposable income  one could argue that the less income you make, the more important this becomes because you have a fewer absolute number of dollars to spend at liberty, as it were, and the pain of misspending is even greater  i found this book very useful for this particular point in time, meaning new year s resolutions because you can then say take these different questions that they arm you with, and go through your credit card statement  and actually make categories of things you want to start to eliminate, minimize, or add in  i found that to be just a very useful exercise   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    there s tons of information out there about how to invest your money  but every time you make a purchase, you re investing in some respect  you re trading money, this wampum for an experience or a possession that you think is going to give you something  it s a very fast read  kevin rose   it s also available on audio  i got it on audible, by the way  i just downloaded it   tim ferriss   it says 226 pages but i'd say the last 70 pages are notes and references and whatnot,  so it s really only about 150 pages long  you could read it in a day or two  it s a very fast read  so i thought i'd recommend that one, as well  any favorite books from 2015 that you would recommend people check out?  kevin rose   gosh, i'd have to go back and look at my list  i've got it all on audible  oh, one thing before i forget  and this is the random show so we re allowed to jump around a little bit  you were mentioning canned fish just a few minutes ago  so next time you re in town, i want to take you to a place in new york  it s called maiden lane and it is unbelievable  basically what they ve done is they ve created a wine bar that serves nothing but extremely high end canned fish, and they have them stacked on the wall  so you can walk over there and pick out what canned fish you want, and they pair a wine with it and give you cheese with it  it is phenomenal  i go over there and i get cod livers, which sound disgusting but are obviously really nutritious for you  i have cod liver with some cheese and a really dry white wine and it s just a fun place to hang out   tim ferriss   is that after your pilates or before your pilates?  kevin rose   i know you would love it  what s funny is that you act all tough here but if you came to town, you d be like oh, cod liver, i love this   inaudible      crosstalk  tim ferriss   are you kidding? no, totally  i'd wear my  i'm trying to decide what type of turtleneck and skinny jeans i'd bring  i'd be down, man   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    i'm totally down for the canned fish  it s easy to travel with, also  so if you go to a location, and a lot of tropical places are like this  i shouldn t say tropical  i should say island cultures have very mediocre food  because aside from the fish, they have to bring everything in  it s very expensive  they re often very onerous excise and import taxes  so the food quality tends to be pretty low  so in a best case scenario, highway robbery  so raveling with cans of sardines, i though it would be difficult  and maybe i'm just an outlier but it made it through with no problem whatsoever  have you read radical acceptance? kevin rose   yes   tim ferriss   what did you think? because i think daria was actually one of the first people to recommend it to me  it s by tara brock   kevin rose   i'm looking at audible right now  oh, you know what? i didn t read it  i ended up watching her ted talk   tim ferriss   that s the danger of ted talks   kevin rose   which is pretty much the same thing   tim ferriss   i think the book is very worth reading  tara was on the podcast  she s a buddhist teacher and i'm very skeptical always of people who are self described teachers of different faiths or aspects of spirituality because there is a lot of nonsense out there  tara is absolutely the real deal her dharma talks are incredible,  but this book, radical acceptance, was recommended to me not only by daria, who is about as non woo woo as you can get  phd in neuroscience  but at least one or two other scientists recommended it to me, which i thought was very unusual for a book in this genre  it s in effect how to stop beating the shit out of yourself, or carrying around anger and resentment  it s very, very good  i'm just going to read a couple of highlights  i'm looking at my kindle highlights on my laptop, and i have 60 highlighted passages  but here are just a few  i tend to highlight things that either i want to remember or review, or lines that have nice turns of phrase or wording  here it is   i k new i would never treat a friend the way i treated myself  without mercy or kindness   so one of my resolutions that i'm going to then put into a measurable form that i can assess somehow is to treat myself the way i would treat a very close friend  because i do  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    think i have a habit to really kind of smash my head against the wall and to be very unforgiving to myself  let me find another one  and i know, kevin, you can attest to the fact that there are a lot of successful   and unsuccessful   but very successful people in silicon valley who could identify with this   as a friend of mine put it   quote   feeling that something is wrong with me is the invisible and toxic gas i'm always breathing, end quote   i just think that this book is extremely helpful for walking people through the thought process in making subconscious judgments conscious so they can deal with them, so they can somehow fix them  let me find one more  i'll give one more example  this is a story about a tiger that was in captivity in a zoo named mohini that was rescued from an animal sanctuary  mohini had been confined to i think it was a ten by ten foot cage with a concrete floor for five or ten years  they finally released her into this big pasture   with excitement and anticipation, they released mohini into her new and expensive environment, but it was too late  the tiger immediately sought refuge in a corner of the compound, where she lived for the remainder of her life  she paced and paced in that corner until an area 12 by 12 feet was worn bare of  01 04 00  grass   perhaps the biggest tragedy in our lives is that freedom is possible, yet we can pass our years trapped in the same old patterns   this is where the review of the 2015  okay, we re back after a bahamian internet connectivity interruption  the power has been going out intermittently for the last three days across the entire island  the story wasn t that interesting so i will leave it where it cut off and continue  mr  rose, over to you  kevin rose   yes  i just have one last thing to say  you asked me about book recommendations earlier and i couldn t recall lit off the top of my head  but i pulled up my audible account   tim ferriss   shit  i lost you, buddy  can you hear me?  kevin rose   i can hear you, yes   tim ferriss   okay, you re back  forge ahead   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin rose   maybe we should just call it a show?  tim ferriss   i'd say we re getting close to that point   kevin rose   we re getting close, okay  so the last thing i wanted to say was just my book recommendation that i have for the episode  it s called the good gut, have you heard of it?  tim ferriss   no  is it like wheat belly?  kevin rose   no, this is all about gut bacteria and how they influence your overall health  this is a pair of scientists that wrote this book that actually rhonda had on her podcast, as well  really fascinating stuff about how gut bacteria influences health, how animals bring in healthy bacteria so actually having a dog could potentially be a good thing for you  so letting them lick you on the mouth is not that horrible   tim ferriss   it s a good thing i make out with my dog so much   kevin rose   exactly  but there s really interesting data around c sections and how not passing through the vaginal canal could potentially harm the baby in that they re not getting a lot of their mother s bacteria  and they re actually getting a lot of the bacteria from the nurses  hands, which is really not a great way to set the stage for your bacteria when you re born  so it s really data dense, packed with good information and it cites a bunch of studies  i just found it fascinating because i've always had a weak stomach and have recently started supplementing with probiotics, the vsl 3 that rhonda recommends   tim ferriss   yeah, vsl 3 is good stuff   kevin rose   it s been a world of difference so i highly recommend the book  it gets a little technical  if you don t know if you ll like it, watch rhonda patrick s podcast, first  but yes, it was eye opening for me   tim ferriss   cool  my last share will be just a couple of quotes that i've been revisiting because i think they all have applications to my life in 2016  i will share some of them  the first is from henry ford  here s the quote   nothing is particularly hard if you divide it into small jobs   so really breaking things down in, to use gtd parlance, the next physical action   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    the next is from george s  patton jr , u s  army general   a good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan next week   that s another one i think will apply to my life a lot in january specifically, trying to ready, fire, aim in effect  next is charles bukowski, controversial but popular writer   unless it comes unasked out of your heart and your mind and your mouth and your gut, don t do it   and i think this applies to me  kevin rose   that s a great one  i love that   tim ferriss   yes  that applies to me as far as writing  if you hear something crunching in the background, that s my dog eating a bull pizzle, otherwise known   kevin rose   toaster s also running around because daria just got home and he hears his leash and collar   tim ferriss   that s okay  bull pizzle aside, which is just bowl penis for those people wondering   kevin rose   and you actually consume that as well, which is odd   tim ferriss   i do  if i don't have jerky on hand, bull pizzle will do   kevin rose   bull penis   tim ferriss   this applies to me because i get asked a lot, are you working on a new book? and for me, i don t choose to write a book and then write a book  i write a book because i have to get it out of my head  it gets to a point where there s such an incessant obsession with something that if i don t get it out of my head, it s unhealthy and that s when i write a book  when i can no longer keep it inside of me  so there it goes  that s the bukowski  next is, and i'm sure somebody who s listening can give the original, but this is actually a quote from jennifer anniston, but she s quoting somebody else  she says,  somebody once said   quote   everything you want in the world is just right outside of your comfort zone, end quote   i thought that was also very appropriate to a bunch of decisions that i'm nervous about making in the next few months that i shouldn t be nervous about   kevin rose   that s awesome  these are great to start the new year  i love stuff like this  very inspirational   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   james cameron is next, who has not only been an incredible filmmaker but has really been a groundbreaking technologist in the filmmaking world, and outside of film  so avatar, terminator, etc  and some of his mistakes, actually, like abyss  the abyss was a failure, commercially but they developed the technology that was then used in terminator 2  so quote   if you set your goals ridiculously high and it s a failure, you will fail above everyone else s success   i thought that was a good one  can you hear me, kevin? godammit  i'm going to finish without kevin, fuck it  and then i'm going to call him back so we re back again  i thought this was going to be easy, relaxed   kevin rose   next time three quotes instead of ten   tim ferriss   now i'm going to have to edit this goddamn thing  just a few more, because i'm going to push it   kevin rose   if i drop, just finish without me   tim ferriss   well, i almost did   kevin rose   happy new year, everyone   tim ferriss   exactly  so the next is ray bradbury, 256  i keep these paginated  here it is   don t worry about things, don t push  just do your work and you ll survive  the most important thing is to have a ball, to be joyful, to be loving, and to be explosive  out of that comes everything in you grow   so end to be explosive was the reason i included that  i think that massive action, not action, is often a difference of degree that makes all the difference  two more, and then we re done  283  kurt vonnegut jr , one of my favorite writers of all time   i want to say as close to the edge as i can without going over  out on the edge, you see all kinds of things you can t see from the center   so that s similar to what i've talked about before, the extremes in forming the mean but not vice versa  and the last one is a philosopher named daniel dennett   the chief trick to making good mistakes is not to hide them, especially not from yourself   that s it  so become a documentarian of your own life  keep track of those mistakes and share them so you can at least help someone else  but by showcasing your mistakes and analyzing them, i think  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    that s how you very often avoid repeating them  so that s it, man  that s all i got  kevin rose   love it, good stuff  happy new year  happy new year to everyone out there and we ll see you again soon on the random show   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    "
138,146,146: Random Show ,"   hello, boys and girls  this is tim ferriss  welcome to another episode of the  tim ferriss show   this is not going to be a longform interview where i dissect and deconstruct a world class performer  instead, this is a special edition random show where i am joined by kevin rose,  on twitter, serial entrepreneur, and all around wild and crazy guy  we're going to get started right now  ladies and gents, welcome to another episode of  the random show,  aka also variant  the tim ferriss show   i am tim ferriss   kevin rose   i m kevin rose   tim ferriss   welcome to internet audio   kevin rose   it is good to be here  dude, we re doing another random show  it s been a long time   tim ferriss   it s been a long time  we got to do a bit of banya, russian bath, before venturing back to casa rose   kevin rose   yes  the russian bath was awesome  we did a little bit of relaxation  we spent probably an hour and a half in there   tim ferriss   we spent an hour and a half going back and forth between hot and cold   kevin rose   that s right  cheers, by the way   tim ferriss   cheers  got a little wine here  it s so weird not having a camera on us   kevin rose   it is, but now we can unabashedly gaze into each other s eyes with uncomfortable eye contact  we could both sit here naked if we wanted to  it doesn t really matter   tim ferriss  kevin rose   maybe we are   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   so it s been a little while   kevin rose   yes   tim ferriss   i haven t seen you guys in ages  i haven t had a chance to fondle and   you ll see where this is going   say hello to toaster in a while  that s the dog, for those people wondering   kevin rose   yeah  i have a mini labradoodle  he s 5 years old, 23 pounds  he s an awesome little dude  every time tim comes over, toaster gets really excited, but he also gets manhandled a little bit because that s how you treat dogs, which is fine   tim ferriss   fifty shades of labradoodle   kevin rose   that s right   tim ferriss   i don t think he s into it   kevin rose   that s right   tim ferriss   toaster, what a cutie  we haven t really caught up in a while  obviously we re hanging at the banya, and bullshitting, and catching up on certain facets, but i don t know what types of things you re really into these days   kevin rose   yeah  let s start with the sauna use  you were really the one that kind of got me into this in that we started talking about using the sauna  you mentioned it in a handful of your podcasts and whatnot  you had dr  rhonda patrick on your show talking about cold therapy  then wim hof you had on your show  after that, i was like,  you know what? i m going to get into this wim hof method   i signed up for the 10 week course, and i just now as of last week completed all 10 weeks  my final week number 10 exercise was to go as long as you possibly can in the cold  for me, it was an ice bath, so i went out and bought 10 bags of ice at the corner store  i hauled them up my stairs  i dumped them into already cold water coming in out of the tap into my bathtub  this is in the middle of winter in new york  i climbed into the tub and did 15 minutes in the ice bath submerged up to my neck, which was  inaudible    copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   awesome   kevin rose   i ve come a long way since week 1  for people that don t know   i m sure a lot of people listened to the wim hof episode, but it s great  wim holds several world records   tim ferriss   twenty plus world records   kevin rose   yeah  it s something like that as far as exposure to the cold and timed swimming under ice   tim ferriss   he ran a full marathon in the namib desert without any water at an ungodly 130 degrees or whatever it was  now, i should say i feel obligated to mention this is not the type of thing you want to diy in terms of instruction  the exposure to cold, certainly when immersed in water, these various breathing exercises can be very dangerous, if not fatal  one of my friends recently had a shallow water blackout because he was practicing in water and remained submerged unconscious for three minutes   kevin rose   that s really scary   tim ferriss   that is how you die or end up with permanent brain damage, so never practice this type of breath hold work in water or near water, and get qualified supervision  do not do this solo ever   kevin rose   yeah  the 10 week course is a combination, as you said, of breath work and cold exposure  i always kept the two extremely separate  i didn t even do them near each other because of just that  i had heard some stories and rumors  wim mentions it as well to keep those more or less separate  you start off with a really simple week 1 of just taking a standard hot shower and then ending with 30 seconds of cold   tim ferriss   a cold finish   kevin rose   a cold finish, if you will   tim ferriss   i don t know what you re thinking about that prompted that laugh   kevin rose   it s never that friendly  it s never going to be fun  it was hard  it was a challenge at first because your body is just not used to it at  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    all  i will say the weirdest thing though  forget the whole 10 weeks  at about week 3   and i ve always considered myself a pretty positive person, but i noticed about a 20 to 30 percent increase in mood  i was just feeling happier about random stuff, like work, my interactions with other humans, and my relationship with my wife, and little tasks that would just get under my skin in the past just became softened  tim ferriss   how often were you doing the cold finish?  kevin rose   i was practicing at this point five times a week   tim ferriss   five times a week?  kevin rose   yes   tim ferriss   it wasn t extra time  in other words, you were doing it when you were taking showers anyway   kevin rose   that s right, so first thing in the morning for me  darya, my wife, was just like,  who are you?  i would jump out of the shower, and she d be lying in bed still asleep      i d be like fists in the air like a wild man, all pumped up and jazzed  you know some of the science behind this  you should probably mention what happens when you get hit with the cold   tim ferriss   i remember i looked at this when writing the 4 hour body way back in the day  there was a chapter called  ice age,  with ray cronise, a really fascinating guy everybody should look up  it looked at fat loss and how to use ice or cold exposure to accelerate that  there are a number of physiological responses, only some of which we understand  noradrenaline or epinephrine release is one  the immunological enhancements that people have observed in, say, wim hof and his students where he s able to be injected with various bacterial toxins that he can mitigate a sort of fever response to through breath work seems to be correlated with that type of adrenal system response  you also have different hormones like adenapectin, which is associated with greater fat loss, but the fact of the matter is i do believe even at that point in 2009 or so when i was finishing the 4hour body that there was at least preliminary data from studies to  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    suggest that cold exposure could produce effects comparable to some antidepressants  it is real  kevin rose   one hundred percent   tim ferriss   it is really real   kevin rose   i don t know if you know this, but back in the day when van gogh cut his ear off, they put him in an insane asylum   tim ferriss   understandable   kevin rose   do you know what the treatment was? it was ice baths twice a day   tim ferriss   really?  kevin rose   yeah  that was the treatment for insanity, and apparently it worked on a lot of people  it bought them down to a more real level  i was insane, probably, for doing this, but it s been amazing  i completed the 10 weeks  i m sold  i m hooked on ice  i m a technology investor, and i m looking to actually fund some additional research in this area so we can get more data  your point on the minimal effective dose that you write about so often, what is that for humans to get a positive response out of this?  tim ferriss   what temperature? what duration?  kevin rose   exactly   tim ferriss   what type of submersion?  kevin rose   i ve seen this, and i 100 percent know that it s real  there s nothing else  i m not meditating additionally  i haven t changed my diet  nothing else has changed  that that with a grain of salt because it s one person, but i ve heard this with many people  there are really positive effects to be had here   tim ferriss   i actually am glad that you made the ask of the audience, and i suppose people can ping us on twitter, so we ll give the handles out in a minute  i also have a request for the audience related to cold  that is if anyone can suggest, build, or even spec out theoretically what a device would look like that is an immersion circulator, like  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    you would use for sous vide, that cools water quickly so that i wouldn t have to buy the ice  i don t have an ice machine at home  at one point i was thinking of getting a massive  mosquito coast  type ice machine made from hoshizaki, which is what larry hamilton has  the greatest big wave surfer of all time has a gigantic hoshizaki machine because he uses so much ice for ice baths  kevin rose   i m actually in the process of buying one of those machines right now   tim ferriss   okay  what my question is for people out there   and the physics here might be impossible  we ll see  if there s a device i could drape into the water to    kevin rose   you want a cold sous vide for yourself   tim ferriss   i want a cold sous vide for myself, effectively  the reason being if i buy ice   and maybe this has happened to you  it s certainly happened to me  i ve done hundreds and hundreds of ice baths  i ll get the ice, and either sit around a little long and it ll melt, or i will put it into the bath, get distracted, and be like,  all right  i m going to do the ice bath in 20 minutes,  and then 40 minutes pass  i m like,  oh, no  it s already 10 degrees warmer    kevin rose   right, or you get into the bathtub and it melts because your body temperature melts it, and then it s not as cold   tim ferriss   there are a lot of issues with it  if i could use a device to maintain a cold temperature precisely, that would be really appealing  maybe there s some type of lining with coils   that sounds really dangerous as i say it   that you could put into a tub, maybe even an electric blanket  it s obviously not to electrocute you, but a blanket you could sit or lay on that would cool the temperature   kevin rose   professional athletes take ice baths all the time, so there has to be equipment for this already   tim ferriss   i m guessing in that particular case that you re basically sitting inside an ice box in the sense that they re using freon gas or something like that  it s a la refrigerator style, to cool the casing of the bath  if anybody out there has any ideas for technology that would allow you to  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    have ice baths without ice, i would be very, very interesting  you can let me know, or kevin, if you re interested in conducted coldrelated research and have some qualifications  kevin rose   yes, please   tim ferriss   it s   kevin rose   and  on twitter   tim ferriss   sweet  that s cold   kevin rose   yeah  it was fun  it was a great little fun experiment  i m glad i did it  i m sticking with it  tonight, what d we do? it was probably a total of five minutes   tim ferriss   it s probably five minutes, and that was a really cold plunge   kevin rose   it was pretty close to freezing   tim ferriss   in this particular banya, i would say it was high 30s, very, very, very cold, but therefore my favorite since it s the contrast that i find so appealing  if you re interested in the athletic applications of this type of thing, you can look up contrast therapy  i believe the east germans were very well known for using it, among other things they used, of course  their female swim team sounded like dudes in the locker room, so it wasn t just ice  i digress  let me throw out two things that we don t necessarily have to spend a ton of time on that i ve discovered in the last week that i ve really been enjoying  the first is something called yaktrax  i was looking for this, much like i was looking for this ice device, and i eventually found it  this was in montana  i had accidentally brought boots where the exterior was perfect for the environment, but the sole was slick  it was horrible for walking on snow or ice  these yaktrax, which you can fit in a jacket pocket, have coils  they re otherwise made of rubber, and you basically hook it onto your heel, drag it up, and hook it onto your toe  you can walk just flawlessly across snow or ice  it s fantastic  even for use in, say, a city, they re very easy to walk with  if i were in new york city and i didn t want to have to wear  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    huge sorel boots   which i also wore for snowmobiling, which were amazing   i would just use the yaktrax  kevin rose   i need these  i didn t tell you this, but about three weeks ago in new york, everything was frozen  i got out of an uber  i may or may not have had two to three glasses of wine, and i hit a patch of ice  i just stood on a patch of ice, and i went straight down and hit my chin on the ground   tim ferriss   oh, my gosh  that s horrible   kevin rose   darya freaked out  she was just like,  oh, my gosh  are you okay?   tim ferriss   so wait  you did a superman banana peel, like feet behind you and went face first?  kevin rose   face first, chin right on the concrete  i m lucky i didn t break something  this is awesome, yaktrax  i will definitely buy a pair of these   tim ferriss   yeah  yaktrax is just such an elegant solution  the way they re designed is really smart  it s just a clean, simple design   kevin rose   which one did you get, the xtr, the run, or pro? do you know?  tim ferriss   i ended up getting the walk, and not because the walk is necessarily the only model i would choose  it was the only one available in my size   kevin rose   you re a shoe pioneer  you were the first one to ever tell me about vibrams like 10 years ago   tim ferriss   the vibram fivefingers? yeah   kevin rose   do you still wear those or no?  tim ferriss   i don t, and it s not because of the health claims that they made too strongly, some of which were debunked  it s because of two factors  i do wear zero drop shoes, though   kevin rose   what are those?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   zero drop, meaning the toes and heel are at the same elevation  these gum sole vans that i m wearing right now are zero drop  converse would be the same  vivobarefoot, i think terra is the name of the company, also is zero drop  i do wear those  number 1, the vibrams can really cause achilles tendonitis if you re not accustomed to zero drop shoes  number 2, i just really found them hazardous to my heels and plantar fasciitis, walking on concrete and asphalt  walking barefoot on soil is one thing  walking barefoot on concrete is quite another   kevin rose   yeah  i mean, i found the day after my feet were just sore  i kind of thought that was a good thing, though  i thought,  oh, i m working muscles that i didn t work before    tim ferriss   walking i think is fine  the biggest issue for me was they ended up smelling terrible, even if i used the injinji japanese style socks   kevin rose   there are sprays and stuff for that though, right?  tim ferriss   these were horrendous  speaking of not horrendous, the next little one i ll throw out is an app that i downloaded literally yesterday, and it has blown my mind  it s called bumble  if you ve ever tried tinder and you are a male, this is a better version  it s probably a better version for women as well  the big difference is the following  if you match   and everything else is fairly standard  you set the geographical range and age range   kevin rose   are you still swiping left and right?  tim ferriss   you re still swiping left and right  there are a few ui difference, but here s the biggest difference  if you have a match, the woman has to text first, and you disappear in 24 hours if she doesn t text you  there s a time constraint on matches, and the ball is immediately in the court of the woman  why is this good?  kevin rose   yeah   tim ferriss   this is good because on tinder, match, or any other   ok cupid, it doesn t matter   what happens? any semi attractive or attractive woman gets hit with thousands of yahoos sending stupid messages   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    as a guy, you also have, therefore, less than a snowball s chance in hell unless you find somebody who s only been on the service for like four days because the recipient is just deluged with idiocy  you spend a lot of time sending messages that never get read and never get responded to  this flips that dynamic entirely on its head  kevin rose   have you gotten a lot of responses?  tim ferriss   granted we re new york city where the density is insane, but i ve never seen anything like this   kevin rose   wow   tim ferriss   it is absolutely insane   kevin rose   can i use your profile real quick? can i try it? you wouldn t hand me the phone earlier, by the way, before we started this   tim ferriss   for those of you who listen to this show, you will agree that kevin has given me no reason to trust him using my phone   kevin rose   first of all, i will find your future wife right now, live on this show   tim ferriss   live on this show? all right  well, i ll tell you what  i ll give you a chance here  i m letting kevin take a hold of my phone   kevin rose   she appears to be in her late 20s, early 30s  blonde, dress is medium length  i m going to say no to that one  do you agree?  tim ferriss   you re swiping right while you say no   kevin rose  tim ferriss   whoops  that s okay   kevin rose   right means yes? i ve never done this before  i ve been married for a while  first of all, you ve got to swipe right on that one   tim ferriss   yeah  okay  now explain for people why should i swipe right on this girl?  kevin rose   she s got nerdy glasses on  she s got a nose ring  she s got really pouty lips and a nice little soft jacket  she s cute too  can you see other photos? how do you do that?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   this i actually like  you don t have to tap and then swipe left or right  you swipe vertically to see   kevin rose   she s a little older though  is that too old for you?  tim ferriss   no  she looks cute   kevin rose   swipe right   tim ferriss   i m not judgmental  swipe right  also, big brown eyes, little brown ankles, which i m fond of   kevin rose   she s throwing up a peace sign  she looks a little hammered   tim ferriss   she s cute   kevin rose   you should swipe right on her for sure   tim ferriss   all right  there we go   kevin rose   boom  you got a connection   tim ferriss   and we matched, just like that  literally, i installed this app last night   kevin rose   so the second he matched, two bouncy balls come up, and it shows a b   tim ferriss   more bumble or start a chat  i ve never started a chat before, so let s try it   kevin rose  tim ferriss   no, you re not allowed to  i m not allowed to  she has to do it   kevin rose   it s in her court   tim ferriss   right  there we go  i exit out  this is so low labor as a male  every male listening to this who is over the age of 20 has spent thousands of hours vainly attempting to get female attention and wasted a disgustingly high percentage of their liquid   kevin rose   you just like it because you don t have to do anything   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   i like it because it forces the woman to express interest and prequalify in that sense so that the conversation isn t a total waste of time   kevin rose   what do they say?  tim ferriss   it s lightweight  they re like,  hey    kevin rose   they re not using pick up lines on you or anything   tim ferriss   women don t have to do that, so no  they re not doing that  i just really like that it s flipping the normal approach entirely on its head   kevin rose   do you drop, like,  hey, i have some books out,  and stuff?  tim ferriss   i don t  i do not   kevin rose   you have to at some point   tim ferriss   well, i ll say i m a writer  i feel conflicted about this because it s weird to be a public facing person in any capacity and try to date  it s just a weird situation that creates all sorts of    kevin rose   but it s also awesome   tim ferriss   it s awesome until it gets really weird, funky, and crazy, if it does   kevin rose   right, like today at the sauna   tim ferriss   what?  kevin rose   we were in the locker room getting naked   tim ferriss   that was weird  it was a little uncomfortable   kevin rose   two guys are like,  tim, i love your book   we re all naked   tim ferriss   i m just in my underwear  i m like,  do i take my underwear off now in front of these guys?  they were perfectly polite, but i m like,  i m not sure what to do in this situation  what s the protocol? do i just let the johnson flop out and go for it?   kevin rose   i think you just have to show them the goods  they buy your book   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   i ll be like,  you bought the book  now experience the full    kevin rose   you get the extended chapter   tim ferriss   oh, god  net net, very positive thing  bumble for people who have been frustrated, male or female, i think it s worth checking out   kevin rose   that s awesome   tim ferriss   what about you?  kevin rose   next on my list, a little self promotion  i launched a newsletter  i wanted to plug that for a second   tim ferriss   it s a really well done newsletter   kevin rose   thank you   tim ferriss   i ve got to be honest  i was expecting more spelling errors   kevin rose   i spent a lot of time   tim ferriss   i was really impressed with the newsletter  usually when i get text messages from you, it s like you re typing with your knuckles   kevin rose   typically i ve had a couple of glasses of wine, and it gets a little sloppy  in all seriousness, one of the things i wanted to do is   i love newsletters  i get yours and probably 10 others  something that i find a little bit frustrating   i don t know if you ve run into this, but especially on ones that come out every single day is people don t take the time to probably vet what they re talking about  you ll get a lot of product recommendations, and see,  check out this app  check out this website,  or whatever it may be  the stuff is just that they re recycling press releases versus actually having spent time with something  i created a newsletter called the journal  you can check it out at www thejournal email  that s actually a domain name  dot email is a thing now  you can sign up  basically, what i do is spend one month  i only send one a month  it s not going to overflow your inbox  i fully vet every single thing i talk about  if i talk about a cool piece of electronics, a gadget, a knife, or something i find really interesting, i ve spent at least a month or more playing with it, using it, fully vetting it, making sure that it s worth your time   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    all of our time is valuable  the last thing i would want is you to click on something that s trash or garbage  it s only once a month, so you only get 12 a year  it s obviously completely free  i basically put in really cool videos  every single day, i watch a ted talk, and i pick one out of the entire month that i really enjoyed and put it in there  tim ferriss   what was the last one you put in?  kevin rose   the last one i did was actually a talk by    tim ferriss   i remember because i actually reached out to him afterwards   kevin rose   oh, really?  tim ferriss   help me out  this was the zen hospice center   kevin rose   the guy that runs the zen hospice center   tim ferriss   in san francisco   kevin rose   yes   tim ferriss   amazing guy, and i m embarrassed to be blanking on his name   kevin rose   did you watch the talk?  tim ferriss   i did watch it  the reason that it struck such a chord is that he is a friend of a friend of our mutual friend adam gazzaley, the neuroscientist who is on my podcast  i didn t know that   kevin rose  tim ferriss   i was at princeton shortly after this gentleman we re referring to who gave the ted talk and now runs this hospice center climbed on top of this train and had his one arm and both legs electrocuted off of his body, effectively   kevin rose   they were like blown off of his body   tim ferriss   yes  that was a cautionary tale when i went into my freshman year because it had just happened a few years before  that is a great talk  everybody should watch this  i m so embarrassed i can t remember the guy s name  do you have a sample issue up?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin rose   if you sign up for the newsletter, you get the last issue automatically  the second you sign up, within two minutes you get the last issue  it s basically about six to eight things in there  i tend to do a couple of videos, a piece of electronics, something you can carry with you, like a cool gadget or something, like a great pen   tim ferriss   throwing stars   kevin rose   some ninja throwing stars  the thing for me here is why yet another newsletter? the only reason is because i am constantly playing with the latest electronics and all different types of things out there  i want to put just the absolute best out   tim ferriss   you re one of maybe four or five newsletter that i subscribe to  that s it   kevin rose   awesome  i appreciate that  thank you   tim ferriss   it would be remiss of me not to mention if you ve done a few lines of coke and are really eager to sign up for every newsletter that    kevin rose   there s one guy out there right now who s like,  fuck  i m high as shit  i m on it    tim ferriss   that is five bullet friday, which is my newsletter  it s sent out a little more frequently, once a week, with the five things that i have found most fascinating or useful  we re like jerking each other s newsletters off right now, but the one that you did, i bought that stupid thing you did with the roller pin that has the knobby knobs on it   kevin rose   tim ferriss   the rumbleroller   kevin rose   the rumbleroller, yeah   tim ferriss   dude, that thing is a game changer  i travel with that   kevin rose   tell people about that   tim ferriss   i travel with it  i have been a foam rolling skeptic for years partially because i ve faithfully done foam rolling with various devices and seen very little return until i got this device called the rumbleroller   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin rose   you mean foam rolling as far as rolling out your muscles and stuff like that   tim ferriss   yes, rolling out my it bands or my adductors   kevin rose   i m going to get wine  keep talking   tim ferriss   i will  i had seen very little roi  there were a few devices that i found very helpful from, say, kelly starrett  for instance, the mobilitywod  there s one called the gemini and a few others that i did find useful  in general, foam rolling i found very difficult and not worth the time invested until i found this thing called the rumbleroller, which has knobs  if you can imagine a motocross bike tire turned into a foam roller that has a very hard consistency, this is that device  i travel with the 12 inch or 18 inch version of that  it literally travels with me everywhere  that is the squeaking of another bottle of wine opening, so i will continue with my next recommendation  that was a fully studio version of opening wine  that was incredible  nice  kevin cut his poor little finger open  too bad we re not doing anymore glucomen or ketone testing  save you the troubles and just cut off the tip of your finger  i am doing something a little weird  wait  first, last bit of call in the next 10 minutes, and you ll get this for free  five bullet friday, if you haven t received it, it has a more than 60 percent open rate  if you re involved in email, that s bonkers   kevin rose   dude, that s actually right where i m at right now with mine as well   tim ferriss   nice  i think it s because vetted recommendations just do the job  it s incredible  five bullet friday, if you go to www fourhourworkweek friday, it ll pop right up  you can check that out  it s free  it always will be  next on the list, i will bring up a book that i ve been enjoying as a devout non fiction purist for a long time, i am enjoying delving yet again back into fiction  this book that i m going to recommend is short and easy to read, and it is hilarious, as is toaster who is waggling his head with metal attached to it  the baron in the trees  i think the guy s name is italo calvino or something   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    the baron in the trees was recommended to me by my brother, and my brother and my mother are both very, not high brow, but they have high standards for books  they never recommend anything unless they love it, and they don t love more than one out of every 20 books they pick up  there ve been two books in the last maybe 10 years that have been strongly, strongly recommended to me by my brother and mother, in one case, which is motherless brooklyn  that is great, hilarious book about a detective with tourette s syndrome in brooklyn   and then the baron in the trees  the baron in the trees is an older book about a young baron who gets in a huge dispute with his father over dinner, runs outside, climbs up a tree, and stays in the trees for the rest of his life  he has love affairs, learns how to hunt, learns how to build things, work on architectural problems, and it s a fun book to read   kevin rose  tim ferriss   what is most convenient about it as a fiction book is that unlike something like game of thrones, for instance, the golden compass, or even dune, something with really intense world building and a lot of characters, you get to meet the primary characters in the baron in the trees within the first 20 pages, and you can stop for a week or two and pick up right where you left off without having to reread the previous three or four chapters  is this on audio as well? i don t know if it s on audio  honestly, there s part of   because i do have the audio book club with audible  that s www audible com timsbooks   is i want to just make all of these things into audio  it frustrates me that they re not available, but it s a lot of work to turn these things into audio  i don t know  if it isn t, it should be turned into audio, and i ll leave someone in the audience  i will pass the baton to you, and you can reach out to acquire rights to produce audio, but it s a great book, the baron in the trees   kevin rose   awesome  next up for me, i want to talk about the fitbit blaze  this is the new device from fitbit that came out just a few weeks ago, actually two weeks ago  i picked it up  i ve been a fitbit user for a long time  tim, i don t think we ve ever talked about how you track your heart rate or anything else   tim ferriss   we have not   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin rose   do you track it at all?  tim ferriss   i don t right now  i have a device that i am blanking on the name of, which is a heart rate variability focused heart rate monitor  i m going to be literally shaving half of the hair off of my chest to put this, not implant, but effectively paste this onto my chest for seven days straight  it ll be 24 7 heart rate data gathered from the chest that i will then ship off for analysis   kevin rose   that s clinical grade heart rate monitoring   tim ferriss   that s right, but in terms of    kevin rose   i was going to say if you want sleep data, you don t have to shave your chest to get it   tim ferriss   no, you don t have to do that, but i m a whacko that way  i m doing it as part of something called the health nucleus through a company called human longevity inc , which i ve invested in  it was cofounded by greg venter who sequenced the first human genome   kevin rose   oh, i ve heard about this   tim ferriss   and peter diamandis, chairman of the x prize and bob hariri who is a stem cell expert   kevin rose   is adam involved in this at all?  tim ferriss   i don t know if adam is involved   kevin rose   okay  he mentioned this, one of our scientist friends   tim ferriss   they have massive data crunching capabilities  part of the testing included full body mris, full genome sequencing, et cetera  the take home homework in this case was to shave your chest and paste this on, which i have yet to do  shaving my chest   i m like a silverback gorilla  it s a lot of work to contend with, so i ve put it off  i ll be starting that in the next day or two   kevin rose   back to the fitbit stuff   good luck with the shaving   i ve been a fitbit user since day 1  i ve tried all these different ones, whether  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    it s the fitbit one or the jawbone  i even tried the microsoft one briefly, and then also the withings  tim ferriss   the costco version   kevin rose   the costco version  whatever it is, i ll try it  i really like the one from misfit  misfit was great   tim ferriss   yeah, misfit was great   kevin rose   they had a long battery life  it was really lightweight, but it would pop out all the time, and i would lose it  long story short, for me, i always try to hit 3,000 calories a day or 10,000 steps per day   tim ferriss   i thought you were going to say 10,000 calories per day  i was like,  i guarantee the watch isn t going to help you    kevin rose   one or the other  i ve always wanted something that does heart rate, so they came out with the fitbit hr here probably i d say a year and a half or two years ago  i used that for a while, but this just came out, and it has a full display, almost like an apple watch does  the thing i like about it is that you can go into situations, whether it be running on the treadmill, lifting weights, or sauna use, and you can track your heart rate and time things as well  today, you saw me doing it  when we went to the sauna, i go in there and say,  i m going to go in the sauna  i m going to try to hit 10 minutes in the heat   one of two things  either i hit 10 minutes and i leave and take a break, or my heart rate will hit 130 to 140  if it hits that, then i also take a break because i know it s just too much for me  the one thing i did is i went and did a bunch of research on all these different trackers and tried to find the one with the highest temperature rating because i want it to withstand the heat  i ve taken my iphone, for example, into a sauna, which was probably stupid, but i wanted to listen to a podcast  i put it on the ground so it would be at the lowest possible temperature in the sauna, and after about 10 minutes, it puts a warning screen up saying  overheating,  and then i had to kick it outside the door so that i wouldn't lose my iphone and it wouldn t melt   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    this device, i can go in the hottest possible saunas, and it works great  it looks like an apple watch  it s a little bit uglier  just real talk, it s ugly  tim ferriss   it s not that bad  you re a watch snob  i m sorry  you have high standards for watches   kevin rose   yeah  typically, i wear a mechanical watch on my 9 to 5 at hodinkee  but this for me does what i want it to do in that for me, i want heart rate tracking  i want sleep tracking  i want long battery life  it has a five day battery, which is awesome, and then i can recharge it when i m at work   tim ferriss   what is the name of this model?  kevin rose   fitbit blaze  it s  199 00  like i said before, when i m doing stuff in the sauna, it s essential because i can track just the time  when i leave the sauna or get off the treadmill, if i m doing interval training, weights, or whatever, i can hit pause so i can track the total amount of time  it syncs back to the app  i get charts and graphs back on the app  i know that you and i both have a lot of fans that tend to love all things health and fitness  i would say out of all the health and fitness bands out there, this is probably the best one   tim ferriss   it was cool to observe your heart rate change as we went from one temperature to another  or even in the case of when we were sitting in the hottest gulag torture chamber version of a sauna when we were on the top step with the stone mason   i don t even know what you would call it   oven across the room from us  it literally felt like my ears were being crisped like pork rinds  when you poured the water over yourself, we could watch your temperature drop, just plummet   or your heart rate  excuse me  it plummeted on your watch  it was really cool to watch how it oscillated and moved   kevin rose   yeah  when you go into exercise mode, it keeps the heart rate kind of front and center on the device, so you can just flick your wrist up and see instantly what your heart rate is  when you re sitting  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    there in this extreme heat, the water that they pump into the actual place into buckets is freezing cold  tim ferriss   it s super freezing cold   kevin rose   i just dumped it over my head, and i m sitting there at 130 beats a minute  and you see it drop down to 125, 120, 115, 110  it plummets, and it s fun to watch  also when we did the freezing ice bath, the same thing  i was hovering around 100 before i went in and then down to mid 70s once i m in the ice water  i don t know  for people who are geeks like myself or you, i told you when we were leaving  i said,  you should buy one of these   they re great to have when you re working out  you don t have to wear it all the time  the sleep data is great too, so i use it for that  i can definitely see if i had too many cups of coffee the night before  i look at my sleep data, and it s spiky   tim ferriss   what is it displaying, your movement?  kevin rose   it displays movement  exactly  you can see when you ve had a big disturbance, like say you just get up to use the restroom or something   tim ferriss   big disturbance in the force, dropping a deuce after too much fiber   kevin rose   exactly  i don t think that happens in the middle of the night  who does that in the middle of the night? do you do that?  tim ferriss   i thought you were volunteering yourself   kevin rose   no  i m just saying sometimes you ve got to get up and go pee real quick   tim ferriss   yeah, of course  i do that   kevin rose   moreover, it tracks your little micro movements  why are you laughing at me?  tim ferriss   big disturbance  you ve been feeding me wine  i haven t had any booze for four weeks   kevin rose   are you serious? four weeks?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   yeah  i am serious  actually, that s complete horseshit because i just came back from having a lot of booze with a bunch of people   kevin rose   it s been 30 minutes   tim ferriss   i was having more lysine at the time, which affects ethanol metabolism in a very interesting way, which is also in my five bullet friday, wink, wink   kevin rose   do you have any of that on you right now?  tim ferriss   i do not  i have it back at the hotel  in any case, i m sorry to interrupt   kevin rose   i don t have anything else to say  i thought it was a great device  i don t have any vested interest here  if you like it, buy it  it s ugly  it s  199   tim ferriss  kevin rose   that should be the tagline  it s ugly and incredibly useful  exactly  i was really bummed out  i wanted it to look cooler, but it just doesn t, but i love fitbit in general   tim ferriss   i have a couple of random recommendations for folks  i recently spent time in yellowstone national park, and it was the first time i d really spent a lot of time there  it spans across three states  the vast majority is in montana, some in wyoming, and then 1 or 2 percent in idaho  i just had the most unbelievable connected and beautiful tour of yellowstone via cutting edge snowmobile, which was very quiet   kevin rose   is it electric?  tim ferriss   it s not electric but very, very quiet  the only way that you can take tours through yellowstone is to be with a guide who is certified  i wanted to recommend, if you end up in montana   i know this is a small percentage of you listening   if you haven t been to montana, you should go anyway, up in bozeman  then you can take a tour with two top snowmobile rental  i recommend the full day tour  if you can, do it with a smaller group  michelle was my guide, and she was amazing  she knew everything you could possibly want to know about geology, anthropology, animal movement  we saw bison, a coyote hunt, red fox, and bald eagles   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin rose   you hunted coyotes   tim ferriss   no  that sounds weird  we saw a coyote successfully pounce on the snow and push its paws through the permafrost   kevin rose   did you see that coyote video i sent you where it got its head stuck?  tim ferriss   i did  no, its head didn t get stuck  it was literally pushing its head, in the video you sent me, through the snow to get to a weevil or some type of rodent   kevin rose   it was funny though, right?  tim ferriss   it was funny  the coyote does the same thing, but because it has a higher body weight, it can use its paws to pounce  boom  it caught what they call a pocket gopher  then it wagged its tail like a happy dog and pulled this thing out  it was sitting in its mouth  it was incredible to watch  the point being, i also went   speaking of cold   for a dip in the firehole river where there s snow and ice  i passed by a couple of bison and then went skinny dipping in this river for like five minutes  it had to be, i m guessing, high 30s at best  two top snowmobile rental, michelle is fantastic  if you want to see her photographs taken in yellowstone, you can see her on instagram  i think it s  she was just fantastic  i can t say enough about her  i have two more things  do you have anything else?  kevin rose   i have one book, which is from a friend of ours   tim ferriss   okay  let me throw one out there then, which is related in terms of books  going not into the future as a technologist but going very retro, and that is i am beginning once again to   after many decades of not doing this   subscribing to print magazines   kevin rose   so am i   tim ferriss   really?  kevin rose   yes  i just picked this up  have you heard of this magazine? hold on  i m walking over  have you heard of this?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   monocle? yeah  i have   kevin rose   it s great   tim ferriss   it is a very good magazine  i am subscribing to nat geo, so national geographic, and scientific american  the reason being, when you read long form material on a computer, you are at the mercy of a distraction economy with push notifications   kevin rose   i 100 percent agree   tim ferriss   there are social pushes   kevin rose   it s so weird we re both getting into this right now   tim ferriss   do you know what i mean?  kevin rose   when i lay down at night, darya will tell you i have monocle next to me, a magazine or something, or a book  that s my new thing  that s my new jam  it s too easy to get distracted by tab browsing when you re in the browser   tim ferriss   it s nearly impossible not to   kevin rose   email comes in   tim ferriss   you have literally billions of dollars going into studying how to prevent you from focusing   kevin rose   right   tim ferriss   what s your budget? it s certainly not billions of dollars, if you re any normal person  holy shit, dude  that s a heavy pour  wow  that s a lot of wine  i think kevin is about to roofie me  everybody, you are my witness  it s so relaxing and luxurious in a time when you re bombarded by more information every day than you could possibly consume in a lifetime to sit down and single task with a page that has no notifications  it s so relaxing   kevin rose   especially when you know that the people behind whatever you re picking up have spent   it just goes to our point of doing these once every so often newsletters  we spend a lot of time really  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    thinking about what would people really appreciate? what is high quality? that s the same when it goes to print  tim ferriss   doing the heavy lifting  what blew me away   i d never really read scientific american until a few weeks ago  and i ll be honest  most pop science magazines i find not pandering  they re dumbed down to an extent that the science is compromised   kevin rose   it s like mcnews, like usa today   tim ferriss   that s right  scientific american on the other hand, i picked this up, and i read the reader responses  these are letters that come in, in response to previous article  the level of scientific literacy was so impressive to me that i read the rest of the magazine   kevin rose   do you ever read nature?  tim ferriss   i have read nature   kevin rose   it s impossible to read   tim ferriss   it s dense  it s very dense  you need to be a scientist, really, to interpret that  i found scientific american to be a good stretch publication for me because it provides enough context that i can find a foothold to understand a majority of the conversation, but it also pushes me because it involves a lot of good scientists and science writers  specifically, i was reading in this last issue about crispr, which is a gene editing tool and approach which allows precision and speed and cost efficiencies previously impossible  you can literally use this  feel free to veto me, darya, if i say anything really stupid here  i think it s a messenger rna that basically lines up with specific base pairs of dna if you re looking for a specific gene, and you can knock it out, or you can knock something in   kevin rose   of your own genes?  tim ferriss   well, you could do it to yourself  that has a lot of risks   kevin rose   that is really dangerous   tim ferriss   you could do it for your kids, also dangerous or ethically challenging   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin rose   or your friend   tim ferriss   right now, they re experimenting with it as it relates to agriculture, for instance, to make mushrooms that don t brown and get all slimy and gross, or that last at least a few weeks longer   kevin rose   this kind of stuff scares me   tim ferriss   i think that people have well founded fears based on incorrect assumptions  for instance, if you look at genetically modified foods, people are like,  gmo, bad  oh, my gosh  we re all going to die  scary, scary stuff   usually what they re afraid of, if you drill down to it, is transgenic gene modification  in other words, they re taking fish genes and putting it into wheat or doing something really weird, and even i would say unnatural  in this particular case using crispr   and of course, particularly since it will get to a point or is at a point where you can gene edit for a few hundred dollars  it is super inexpensive  i m sure there will be big messes that are created  however, the natural process of, say, plant hybridization, which is gene editing, is not a completely benign process  it s actually a really brute force inaccurate process  there is a podcast which, in full disclosure, i have not yet listened to  it was tweeted out by bill gurley, one of the   i think   smartest vcs, venture capitalists, out there   kevin rose   brilliant   tim ferriss    the best podcast you will ever listen to  was his tweet  it is a podcast about crispr by radiolab  i wanted to throw that out there as well   kevin rose   cool  one thing on my side of the print equation  monocle  definitely pick an issue up  you re going to have to go to a kind of barnes   noble or one of those funky little    tim ferriss   cigar shop?  kevin rose   yeah  it s like a cigar shop combo magazine combo newspapers  you know the shop i m talking about   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   like a chinese variety store with the luggage and the little diver who s swimming around in a bucket plus lottery tickets?  kevin rose   yeah  more or less  but monocle is great  this is the little subtext underneath monocle  it says  a briefing on global affairs, business, culture, and design   they come out with a new issue every month  it's just a fun read  anyway, pick it up  let me know if you like it  that is my take on the print side   tim ferriss   what are these fancy shoes that you re wearing?  kevin rose   these are nike shoes  they re those really thin soled 3 0s they re called  they re nike training shoes   tim ferriss   very colorful   kevin rose   yeah  actually, the ones i like even better, i linked in my last issue of the journal   tim ferriss   wink   kevin rose   no  i didn t do any affiliate codes like you do   tim ferriss   oh, now we re real  i offer non affiliate codes  don t cast stones in your glass house   kevin rose   that s right   tim ferriss   so what    kevin rose   last book   tim ferriss   no  hold on  what were the shoes?  kevin rose   oh, they were just some nikes  they were a combination  they were a running shoe, but they have enough width on them  i haven t showed them to you  they re not downstairs  i ll have to show them to you in minute  they have enough width on them that you can actually lift weights and squat with them as well  so it s almost like a crossfit style shoe  they re amazing  if you d read my entire newsletter, you d know that   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   crossfit style shoe, does it say,  do you even lift, bro?  on the side?  kevin rose   i don t do crossfit  i am not a crossfit fan   tim ferriss   clearly  more alexander technique   kevin rose   are you kidding me? i still have bigger arms than you do   tim ferriss   you and your guns  i know  you re like one of those genetically modified chickens with huge breasts  i don t know how your feet keep you up   kevin rose   dude, why are you hating?  tim ferriss   because you re feeding me alcohol  i m getting all insecure and passive aggressive   kevin rose   you didn t do  roids  it s probably the  roids that you do   tim ferriss   it s true  i have been growing horns, mostly growth hormone   kevin rose   this is when the podcast totally went downhill, the last two minutes   tim ferriss   alpine goat growth hormone  i don t recommend that, folks  i m not a doctor  i don t play one on the internet   kevin rose   all right  let s talk about our friend s book, brodo   tim ferriss   absolutely  this is the final thing   kevin rose   our friend marco, that you actually introduced me to, runs a restraint out here in new york city called hearth  it s phenomenal farm to table food  it s one of my favorite restaurants   tim ferriss   if you fly solo or it s just two of you, sit at the pass if you can, meaning where you can watch all the food coming out   kevin rose   it s an awesome place  i think you d agree  he also has a little window off to the side of the restaurant that is a walk up windows  it s almost like a coffee walk up little station facing the street  you walk up there, and he makes brodo  brodo obviously means bone broth  it s italian for broth  he makes these phenomenal combinations of turkey, chicken, and beef broths along with onions and herbs and turmeric   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    he serves it in a coffee cup, so you get a to go afternoon treat that is just sipping broth  it is awesome  it s ketogenic friendly  it s grass fed bones  he has combinations  one that you haven t heard of that i just tried   i know this because i live here and you don t   which i m really stoked because when we lived in san francisco, we couldn t find this stuff  he does a broth now with chocolate, pure dark chocolate, in coconut milk, which is a really funky combination  tim ferriss   wild  is it all coagulated, unmixed, and nasty, or is it blended up?  kevin rose   no, no  it s good  the one that i tried last week which was amazing was this chicken broth with a chicken egg yolk in there   tim ferriss   that sounds amazing   kevin rose   it was blended up with a couple other spices, which was just phenomenal   tim ferriss   what is your favorite broth so far?  kevin rose   the hearth broth   tim ferriss   is it chicken or beef? what is your preference?  kevin rose   the hearth broth is the blend of all their broths, so it was like a hybrid   tim ferriss   oh, the animal bone medley   kevin rose   yes, exactly  i add the chili  he does this really   babe, do you remember what chili he has in the broth? it s a really spice chili that he adds to the broth  maybe it s sichuan chili   tim ferriss   sichuan cat chili   kevin rose   with bone marrow  that s my go to   tim ferriss   that sounds amazing   kevin rose   long story short, you can only get this in new york  i was really bummed when i lived in san francisco because i couldn t find it anywhere else  to make this stuff, you need a good recipe  it s easy to do, and it s really cheap to do because you can buy bones  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    for dirt cheap from your butcher  the book is called brodo  it s on amazon  go buy it  tim ferriss   marco canora  for those of you who read the 4 hour chef, he popped up a lot  he was super helpful   kevin rose   his book has all of his recipes in it  it s awesome  he also does a bone broth fast in there, which is interesting  it s really cool stuff  and you will be blown away by the flavor of these broths, and it s really healthy for you too  do you know why bone broth is so healthy for you? can you speak to that?  tim ferriss   oh, boy   kevin rose   you get a lot of the nutrients out of the actual marrow, right?  tim ferriss   this is probably a better question for our resident scientist in the room, darya   kevin rose   do you want to talk about it, babe, for a sec? i ll hand you a mic   tim ferriss   if you want to get into the whole bone broth conversation, what do you think, darya? nourishing traditions by sally fallon? is that okay?  darya   yeah   tim ferriss   yeah  i would say nourishing traditions by sally fallon, which talks a lot about the observations of dr  weston price, also very controversial  i think nourishing traditions is a very good basic primer on bone broth and whatnot  if you re going to buy half a dozen cookbooks, i think nourishing traditions is one of the six   kevin rose   what did weston price have to say about it in his book?  tim ferriss   i will default to ms  fallon in nourishing traditions   kevin rose   i was curious  i love his other stuff on cod liver oil and things like that   tim ferriss   i will say   speaking of cod liver oil   that after my podcast with dominic d'agostino, the scientist who has created some incredible exogenous    copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin rose   dr  dom?  tim ferriss   exactly   kevin rose   i love him  he s awesome   tim ferriss   he s amazing  he s so, so good   kevin rose   he s got a great podcast, by the way   tim ferriss   really?  kevin rose   he s got his own podcast, but he only put out one episode so far   tim ferriss   he s so good  he s so, so good  dom is not only an incredible scientist who has created synthetic ketones for navy seals and whatnot, funded by the dod, and is a published researcher, but he is also a beast of an athlete  the guy    kevin rose   is jacked   tim ferriss   he s so incredible  i mean, he did i think it was a six day fast, and then did 500 pounds for 10 reps in the deadlift just to prove that forced production could be maintained after that type of fast  the reason i bring him up is that i asked him what his breakfast looked like  he said,  well, i have a can of sardines   i was like,  which sardines?   then i have some oysters from a can    what kind of oysters?  i adopted his breakfast, and the sardines   this is a really weird thing  i don t know if anybody here will have any theories as to why this is the case, but i started eating the sardines from, i want to say, wild planet   kevin rose   yeah   tim ferriss   i noticed that that two things started to happen  my teeth appeared whiter, and they started to re mineralize  they appeared to remineralize, which makes some sense because you re consuming the bones of the fish  in any case, that s become my go to  when i travel, i literally travel with boxes of sardines if i m going on extended trips   kevin rose   do you want to hear something crazy? this is the honest to god truth  your podcast came out  two days later, i went to whole  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    foods, and i was like,  yeah  i ll do some of that  i ll get some sardines,  because you mentioned the brands and you said they were at whole foods  sold out  you know that s never going to be the case with sardines  it s like the hot seller  tim ferriss   funny you bring this up  i ve heard the same thing from people in austin  i ve heard the same thing from people in multiple cities   kevin rose   that s crazy  dude, you are like a sardine    tim ferriss   sardine oprah?  kevin rose   yeah  you are the sardine oprah, dude  you should get that tshirt  tim ferriss  sardine oprah   tim ferriss   i m sure oprah would love that  she d be like,  well, no  i m not going to do your podcast    kevin rose   that s amazing   tim ferriss   what else do we have?  kevin rose   that s it   tim ferriss   so you have some sardines here  you ve got a different brand   kevin rose   that s because all the others were sold out   tim ferriss   bela, portuguese sardines  this is fun  we should have more wine   kevin rose   it s dinnertime  let s do it   tim ferriss   any closing thoughts?

163,171,"The Random Show – New Favorite Books, Memory Training, and Bets On VR (#171)","'he s a serial entrepreneur and world class investor, and that is not an exaggeration  he is one of the best product guys for those in silicon valley or technology investors i know  what makes him unique is perhaps and unusual combination  he s very good at very early stage investing   seed investing   and at the public markets  he s also an all around wild and crazy guy, which makes for a fun conversation  so we go all over the place ''we talk about new and favorite books, memory training, multiple wives   or maybe i talk about that   bets for or against virtual reality, and much, much more  so please say hi to us on the socials and enjoy ''hello, boys and girls, and welcome to another episode of the random show  i think it is episode 477  i m tim ferris ''kevin rose  and i m kevin rose  thanks for joining us  it s been awhile   a few months  it has been  to be precise, it s been a long while  and we are sitting in your new place ''kevin rose  i just moved in today  a lot of life changes ''kevin rose  speaking of the random show, you hit me up last night and were like,  hey, let s do a random show   it was midnight and you said on tuesday  yesterday was tuesday and i m like,  i m not getting out of bed to do a random show   that would ve been very random, though ''kevin rose  but you meant wednesday  i did mean wednesday ''kevin rose  you re in town for one night  that s right  it s just a sniper shot   in and out  i m excited to dig in because we have a bunch of new interests  but we also have new questions  i realized when i was just developing my bambi legs in the podcasting and interview game  ''kevin rose  episode one  episode one of the tim ferriss show, which we didn t even have a name for at that point, although you nominated tim tim talk talk, which  ''kevin rose  i still think that s the best name and i think you should rename your show  thank you  go to hell  kevin has stuck and people still refer to it as tim tim talk talk ''kevin rose  i see that on twitter from time to time and i always laugh my ass off when i see it  hopefully things have evolved and not devolved, but i remember you giving me so much shit when i put together my list of questions and asked you if you had to be a breakfast cereal which would you be  you were like,  oh, it s going to be one of those interviews   i was like,  oh, stop busting my balls  i m nervous already even though you re my friend   it was my first time recording audio ''so at some point, i m going to lob some questions at you that i ve asked a lot my other guests  i don t know your answers to them, and it sounds like you have some top secret questions to volley from your side ''kevin rose  yes  before the show, tim and i spent five or ten minutes putting together a bullet list of stuff we wanted to talk about  you mentioned wanting to do those new, refreshed questions on me  so of course, i have to come back to you and do some on you as well  you re always on the interviewing side of this equation  why not throw some back to you and see what you come up with? i feel like you grill your guests sometimes  you re like,  what would you put on a billboard,  and they re like,  oh!  it s really difficult to answer this stuff in real time  yeah, some of them are really tough in real time ''kevin rose  i m curious to see how you re going to do  we ll see  yeah, we ll see how well i can tap dance  i ve grown better at the asking, but not necessarily the answering of questions  do you have anything new on yours? i should also say, for those people who are wondering about the prep, we both bullet out a couple of items that are new for us   books, gizmos, or otherwise   but we don t share those notes with each other beforehand  otherwise, it would be boring ''kevin rose  that s right  we tend to leave it as fresh stuff we just came up with  it s typically stuff that we ve used and discovered since the last time we saw each other  that s right ''kevin rose  i ve got three things   do you want me to kick it off with the first one?''tim ferriss  yes, please ''kevin rose  so this one is actually thanks to you  i talked to you on the phone and talked to you about tm meditation  transcendental meditation is a form of meditation that i hadn t actually heard of until you first brought it up  i have a buddy, anish, who s been doing it since he was a child  you know anish  he was at my bachelor party  i do ''kevin rose  and also, our mutual dr  peter attia   i was just talking to him and was asking,  hey, what are some great ways you reduce stress in your life?  he was like,  oh, i ve looked at the literature   he s trained in tm as well  he did an introduction to some of the folks over at the center and i went and gave it a shot  i called you up and was like,  what do you think,  and you were like,  yeah, go do it   peter s been on the podcast, and i was convinced to do my first proper training with tm by two other guests  it was chase jarvis and rick rubin, specifically ''kevin rose  oh crazy  i effectively asked them the same question you asked peter and it just took a while for it to get through my thick skull that i should try it because of the costs involved and various things ''kevin rose  it s not cheap  it s not cheap  and i may collaborate with some of the folks involved at the higher levels of tm to change that  we will see  there are some quirky aspects to it  you sent me a photograph of your  ''kevin rose  my sacrifice    flowers and fruit with the comment,  i feel like i m joining a cult   for a secular person, it s a little tough ''kevin rose  here s the deal  i grew up religious and i drank the blood of christ at communion and did all of that stuff  so i m used to certain formalities around certain things  i go to the introduction meeting, which is free, and i sat down in almost a church type setting  they welcome you and start explaining stuff  i m like,  okay, everything you re saying sounds great   they tell us the cost and i m like,  a little pricy, but if it s going to change my life   whatever  ''and then they re like,  by the way, on your first day i want you to bring three pieces of fruit and some flowers for the introduction to the dude and an offering you must give him on the table  we burn incense   i was like   and by the dude, you mean there s a large mural of the dude from the big lebowski ''kevin rose  that s right  no, it s the founder  i never recall the founder s name  maharishi?''kevin rose  maharishi, yes  so whatever  i m not going to buy in if it s any kind of religious thing  darya s making faces ''kevin rose  she is making faces  are we allowed to talk about this, by the way? this is the other thing, they told us we couldn t talk about any of this stuff  will they sue us?''tim ferriss  i don t think so  ultimately, this is a ringing endorsement of the benefits of tm, probably  but there is some weird stuff  let s call a spade a spade  and people have talked about it before ''kevin rose  yeah  basically, you go into a little room  swing a dead cat over your head 13 times  no, you don t do that  i m kidding ''kevin rose  you do your little ritual sacrifice thing  it s fine  i gave fruit  it lasts like 30 seconds  and then they give you a mantra  for people that don t know, there are a few different types of meditation  the type that i m used to is the head space variety, which is mindfulness  you sit there, you follow your breath, and your attention is directed at the in and out flow of your breath  that s kind of it ''mantra based meditation is taking a word that doesn t mean anything and you repeat it over and over and over in your head  you sit there for 20 minutes and you take this word   let s say it s cheeseburger   and you just think cheeseburger, cheeseburger, cheeseburger over and over  eventually, you enter this somewhat hypnotic state  did you find that s where it took you as well?''tim ferriss  it does  or it can, i should say  i m sure there are people who are experts in this who would take issue with this analogy, but you can think of it as almost a white noise machine for a waking state  so if you use a white noise machine to help you get to sleep, then this would be the equivalent for helping you achieve a sort of alpha brainwave level of relaxed attentiveness that some people might associate with flow  so it does help you get into a hypnotic state ''kevin rose  that s right  where i find it very helpful is, if you feel compelled when you ve attempted meditation in the past to swat your thoughts away as if they were flies buzzing in your face, it can get very frustrating  by repeating a mantra, you re effectively overriding a lot of the internal dialogue or monologue  but yes, you can get into a very, very altered state of sorts   an enhanced state ''kevin rose  yes  it s a four day training course and i did the first day  it was literally the fruit sacrifice and then the introduction of the mantra  by the way, the reason i said it s cheeseburger, cheeseburger is because they give you this mantra and you re not allowed to tell it to anyone  it s private, just for you  later, i looked them up online and there are 15 of them  so you can just guess which one mine is  it starts with an  m   i m just kidding  essentially, you do that, and then i was a little upset  i finished day one and i was like,  why did i really pay all of this money for this?  why do i have to say puttentang, puttentang?''kevin rose  i literally read it on the internet and i could just do it  i was like,  you know what? let s give them the benefit of the doubt   i went back for day two and it all made sense and i stayed for the entire four days  it s not   to be clear, when you say four days, it s like an hour or two a day ''kevin rose  yeah  i m talking about an hour and a half per day  day two through four is all about helping you get over the little hurdles that appear throughout the entire process  it sounds simple, but as you re doing the mantra certain things happen  i was doing the mantra and i started syncing the mantra with my heartbeat  i was like,  whoa, that s weird   so that distracted me and took me away from the mantra  i didn t know what to do and was kind of frozen ''imagine that, but probably 15 different things you will run into that are distractions  they teach you how to come back to the mantra, embrace that stuff, and that s where the value is  it s practical, tactical stuff, where there were two chief benefits   at least for me  you have someone holding you accountable to meditate for two sessions in between the inverse and meetings  there is a consequence (i e  embarrassment) to not performing the assigned work  when i tried meditation in the past, i d buy a book and i d be like,  90 percent of this makes no sense  i don t understand  but here s a little sidebar  fine, i ll follow my breath  ''i d do it and i d be like,  am i doing this right? i don t know  i had all of these thoughts  i m no good at this  i m losing at meditation  i quit  ''kevin rose  right  and after a few days, i would stop doing it  but when you have someone you re going to meet with each day who, in that hour and a half, is going to want to talk about your last two sessions, do post game analysis, and help you with the issues that came up, you feel compelled with social pressure of sorts ''kevin rose  yeah, it was great  and the costs, quite frankly  if i were to point to a benefit of the payment   although i hesitate to do that   you succumb to the sunk cost fallacy  you re like,  well, i already paid for it, i might as well do it  ''kevin rose  yeah  and i asked a ton of questions and got a lot of value out of it  it s been about a month and a half now  i ve been practicing and doing 40 minutes of meditation every day, seven days a week  two sessions, split into 20 minutes ''kevin rose  yes  my wife, darya says she notices a big difference  i don t know  i feel a little bit more relaxed  my pressure points are if too much is going on in my life   if i have a lot of travel combined with work combined with board meetings combined with fundraising   i hit a certain critical mass and i break down a little bit  it s just too much going on  why are you laughing?''tim ferriss  i m laughing because it just doesn t happen to anyone else  i don t know why you have this particular defect  i m joking  i missed you, too ''kevin rose  but seriously, that hasn t happened as much  i ve been able to weather the storm a lot better  i m not experiencing any type of effect other than i will do the meditation and i will come out of it in a slight daze  they tell you when you finish the 20 minute session to spend three minutes slowly reintroducing yourself to the world  it s like coming up from scuba diving  you have to equalize ''kevin rose  exactly  one time i didn t have that three minutes and i just got up and went, and i felt a little weird afterwards  the lady who was instructing me said,  actually, if that s going to happen and you know you have to go out to some place, cut back the meditation time and still spend that three minutes   you go pretty deep inside yourself and you re a little dazed  people can get headaches and all kinds of things if they come out too fast  darya is pointing to a shirt that she had printed for herself that says,  that s what she said  ''kevin rose  and that s why i married my wife  she makes those kinds of jokes  let s make it more concrete  we were just at dinner together and darya said you have been a rock in the best way possible, meaning very stable   a dramatic difference  for someone who is doing that type of work, it can be in some cases difficult to discern the progress  it s like if you re gaining half a pound of fat a month  a decade later, you re going to be pretty fat  but you won t notice it  ''kevin rose  like a year later, you d be pretty fat, too  that also  it s a terrible comparison, like the boiling frog, but you don t notice the improvement because you re exposed to it every day ''kevin rose  right  and i noticed a big change in my sleep  particularly the onset of sleep changed dramatically  i will be the first to admit i am not as consistent with afternoon sessions, so for me it s mostly first thing in the morning  this particular type of meditation is probably not for everyone, but it can be very useful for some people  i think the social accountability, the camaraderie, and the teacher student relationship were what was most important for me ''kevin rose  yeah  i do like the foundation they put in place  once you pay for the session   do you remember how much it was?  1,200 00 or something like that?''tim ferriss  something like that  the cost has decreased over time from  1,500 00 to  1,200 00 ''kevin rose  but you get to go back whenever you want  the teacher was like,  come back any time  you don t have to pay anything to hang out and i ll help you if you run into any more road blocks   they were really friendly people  let me give a couple of suggestions  the tm folks will probably hate me for this, but you can experiment with this using some type of mantra  i hate that term  i think it s very loaded  but you can use a word that is a two syllable word, like nature ''kevin rose  well, it s not supposed to mean anything, though  it s not supposed to mean anything, but let s not let perfect be the enemy  ''kevin rose  ohm is a very common mantra  you can use ohm also  for some people who are allergic to yoga like i was for a long time, they ll have negative associations  but you can use that  even though i do have a mantra, i ve used that exact example of nature ''kevin rose  what does your mantra start with?''tim ferriss  i am not going to tell you ''kevin rose  you can say the letter it starts with  i m going to lie to you  it starts with  z   i m such a hyper analytical person, i enjoy having a few superstitions i hold on to ''kevin rose  you drank the kool aid  you totally drank the kool aid  no, i also don t like using red pens for signing anything ''kevin rose  are you serious? who even has a red pen?''tim ferriss  yeah, i won t use red pens  i don t like cheersing with water ''kevin rose  i don t like cheersing with water, either  that s just weird  i m not doing it for a superstition reason  it just feels strange  so a couple of alternatives for people  ''darya   inaudible   no mic ''kevin rose  no, i m not  she was saying i m doing it for superstitious reasons  i just don t like the idea of everyone drinking alcohol and i don t have a glass of alcohol  no, it s not superstition  it s pure hard science ''kevin rose  i like alcohol  i want a glass of alcohol  okay, we won t belabor that  but for people who are interested in experimenting with this kind of thing, you can bootleg an imperfect variation of it and experiment  i do think people would derive benefit from it  but having someone who can answer very specific questions like,  you travel a lot  what are you going to do if room service knocks on the door and comes in while you re in the middle of meditation?  going through all of those contingencies is very valuable ''but you pointed out one   headspace has worked tremendously well for a lot of my friends and a lot of people listening to this for that matter ''kevin rose  calm is another one that has worked well  there are others who have enjoyed   and i ve enjoyed, frankly  i m not a purist about it  i ve used guided meditations from tara brach, who was introduced to me by maria popova of brain pickings  the guided meditations by tara brach are fantastic  she s also been on the podcast  sam harris has some great guided meditations  i think the website is samharris org  there are many options out there for starting your day off in a relaxed, nonreactive, calmly effective state  and those are some of the options ''kevin rose  yeah  i agree with you  i would say if you re going to try mantra based meditation, try to pair up with a friend or someone you know who has done it before  they can help you get over those hurdles  the nice thing about paying for the class is that it truly is a forcing function to make you take it seriously  i went to day two because i was kind of pissed  i was like,  why did i pay this much for it? i m going to get something out of it   after i went i actually got it  this is the way with all courses  it s true with a lot of skills, also, that are very frustrating in the beginning  let s take slacklining as an example ''kevin rose  oh god  i tried that at your house  slacklining is difficult, and most people completely lose interest and quit after the first and second sessions  neurologically, they re not capable of the neurological and muscular control and coordination  you need a certain  ''kevin rose  you saw me  it was like i was having seizures  yeah, so you require a certain number of sleep cycles, as far as i can tell, to consolidate this procedural knowledge  meditation, in this particular case, is very similar  it s like going out and snowboarding  i don t know anyone on the first day of snowboarding who was like,  that was so much fun   you just eat shit and catch edges and smash your head on the slopes   or your ass and tailbone   for the entire time ''kevin rose  right  in the world of meditation, that s where 95 plus percent of people quit  if they were forced to do five days, they would see the potential  they would have one good run and they would be like,  okay, now i m hooked  ''kevin rose  that s why i like to take 10 from head space, where they take 10 days for 10 minutes a day  that was the first time i got through all 10 days and i was like,  oh   it was about day eight when i got it  i was coming out of it more relaxed  i was feeling stronger as an individual after i did  anyway, we don t have to talk about meditation the entire time  the last thing i would say is it s very similar to physical training for non reactivity  if have been interested in the stoic philosophical episodes that have been on this podcast before related to seneca and a number of episodes by ryan holiday  training that type of non reactivity   meditation or mindfulness   mentally as you would train physically is a foundational skill that allows all the other pieces of the puzzle to function well  alright, what s next ''kevin rose  that was mine  what s yours?''tim ferriss  i ll give a couple of specifics  one is a fiction book that i just finished  i have almost always been a nonfiction snob  i ve taken a very hoity toity position with fiction, which was,  if i just want to make stuff up, i can do that myself  ''kevin rose  i feel the same way  i want to get something concrete out of a book ''kevin rose  i don t want to waste the time  if i m going to invest the time reading a book, it needs to be valuable, actionable, and have takeaways  i ve realized a few errors in that thinking  first, just as is the case with movies, there are movies or tv shows for entertainment, for stress relief   like dumb and dumber, which are brilliant in their own way  and then there are documentaries, like fog of war, you might watch to learn something ''i think it s very true with reading  you can better remember and incorporate some of the lessons from fiction because they are stories well told and we are programmed to be story remembering machines  the truths that are imbedded in fiction often are more utilitarian than the dense nonfiction that is just going to fall out of your brain like sand through the fingers  that s been my experience ''i ve actually realized that fiction can have not only a rejuvenating and relaxing effect by turning off your problem solving apparatus, but you can actually imbed truths that are helpful  one book that was recommended by our mutual friend chris sacca  he s been on this podcast and is on track to be   if not already   the most successful venture capitalist of all time based on his first fund ''the novel is how to get filthy rich in rising asia  i m blanking on the author s name  it s a pakistani author  it s a fascinating novel that is beautifully written  i ve never seen such incredibly glowing reviews of any book  it s just woven together in such a powerful way  it s unique because of the voice and perspective that is used  the entire book is written from first person  it s like you awake to pain in your left eye  you re laying down under your mother s cot with your head on the dirt ''kevin rose  oh, i like this  this sounds cool  i was told about this by chris, who  ''kevin rose  it sounds like a video game almost  it does  after chris told me about this, i thought to myself,  i should really read that   my second thought was,  that way of writing the book will be fascinating and cute for 10 pages and then it s going to drive me insane   it didn t at all  you just seamlessly become this character  i don t want to spoil it, but it s written as a parody of a self help book, which is awesome and hilarious  there is a lot of truth and timeless wisdom imbedded in this book ''kevin rose  is it on audible or just   oh, i m sure it is  thank you, darya  yeah, there we go  how to get filthy rich in rising asia by mohsin hamid ''kevin rose  the reason we re not getting our facts right is i have no internet at the house right now  darya s looking things up on her phone  right  and here s the quote in there  many liked this quote by michiko kakutani with the new york times,  audacious  hamid reaffirms his place as one of his generation s most inventive and gifted writers  ''it s a beautifully written book  if people are looking for a shift in the gears   perhaps a break from the relentless pursuit of dry facts, then i think this is a fantastic way to spend a few days  i got so into this, i read this book in maybe three days tops  i think it was two days, probably  i read it in a weekend  it s fantastic  so that would be the most recent read that i m into ''i ll bring up one other one that s really weird  maybe it s just an odd choice and an impulsive purchase  it s a book of poetry  i m not a poetry reader and i was in a barnes   noble at union square in new york city  there was a really thin collection of poetry sitting there called night sky with exit wounds  i think the author is ocean vuong ''kevin rose  that s a great title  it s fantastic  oh, that s what caught me  i m pretty sure the last name is vietnamese  i opened this book that s very small and i started reading one poem in the morning when i wake up and one at night  or, if i feel stressed, i use it just like i use fiction to short circuit the pro con hyper analytical, what if brain that can drive me completely bonkers  it works really well  i will warn people about something i didn t know  i don t think it would ve affected my purchase, but this author is very gay and very explicit  there is some pretty hardcore action in this book  if you re reading along and you re like,  whoa! hey now!  ''kevin rose  tim s into some crazy shit  that will probably happen a few times  some of the poems, i don t like at all, and that s okay  but every third or fourth i read   and this is a first for me   the wording is so evocative of unusual imagery  like the night sky with exit wounds   it twists my brain  it s almost like mental yoga  my brain struggles to piece together an image that makes sense  a lot of these poems don t seem to make a lot of sense, but there are four or five turns of phrase that stretch my ability to visualize in such a way that i find it just opens doors to perception or gives me other lenses through which i can view the rest of my day ''kevin rose  sweet  it sounds odd, i know, but i ve never really read or pursued poetry in this way  it was a very impulsive purchase based on chancing across this book  i think it s going to reignite my interest in certain types of poetry, like those that were introduced to me by rolf potts, the writer and author of vagabonding, one of my favorite books  that s a to be continued  i don t think i will become a poet  i don t have the hubris to think i have the capacity for that, but also the way this book is formatted is so odd ''as someone who is accustomed to narrative fiction or nonfiction, the words will be scattered around the page for one poem and then the next will be an unbroken paragraph of text with no punctuation  it s just so jolting that i find it serves as a pattern interrupt for me ''kevin rose  it s almost like art, in a way  totally ''kevin rose  you re getting a little piece of art on every page  it absolutely is  that has been an interesting, unintended experiment of mine recently ''kevin rose  that s awesome  another is that i am going to be, as promised, donating at least  100,000 to psychedelic research at top universities this year, 2016  i ve already raised  90 something thousand for johns hopkins and the use of psilocybin for treatment resistant depression  that s depression that has not been addressable by any traditional means  i m going to be doing more work in funding research ''thank you for everybody who contributed to that campaign  it was a huge success  things are already underway  i m very excited about what will be discovered that can be used in that trial ''kevin rose  give me the quick 30 seconds for people who aren t familiar with this  what is the trial? what are you testing? i get that it s depression that can t be treated with anything else  but what does the actual trial look like? what do they receive?''tim ferriss  if people want to read all of the details, they can go to crowdrise com timferriss  the trial has actually been upgraded  it will be relatively small sample size  i m pulling this from memory, but i think it will be six to 12 people ''kevin rose  can i be one of the   unfortunately, not, unless you want to move to baltimore and fill out a very long questionnaire and qualify for it  but the purpose is to determine whether a single, or several, administrations of standardize psilocybin   i m guessing 0 25 to 0 35 milligrams per kilograms, which would translate to what would generally be considered heroic dose  if i get this wrong, you can go to my blog and leave a comment and let me know ''we want to see the measurable effects and persistence of effects of psilocybin in patients who have not responded   chronic depression that has not been addressable or treatable with other pharmaceutical or therapeutic means  they will be also using fmri and other imaging tools to try to determine if there is a demonstrable and statistically significant effect, how psilocybin has this particular effect ''there is good science and more science on the way to indicate that there are some incredibly powerful applications of psilocybin, for instance in the treatment of different kinds of addiction  it can t be used for everything, but in terms of nicotine addiction or alcoholism, it s tremendously effective   at least based on the preliminary data we have thus far ''kevin rose  when you re administering this psilocybin to someone   can i finish one thing?''kevin rose  yeah, yeah  go for it  the purpose of me bringing it up was not to say,  hey, guys  i m donating a bunch of money to psilocybin  please give me a gold star   it was to say that i m doing a second campaign  instead of using crowdfunding, i want to run an experiment  i want to figure out not only what works or doesn t work in the scientific arena with these compounds, but what are the most effective nontraditional ways of fundraising for scientific studies ''i ve already designed and will be selling a number of themed t shirts that should be available by the time you hear this  you can check those out by going to fourhourworkweek com mushroom, which is traditionally where one finds psilocybin  it s not in all mushrooms, so don t go out foraging  that s a good way to get dead  i m curious to see if merchandising is a more efficient way to raise  100,000 for scientific research than crowdfunding  in turn, i will compare those to the usual approach, which is a director of development of a university or nonprofit has a dinner at someone s house where they invite a bunch of muckety mucks and they have a one on one conversations infused with a lot of wine to convince people to donate money ''kevin rose  everyone gives  25,000 and that s what you hope for  or you try to land a whale  i want to see if there are more elegant ways of doing that ''kevin rose  the t shirt looks pretty cool  you re wearing it now and it s fantastic  yeah  it s very comfortable  i spent a disturbing amount of time picking out the materials for these shirts  i m a real stickler  i ve seen some shirts i would ve been totally down to wear   from say south by southwest, where every startup is giving away free shirts  that s generally a waste of money, by the way  but some of them are so comfortable that i ve worn ridiculous shirts just because they re a good material ''kevin rose  they always give you extra large, though  but they give you extra large muumuu shirts with a 20 by 20 inch logo that makes the front all stick and plastic  who is going to wear that?''kevin rose  yeah  you tried to cut corners to make a minimally expensive shirt and as a result you wasted all of it  you spent  2 00 a shirt  ''kevin rose  it s more like  10 00, but yeah  you spent  10 00 a shirt  you did 1,000 shirts because you didn t want to spend  15,000  and now that  10,000 is going to be entirely wasted because no one is going to wear it  you could ve just spent 50 percent more and actually have some measurable roi of some type  it s a pet peeve  i fucking hate it  i have no fashion sense  i wear a lot of t shirts  i think a lot of about t shirt comfort ''kevin rose  i have a question about mushrooms  yes?''kevin rose  the typical college kevin that has experience with mushrooms is you get a chocolate, you get a bag, or something like that  when you do these trials, how do they measure this stuff? are they grinding up mushrooms and weighing them out? how do they actually administer   my understanding is that it s synthesized  it would be extracted, but this is actually one of the largest constraints, with a compound that is as tracked and regulated as plutonium   it s scheduled in the same class as cocaine and heroin  so it is extremely difficult to get the approvals on many different levels, including irb for human trials, to initiate this type of research  i need experts here for accuracy, but for the sake of argument, let s just say you get all of the approvals ''you want to get five grams of psilocybin, it s something crazy like  15,000 a gram to get a hold of it because there are no economies of scale ''kevin rose  who s growing it? it s not being grown, it s all synthesized  synthesized or extracted   i don t know specifically  there is a nonprofit called usona which has purchased a very large quantity so they can then distribute at cost to researchers  it s a brilliant approach and they re doing this all through legitimate, legal means  they have all the necessary clearances  it removes the largest constraints currently, which is capital ''universities have fundraising and it has to be allocated  if you have a six person study and it s going to cost an additional  50,000  100,000, even if all of your research is well planned and all of the proper boxes checked, if you don t have the money, you don t have the money  so this will in part remove that limitation  it should greatly improve the number of researchers who are performing studies using psilocybin, which is very exciting ''kevin rose  that s great  the first time i read about it being used in research was probably about six to eight months ago  there was a study done in new york  this kid that was studying to become a doctor came down with cancer and he was having absolutely horrible anxiety ''he knew how to check himself because he was premed  he was rubbing his lymph nodes all the time and freaking out, to the point where the doctors were like,  you need to stop rubbing your lymph nodes   he was causing rashes  he went off the deep end  they had this study and he took part  he swallowed these capsules of psilocybin and knocked out his anxiety 100 percent  even though he still had stage four cancer, he was just okay with dying at that point  this is one of the areas that is very active  it s end of life anxiety or depression for, in instance, terminal cancer patients  there is a very good article written some time ago by michael pollan called the trip treatment ''it was in the new yorker and is very much worth reading  it talks a good deal about this  that is one type of study that i will be funding more of  there are actually two on deck  it is very important to fund studies that are easily defended at this nascent stage of research, with a very unfairly scheduled compound  you have to really be on the up and up and on the best behavior, and have as many assurances and insurances as possible, to ensure you can defend this study scientifically and politically  these particular populations in the early stages are important to choose wisely ''it s very hard to say,  fuck the cancer patient who s going to die  let that guy have incredible anxiety and depression   it s very hard to attack that  similarly, i find it very compelling to look at the treatment resistant depression, something that has not responded to other medical options to date, or veterans with ptsd ''kevin rose  don t you feel like you could use marijuana as a template here? they ve been very successful at creating cannabis related compounds to treat and help cancer patients with pain and other things  that was kind of the foot in the door strategy to open the door to further research other things  potentially  i ve spoken with some people who have had very deep involvement on the political legislative side with cannabis  i do think there are lessons to be learned   both things to do and not to do  so that s something i ve continued to be very passionate about ''kevin rose  sweet  if you want some super comfy t shirts that ll make your nipples hard in a good way, go to fourhourworkweek com mushroom  one is very subtle  one is not so subtle  you can decide if you want to support some team colors  all of the proceeds, 100 percent, are going to directly to research  that is something i m very much looking forward ''kevin rose  awesome  i have one quick little book and then we can move into the q a  does that sound good?''tim ferriss  let s do it ''kevin rose  the book i m halfway through right now   and i hate to recommend something i m only halfway through, but i m really enjoying it  it s called moonwalking with einstein  have you read it?''tim ferriss  i haven t, but i know a good deal about it  joshua foer?''kevin rose  yes  he was a writer that was covering national memory champions  so he was assigned this beat and he thought he was going to write a single article about these memory champions and then he got pulled into actually performing and learning the tricks of the trade to become a memory champion  now memory champion includes things like memorizing the order of the cards in a shuffled deck ''kevin rose  that s right  or an unpublished poem handed to you, and names and faces of 50 some people  they hand you these cards with names and faces and you get a minute to memorize all of the   i think digistrings, maybe?''kevin rose  yeah, you use random strings of digits  it s insane stuff that for someone like me, who has a really horrible memory, to be attracted to this book  where i m at right now, they talk about this idea of a memory palace  do you know much about this?''tim ferriss  i know all about it  the loci technique ''kevin rose  yeah  give your take on it  i m curious  i used to be really into this stuff  also, ed cook, who is the coach in moonwalking with einstein is a very close friend of mine ''kevin rose  no way! that s amazing  he has been on the podcast, talking about memory stuff ''kevin rose  are you serious? how did i miss that episode? that s awesome  he s great  we did it when i was on the west coast and he was in london, so he had plenty of booze  it was great  he s a hilarious brit to start with ''kevin rose  they talk about him drinking in the episode and going out   oh, it s not joke ''kevin rose    and using it to hit on girls and stuff, by memorizing  ed is hilarious  you should definitely check out the episode  memory palace has been used for ages in one form or another in many different cultures  it s also called the loci technique, which means location  the way it s used is very simple ''you have a predetermined location or route that you re familiar with and you can then, in the process of giving yourself a tour of this location in a predetermined say clockwise fashion around the perimeter of the inside of a concert hall, or walking from your front door to your favorite coffee shop where you pass 16 different buildings and a bunch of different landmarks, you can place items that you want to remember along that route in a particular order ''kevin rose  right  and that allows you to do some very interesting things  not only can you remember things by using imagery   which we re very visual creatures   you can also recall them out of order  i used to do this as a party trick in college  i was a neuroscience major, and for a very brief flash in time, i was very interested in how to stretch the capacity of cognition  you can take the abstract and convert it into the concrete, ideally in the form of images  you can do that with numbers ''for instance, you can take the numbers from one to one hundred, convert the numbers zero to nine into specific letters  so let s just say zero is  s  or  z   one is  t  or  d,  which both have one down stroke  three is  m,  three down strokes  four is  r,    the last letter is r  and then let s just say you decide well in advance that 12, as an example, is tn  anytime you have a 12, it s automatically tn  maybe that s the tin man ''so let s just say you have a route from your front door to your coffee shop and somebody gives you a one dollar bill, a five dollar bill, a ten, and a twenty  you say,  okay, i m going to memorize the serial code numbers on all of these and give them back to you  i would take pairs of numbers and go in fours  my first stop   i walk out the door and there s a yellow fire hydrant  that s the first landmark that i pass  if the first four numbers are like 1270   i m making that up ''seven is a  k  and zero is an  s  or a  z,  like i said  so 1270  so tn   i have tin man  70   kz would be one  kz i associate with this guy named bill kazmaier, who was the world s strongest man champion for ages  he s a complete beast  i know what he looks like  so now i have the tin man and kazmaier fighting around this yellow fire hydrant  now i have four numbers  i can move on to the next one  by doing that, you can get to the point very quickly where you re memorizing 100 plus random numbers at a time  it s really incredible ''kevin rose  so i ll give you my very first exercise in the book  it s the same idea  this time you picture your childhood house  everyone tends to know their childhood house pretty well   or a location you know quite well and have lived there for a long time  they start you off at the sidewalk right by your mailbox  so you think you re going to put an item down right there  in this case, he wants you to memorize 15 different items on a grocery shopping list ''the first thing is pickled garlic  so you put a glass of pickled garlic right there, when you re walking in, right on the corner  you visualize the glass  you visualize how it tastes in your mouth, the logo on the outside, the type of screw down cap that it has   and the more connections you can make to how it feels and how it tastes, the stronger the reinforcement is in your brain  so that is one location ''so just like you, the next one up is by your garage door or the front door  the next one is inside the house or in your kitchen or whatever comes next  you pick these 10 different locations and you place one object down at each location  sure enough, i can go back days later and tell you exactly where the pickled garlic was  almost anyone can do this  if you use the same location over and over and over again, i found there was a fair amount of interference and i would get confused because i would recall something i had already put in this specific place  if i was sitting in the equivalent of a bar on princeton s campus hanging out with somebody and they re like,  i heard you do some weird memory shit   it s like,  dance for me, monkey   and i d be like,  okay  ''so i would actually look around the room i was sitting in and i would place the images around the room  it was so unique a signature and frame that i would see the person two or three days later and i d be like,  hey, do you still have that five in your wallet?  i d quote the serial code backwards and they d be like,  what?!  people can get to that level of proficiency within a week or two of practice  it s not complicated ''kevin rose  anyway, this is a great book  i m enjoying it so far  if you re looking to improve your memory, there are a bunch of little tricks they re starting to unveil about halfway through the book  it s been a fun read and it s also on audible  that s how i got it  i ve heard great things about it  there is another book for those of you who want a compliment that i found extremely helpful  i haven t seen the book in 20 years, but i think the author is higbee  your memory and how to improve it ''kevin rose  cool  i ll check that one out as well  that is a tremendous resource  in my sophomore year, all of the recreational reading i did was related to pneumonic devices and studying this type of   some people call it artificial enhancement of memory ''kevin rose  that is so funny  i didn t even know this when i sat down  you didn t know i was going to bring this book up  i had no idea  there is another book that is just basically a description of a super mind called mind of mnemonist by a j  luria  it talks about synesthesia and all of this crazy, rainman like abilities and beyond  i thought it was very inspiring, but it also highlighted that, when you have those types of gifts, it s often a very mixed bag  you have a lot of issues ''kevin rose  yeah, they bring that up a lot in this book  they walk through a couple of profiles of individuals that have had more or less perfect memories  it s very daunting not to be able to forget certain things  it actually has really bad   you want to be able to forget certain things  we re built to forget certain things  it shows the consequences there, and they re not pretty  no, they re not  that s why, when i look at technology and living in silicon valley as i do, and the perspective of memory enhancement using technological means   i think there is a lot of promise in developing some of these technologies  they re well into development at this point ''kevin rose  are you talking about  '' crosstalk  no, i m not talking about tdcs   the transcranial direct current stimulation ''kevin rose  that sounds right  no, i ve experimented with that ''kevin rose  have you?''tim ferriss  i have ''kevin rose  gosh, we could just keep going on and on  we need to get to q a  yeah, we ll do q a  and if you guys want to talk more about cognitive enhancement and memory, we can certainly do that ''kevin rose  we do should do  '' crosstalk  actually, i have another recommendation for people  have you guys seen black mirror?''kevin rose  no  oh my god ''kevin rose  i saw black swan  wait, i did see   you mean, the little miniseries?''tim ferriss  the miniseries that s like the twilight zone based on technology ''kevin rose  yeah  the first one was just kind of like   look, the first one is creepy and gross  but i really enjoyed it  there are some very good episodes ''kevin rose  i watched the one where the president s daughter gets kidnapped or whatever  yeah, i think that s the first one  it s a mind trip, but there s one episode about a not too distant future where you can replay memories because your waking reality is being recorded through your eye  you can replay them, project them for people, rewind, search for certain things   i don t think we re that far away ''kevin rose  that s crazy  but it definitely highlights some of the risks involved with that ''kevin rose  it could be amazing, but it also could be really horrible  i think it will be both  alright  q a ''kevin rose  let s do it  you want to take a stab first?''kevin rose  i want to start first  this is kind of fun  i get to interview you on your podcast  i guess the random show is our shared show, but this is more or less your channel  what is one illegal substance that you ve tried that has changed you for the better?''tim ferriss  got tim tim on this one  psilocybin ''kevin rose  psilocybin? that s your number one?''tim ferriss  i had a number of very transformative and formative experiences with psilocybin that were the tipping point for certain decisions and reprogramming ''kevin rose  what did it do for you? clearly, as mentioned just a few minutes ago with the research you want to do, something happened and it changed you  what was the change?''tim ferriss  i would say i ve always been a worrier  i ve always had a fair degree of anxiety, which is not uncommon among a type personalities ''kevin rose  this is me to the tee right now  i heard at one point   and i want to know the attribution on this, so somebody please let us know  hit us up on twitter ''kevin rose   ferriss   this expression i heard and rang so true to me was,  anxiety is being trapped in the future and depression is being trapped in the past   so if you re a planner and a control freak, what are you doing? you re constantly planning  what if this? what if that? contingency a  contingency b  it s makes you a fucking stress case ''kevin rose  dude, that s me  and it manifests in different ways  some people get angry  some people start losing their temper  other people develop physical symptoms   gi discomfort, acid reflux, or whatever it might be ''kevin rose  i ve had it all big time  my experience is that sufficient dose   and this is something you really need to do with proper supervision  i m not just saying that as ass covering, liability lip service  there are many cases of people using psychedelics in the wrong circumstances and dying  you can make very bad decisions   step out in front of traffic, jump out of a window  there are many different ways you can horribly injure or kill yourself if this is not used in a responsible way ''kevin rose  but not from overdosing psilocybin, right?''tim ferriss  no, it s from making very poor decisions because you think you can fly or something ''kevin rose  or drive your car or something stupid  all terrible ideas  you need proper supervision  but with all of those caveats, let s use a comparison  i think we ve all had the experience of opening up a computer and you have 30 tabs open  you re running out of storage  i m looking at kevin s computer right now  it looks just like mine  you have 30 tabs open   warning, startup disk almost full  oh shit  what do i do? and then dropbox is syncing  why is my computer running so slow? oh, slack s also on  it s like,  why is my system so goddamn slow?  oh, the antivirus is on ''kevin rose  you have antivirus on a mac?''tim ferriss  i don t  for me, a moderate to high dose of psilocybin serves as a hard reboot  it just cleans that entire system, flushes the cache, and allows me to regain a 30,000 foot view  sanity in view of larger pictures and my most important priorities   and remove all of that noise  the anxiolytics   the anxiety decreasing and depression suppressing effect for me, the first time i used it, lasted three to six months  it was unbelievable how persistent it was ''kevin rose  wow  i would say that is my answer ''kevin rose  that s fascinating  good answer  thanks  i m going to ask a few questions that i don t think i got around to asking the first time ''kevin rose  alright  when you hear the word successful, who is the first person who comes to mind and why?''kevin rose  i would probably say philip rosedale  okay  who is philip and why?''kevin rose  he created second life virtual world way back in the day  i have interviewed him on my show foundation  back in the day, i had a podcast called foundation  you can still find it  i think it s foundation bz  the reason that i like him is on a couple of fronts  i feel that he is a very creative person that fully accepts risk and goes in headfirst  he is willing to try really wild and crazy ideas and really doesn t care if they fail  he has done that throughout his career and has been very successful at it ''i really admire people that aren t afraid of failure and are willing to try big, bold things  elon musk would be an easy answer on this front because he s trying so many really cool, big, bold ideas  the founders of google are another example ''kevin rose  yeah, but i   i think it was larry page that said one of the things people miss is that, if you aim big enough it s very hard to fail completely  you take something from it or learn lesson that you can then parlay into the next thing that s successful ''kevin rose  the problem i have with the founders of google   i ve had the pleasure of meeting these guys and i think they re   i m not knocking them at all  they re really brilliant and have created an amazing organization that continues to do great work  the reason i like philip and picked him over the founders of google   you re mad about your adsense account ''kevin rose  they banned my adsense account  no, seriously, it s because philip has these ideas that are just so crazy  you ll have to go back and listen to my other podcast about how to manage people and projects and get group think to come together and create beautiful things  they re kind of out of this world ideas and i m attracted to that  for some reason, i like the really crazy thinkers  i just had jason fried on my podcast that i do for the journal  he has created an amazing start up  we were talking about the culture he creates in his company  he said,  i want to pay people for getting eight hours of sleep   and he wants to track that ''you come in with your fitbit, you open your account and it shows you slept a full eight hours and you get paid a bonus  that s amazing  he really cares about how he can take care of the entire life cycle of an individual in ways he s never heard about before  those are the types of ideas that aren t just,  how can we create a better browser? how can we create a self driving car?  they re just   i m smirking because i was thinking with a fitbit you could try to pay people for having an hour of sex a day  it has an accelerometer  it could figure it out  you d have to wear a belt while you were boning, i guess  darya s question was,  where would you attach it?  no, that s true ''kevin rose  there could be a fitbit cock ring or something  seriously, let me say one last thing on this topic and then we can move on  the butterfly ''kevin rose  you ve got my head all messed up now  i think that in being a venture capitalist in silicon valley for so many years, we see the same pitches over and over  you see modifications of,  hey, i m the uber for this  i m the twitter for that  i m the myspace for this   it s just the incremental youtube also around stuff ''kevin rose  it s the peter thiel true zero to one jump   those big ideas that are new and beautiful and ugly and scary, that you find them so rarely in founders  i like those types of founders, so that s why he came to mind  phil rosedale has a tremendous amount of stamina  he s been in the game for a long time  he knows how to modulate  he s been very consistent ''kevin rose  big time meditator, too  he invented his own form of meditation  i m not joking  what characterizes it?''kevin rose  he counts to like 10,000 a day  he does mantra based meditation based on counting  just single digits? 1, 2, 3  ''kevin rose  yeah  we were sitting there and he was like,  yeah, i m at 587 right now   wait  he does it  ''kevin rose  every day  no, no  as he s doing other activities? oh, my god  that sounds difficult ''kevin rose  he doesn t stop to do it  he ll have like three minutes  he ll be on a conference call and he s at like 6,737 ''kevin rose  right, and then he stops and he goes   and if he has a minute he does an extra 100  oh, he picks up ''kevin rose  yeah  that sounds so stressful ''kevin rose  it totally does for me, but it works for him  whatever works ''kevin rose  next question  it s after midnight now  if you could change any law, what would it be  and you can t say drugs  let me think about this for a second ''kevin rose  is there anything that just drives you nuts and you re like,  why is that a law?  you have to have some political somewhere   i do  i ve gone through this recently  i ve been told i m a libertarian  i don t know if that s true or not  i think that there are laws   and perhaps all laws should be revisited and reassessed on occasion ''there are certain laws that are put in place to, in the best cases, create the greatest good for the greatest number of people in circumstances that then change  for instance, i m building a barrel sauna and it s relatively small  it looks like a gigantic wine barrel  it s based on plans that were given to me by rick rubin, who got them from laird hamilton  it s an incredible set up ''it s surprisingly inexpensive  and to put that on my own property, out of view of any neighbors, was just like trying to broker a fucking peace treaty between north and south korea ''kevin rose  why did you tell your neighbors?''tim ferriss  no, no  it has nothing to do with my neighbors  it has everything to do with getting city and town permits and all of that kind of stuff ''kevin rose  no, don t do that  just do it yourself  just don t do it? no, no, no  you have to do that  in any case, this is just one example  i m generally a small government guy  i really feel like, if you look at for instance crises or natural disasters   in earthquakes, in the blitz where london was being bombed in world war ii, people develop social structures and rules that keep the peace and assign roles to different types of people and create order amongst themselves ''now, i m not an anarchist  i m not saying the government shouldn t exist  but i do think that we ve edged too far into a nanny state type of dependency that is not a healthy dependency whatsoever  it s created a stifling environment for certain things   whether it is this barrel sauna or hiring really good non us citizens to work at your startup ''kevin rose  that s a big issue  i know a lot of icons in silicon valley have been working on it, but why is this so hard? it is completely ludicrous  especially based in a country where the blend of cultures and innovation we have is directly a consequence of massive immigration  it s outrageous  in any case, that s my rant  if i could change any law   nothing super specific ''kevin rose  the sauna laws  i need to provide more money to the sauna lobby ''kevin rose  do a fundraiser for the sauna law and get a t shirt  i m sure i could come up with a better answer if i thought more about it  oh, here s one  i think that it should be easier for a loved one to take their loved one off of life support, or provide ethical euthanasia in cases where that has been sort of prearranged  i don t think the state should have a say in that  i think if that is something that has been documented and agreed upon beforehand, that should be an option in more circumstances ''kevin rose  yeah  sucks to see people suffer  yeah ''kevin rose  alright, what s my question?''tim ferriss  these are pretty short ones  what is the book or books that you ve gifted most to other people?''kevin rose  number one would be miracle of mindfulness  that s thich nhat hanh ''kevin rose  right  have you ever read that book?''tim ferriss  it s a great book ''kevin rose  yeah, it s great  it was the one that really got me into mindfulness and applying it to everyday life  there is a story in there where he talks about washing the dishes to wash the dishes  yeah, instead of thinking about the plum that you re going to eat after the dishes ''kevin rose  exactly  it s such a good anecdote, though  i know ''kevin rose  the point being, if you re thinking about the plum when you re washing the dishes, when you re eating the plum you re going to be thinking about your fucking email or whatever it is  his whole thing is we should be in the moment and focusing on the task at hand, putting our full attention on that, and really living that moment  this is just a great short read  you can pick it up on amazon for like  12 00  it s not an expensive book and it s one of my favorites when it comes to mindfulness  what s second place?''kevin rose  just because of doing the whole social internet thing in the early days, i would say wisdom of crowds was a big one for me  that meant a lot to me and there are still some great little tidbits in there  green eggs and ham?''kevin rose  i think those are probably my top two  fantastic  since i gave a longwinded answer, i ll give you some air time and i ll ask another question  a purchase of  100 00 or less that has positively impacted your life ''kevin rose  i hate to plug my other podcast, but on episode two i went out and interviewed this guy that is a master of pens  he knows more about pens than we do about anything else on earth  he recommended three pens that have the absolute best rollerball pen, the best fountain pen   and these are all  4 00 pens  some of them are really hard to find  some you can only find in japan  that s convenient ''kevin rose  but you can find them online  i swapped out my entire stock of pens at my desk with these cheap little  3 00 to  4 00 pens and they re amazing  do you recall the names of any of them?''kevin rose  yes, i can put them in your show notes  i will get his top there and they ll be in the show notes  alright  we ll put these in the show notes, guys  fourhourworkweek com podcast   you can find show notes for this and all of the other episodes ''kevin rose  but i think for me that represents who i am as a person  i like to geek out on something and go really deep  i think you re like this, too  i m definitely like this, too ''kevin rose  you find something you re into and i m like,  really? there s a better pen? tell me more   and we ended up having a 30  or 40 minute podcast about notebooks and pens  that was super geeky, but i have some awesome notebooks now  i dig pens  i have a bit of a pen fetish myself, so this is right up my alley ''kevin rose  the next question for you   what is one body experiment you wish you didn t do?''tim ferriss  one physical experiment that i wish i didn t partake in  ''kevin rose  you can t mention the double circumcision  i m sorry i did that to toaster  i do regret that  sorry, toasty ''kevin rose  he s still in pain  good boy  the one that comes to mind is   i was in cape town, south africa, doing research related to a number of chapters in the 4 hour body  i was getting muscle biopsies, which involve having something the side of a large pen stabbed into the side of your leg to cut muscle tissue out   not super comfy  that one i don t regret  that got me a lot of really interesting enzymatic information related to endurance and a muscle fiber analysis  i was at the sports science institute of south africa and dr  timothy noakes is there  he s incredibly well versed in the worlds of ultra endurance and hydration, or lack thereof, and how the body responds to different states of hydration ''i wanted to do a very well established running test  it was going to be an endurance test, which i m not known for to start with  i decided that i could use every advantage possible and i had read in a number of places that resveratrol, which most people associate with longevity  ''kevin rose  the red wine compound  the excuse they use to drink red wine, when in reality you d have to have like 72 cases a day to get the therapeutic dose used in clinical  resveratrol also has some incredible implications for endurance  i remember seeing this video   i believe it was super rat  there was normal rat and then super rat running on a treadmill  i want to say it was david sinclair, perhaps, who did this ''kevin rose  and they gave super rate resveratrol  it s endurance doubled  it s run time to exhaustion doubled  i said,  okay, well let me look at the research and figure out the dosage they used on the rats   the milligrams per kilograms   and then i  ''kevin rose  oh my god  you ratted yourself  i ordered like five months  worth of resveratrol   like multiple bottles ''kevin rose  oh no  don t do this at home, kids   i consumed all of the bottles  i had to consume something like 120 capsules to get the proper milligrams per kilogram ''kevin rose  why would you do this? this is dumb  there are a couple off issues, folks, for those of you who haven t realized this is dumb yet  i couldn t figure out a way to expeditiously have this administered through injection, which is almost certainly how it was given to these rats  they didn t feed the rats resveratrol chow, i m pretty sure  they most likely injected it intramuscularly or intravenously  i didn t have that as an option, so i did it orally ''well, there are a bunch of issues that come up here  i ll just flash forward and give you guys a snapshot and then explain what happened  i m sitting there in this meeting and there was a serious, brilliant, hilarious guy sitting there  he s like explaining this very seriously to me and it s like a 10 minute intro to what i m about to do  out of nowhere, i start sweating fucking bullets   a cold sweat ''kevin rose  how many pills did you take at this point?''tim ferriss  oh, i had all of them a half hour beforehand  i had 90 or 120 capsules ''kevin rose  so you re drinking like 10 at a time and gulping them down  oh, yeah  i m good at swallowing pills  i get this profuse cold sweat out of nowhere pouring down my face  he s giving me this very serious speech and i m trying to pay attention because the sweat s coming into my eyes  he s like,  are you okay? ''kevin rose  you re like,  i need a hamster wheel stat   i was like,  do you have a bathroom nearby   he points me down the hallway and i do the butt squeeze waddle down the hallway and do a reverse bra jump through the stall and just stay there for the next 45 minutes  i didn t realize   what was not listed on the ingredient list on these pills   there s something used as a filler called imoden, and imoden acts as a laxative  i was just a disaster  needless to say, it completely killed my endurance  i did the running test  it was 10 times worse than it would ve been if i had not swallowed 120 pills ''kevin rose  you probably like lost a ton of water and   oh, it was a complete disaster  so that was  ''kevin rose  you re lucky you didn t have some crazy, horrible side effect like   yeah  look, i don t recommend mimicking that behavior, but to the extent possible i did do my homework  i read a lot on pubmed  i knew there was a risk that i would have gi distress, i just didn t know that it would be like  ''kevin rose  that severe    exorcist style out the other end type of issue  live and learn  i saw a t shirt here in new york city  it said bad decisions make good stories, so i guess this is one of those examples ''kevin rose  there you go  what advice would you give to your 20  or 25 year old self? place us where you are and what you re doing ''kevin rose  i don t know whether i should go 20 or 25  let s go 25  right around that time was when i was creating digg for the first time  it exploded and got a bunch of users and we grew the company to a pretty decent size  the issue was, at that age, i was still really immature  if i would sit down with my younger self, i would say to that person to seek out mentors and stop acting like you know it all  when i didn t know something, i refused to learn it  i wanted to focus on what i already knew i was good at ''i was really good at the creative side and coming up with new feature ideas and product ideas, but when it came down to hiring staff or interviewing folks   all of the other pieces of business you have to learn in order to succeed   i didn t have any of that  rather than admit i didn t know it, i just turned a blind eye to it  that caused a lot of problems later ''i was like,  okay, i m going to focus on this small domain and hire other people to take over my weak spots   i first of all didn t know how to hire the right folks  we hired some great people, but gave the keys to the castle to folks rather than taking on the hard work, which was admitting i didn t know these things and putting in the time and effort to become proficient in them  that s what i d go back to that 25 year old self with ''it s a lot of the stuff that i m still learning today  as a fourth or fifth time entrepreneur having a startup, i m putting in a lot of time and effort  i feel like i m mature enough now at almost 40  if i don t know something, i immediately go and say,  who is the smartest person in the room? who can point me in the right direction so i can get schooled on this   it s important  you can t just shuffle that stuff to the side and let an ego get in the way when it shouldn t be  that makes perfect sense  the short term ego pain prevents the long term catastrophic pain ''kevin rose  right  exactly  and it only happens once  you have that small little bash to your ego for 10 minutes, but you get introduced to the right folks and you admit that you don t know something  and guess what, that never comes up again  you can go and get schooled up on that  that s good advice  what is the worst advice that you hear being thrown around to startup founders, or in general? what is some bad advice that s given frequently?''kevin rose  well, i ve seen many a startup that believes that when they have a little bit of traction it s the time to go raise a bunch of capital and spend into that and hope for the best ''oftentimes, you see a lot of bloat created and a lot of extra pressure to hit certain milestones that don t make sense and then cause you to make really bad short term decisions for the business to bring in revenue when it s not going to help in the long term  there are bunch of examples i can give here and i don t want to pick on any one individual company  that said, let me pick on one company  when people are like,  i don t want to be an asshole, but,  that usually means they re immediately going to be an asshole ''kevin rose  i know  there s that great onion article that says the devil s advocate turns out to be just a big asshole  i love that article  it s so true  side note   i heard this comedian say,  when someone says,  i m a taxpayer,  it means they re about to be an asshole  ''kevin rose  totally  a great example of this is a company like fab com  i was an angel investor there  it had a great founder and a great seed of an idea   it was a great pivot from the site they were before into a very design oriented e commerce play  it had a great following and was doing   the conversions on these little flash tails were working quite well  they went out and raised several monster rounds, hired a bunch of employees, and just spent into this business and blew through a bunch of capital ''when the novelty wore off, the business went away  that said, growing thoughtfully and in line, in track, and in parallel with your revenue, and being more responsible around that makes a lot of sense  don t over raise capital and spend too much cash up front  i think we re getting better at that as an industry  i think there has been enough fires now that people can see that s not the wisest way to go ''that said, we still see things like uber and others that are just raising monster amounts of cash  but the good news is that they have real revenue to back it up  i think this was very much a thing when you don t have the revenue and you re going and doing this   it s a bad decision  also, if we re looking at fab versus uber, the fab example is very different in the respect that it s not necessarily a winner take all market where they have to dominate a city or a country or a continent to become the de facto choice for ridesharing  there are certain network effects, or marketplace dynamics, where if they have the most drivers then they ll have the most riders  the riders want to have the fastest pick up time  if they have the most riders, then they ll be able to recruit the most drivers ''it s a virtuous cycle for the person who owns the most market share on both sides of that equation  but in a fab case, or many cases like it, there are a lot of perverse incentives at play  there are particularly perverse incentives at play in an environment like we are either just coming out of or still in  there are many people who would disagree with this, and i don t have issues with smaller examples  but there are startups that are on their way to failure and the founders know  they take a ton off the table, the employees see nothing, and then it just craters ''kevin rose  right  that is a byproduct of being able to raise these monster rounds, in part   riding momentum of i bonds as opposed to revenue  that s one of the reasons i got dismayed and disillusioned with a lot of the exchanges  they re certainly not long term relationship building, but a lot of the transactional exchanges that happens in that startup eco system  ''kevin rose  there are a lot of positives to taking venture capital  one of the negatives is that the founders are pushed to build a bigger and bigger business  for example, when i first launched digg, i launched it as just a tech only news site  it quickly became the largest tech news site in the world  there was no doubt we had more traffic than any   at the time, cnet was big and a couple of other blogs ''but when a certain amount of dollars came to the table, it was like,  hey, what we love what you re doing with digg as a tech site  why don t you go into world news and politics and science and all of these other categories?  so we did that  and then that was great and we had 38 million people a month coming to our site   but wouldn t it be great if you could get to 50 100 million people coming to your site per month? why don t expand into something that my mom would like to use and embrace some of the traditional news sites and help them promote their content? ''things that just weren t naturally organic in our dna   that is the danger  if fab had stayed small or digg had stayed small and focused on their core and stayed true to their dna, they wouldn t be forced to make these unnatural decisions that eventually lead them not servicing their audience  in fairness, though   i ll play devil s advocate asshole here  if you sign up for taking venture capital, you have to understand the economics of venture capital  they need you to grow  they, in turn, have their bosses who are the lps with a fiduciary responsibility to try to generate a 10x or 100x return for a few startups  the rest are going to be dogs, dead, or zombies ''kevin rose  and i think that s where, as kevin the 25 year old founder versus where i am today, the difference is that the 25 year old kevin would ve taken that as gospel   hey, you should go do x, y, and z    okay, i m going to go do that  that sounds great  you guys have been down this road before   the kevin today would say,  thank you very much, trusted advisor,  and take that into consideration  oftentimes it is great advice  eight times out of ten you re going to agree with them ''but there s that couple of times when you re going to say,  that doesn t make sense for my business  i respect you and your idea, but we re not going to do that  it s just not   and they can t force your hand in that unless they have control of the board, in which case that s a whole separate conversation  alright  i have two more questions for you  let s do it ''kevin rose  biggest misconception people have about you  that i have an issue with hard work  i don t have an issue with hard work  i have an issue with hard work applied to stupid things  you should focus on being effective, picking the right things to do before you focus on being efficient, which is doing things well ''kevin rose  do you really only work four hours a week?''tim ferriss  oh god  here s the reality, and you know this  i know you re verbally fucking tickling my balls to make me uncomfortable  the fact is, i don t have to work at all if i don t want to work  that is not the driver for me at this point in my life ''kevin rose  i was just joking  you don t have to answer this question  oh goddammit  i m not allowed to have booze right now  i could use some booze, but i m not gonna do it for reasons i can t discuss  top secret  continue ''kevin rose  okay, next question  this is a very serious question  i think other people out there will be curious about this  the rumors about by 21 inch cock are all true ''kevin rose  there you go  i can t even blame it on the booze  i haven t had any ''kevin rose  you re 39  39   dirty old man  no, i m 38 ''kevin rose  sorry, i m one year behind  early onset alzheimer s ''kevin rose  so you re not married yet  i m not ''kevin rose  i ve known you for quite a while now and i ve seen you through a handful of relationships  for those that don t know you, what do you look for in a woman and what s your take on dating? i m curious  who dates time ferriss? what do you look for?''tim ferriss  masochistic, ill advised women  that s not true  i m joking  i m looking for a half japanese, half italian, bisexual  ''kevin rose  be serious    architect, super athlete, part time swimsuit model?''kevin rose  you re not joking, either  that s the funny part  i know you well enough to know you re joking for the podcast but you re really not joking  who knows how to squat with the least body weight ''kevin rose  this is actually what you re looking for  i ll put it this way  i wouldn t mind that  that sounds like a very enjoyable conversation  i look for generally what i look for in a human being ''kevin rose  do you want someone who can kick your ass, though? you re a hardcore person  yeah, i m hardcore ''kevin rose  i d say of all my friends, you are   even though you can relax and meditate, you re very into shit and take stuff very seriously  yeah, i m hardcore about a lot of things  i can be hard around the edges  these are characteristics that i don t know if i could fix and i m not sure i want to fix them  i ve seen so many benefits from them  they ve been useful tools  i will tell you i ve dated women who are very, very feminine and yen   very swirling in emotional range and very nurturing  i ve also dated women who are extremely tough and make me want to be more resilient, less reactive, hyper driven ''both of those can work for me  it s important that you can have someone who is driven and tough like that who doesn t feel the need to constantly butt heads to assert being an alpha  that is something i can t have in a relationship because i m already that way  you can t have two of those in one room  it s like chinese fighting fish  you put them in a bowl and they just fucking kill each other  that dynamic doesn t work ''whether it s a heterosexual, homosexual, or whatever sexual relationship, there has to be a compliment of personality traits and strengths and weaknesses  i could go down a long list  what do you want me to focus on?''kevin rose  i m just curious what it is you re looking for now  we don t have to go   what s that? yeah, that was a good answer  i ll be honest  there is a big part of me   i, not too long ago, got out of a very long, very serious, fantastic relationship that i reflect on a lot  but ultimately, i wasn t sure what i was looking for in my life as it relates to family and or marriage  that led to a level of indecision that was unfair to my partner at the time  when you ask me what i m looking for, part of me wants to say i don t know  i know what i can t stand  i can tell you that  but what i might look for in a person that i m envisioning as the mother of several kids of mine is very different from what i envision say if i m considering that my life might be a combination of different women or  ''kevin rose  oh shit    a lack of marriage entirely  but having say   maybe i have a wife and then a mistress and they both know each other  maybe i have two wives  maybe i have a raise the red lantern situation with like six wives  sounds like a huge headache on a lot of levels to me personally  maybe it s a series of very intimate lovers that i stay in touch with  i don t know, honestly  it s a big question mark to me  for the time being, i m spending time with people   and this includes women   who i respect a lot ''so whether they are super hardcore and driven or just very good at what they do, but extremely soft and able to counterbalance some of my hard edged, steely attributes   which can be really damaging in excess  i need someone to help temper that  i respect them because they re good at what they re do  i enjoy spending time with them because i learn from them  they don t take themselves too seriously  they can laugh at themselves  they take care of themselves physically ''for most of my friends, that s a criterion as well  i want to be averaged up in all ways possible by the people i surround myself with  even if i have some friends who might not take care of themselves physically, i need at least a few close friends who do  because if i m the average of the five people i associate with most, well shit  i need to be very careful about how i allocate those interactions  i like really nice hamstrings  i like big brown eyes and little brown ankles, as one friend would put it ''kevin rose  little brown ankles?''tim ferriss  that s how he describes the type of woman he likes  i like generally long hair, but i can think of an exception to all of these things  that s the thing  people are like,  what s your type?  super hot, smart, and funny? i don t know  color doesn t matter to me  in terms of short hair versus long hair   nah  tattoos or no tattoos or piercings or no piercings   i ve dated every possible permutation of those  i don t know what to tell you  i love women, period  i m not sure what to do about that  i think that s part of the challenge that i m having ''kevin rose  that was a great answer  i think that s all we got  well, how should we close out? do you have any parting thoughts, recommendations, reflections?''kevin rose  yes, i do  sign up for my newsletter, thejournal email, on the internet  i send out a once a month newsletter of all my crazy chaotic stuff, gear, and tech stuff i m checking out  that also has a podcast on itunes  and also, i think virtual reality sucks  i tried the htc and it s stupid  i think you re going to lose this bet ''kevin rose  you sent out a tweet saying,  virtual reality is blowing my mind  i now see the light   i saw that tweet from you three months ago  yeah, i don t take it back  i stand by it ''kevin rose  it s so dumb  virtual reality s so dumb  alright ''kevin rose  did you try the htc 1 that you put on your head?''tim ferriss  i tried the vive with  ''kevin rose  the vive, yeah  that s the one  i think it was the valve with  ''kevin rose  at adam s lab?''tim ferriss  no, a different lab  it had valve software running on it ''kevin rose  if you were really that blown away   i was very impressed  maybe i have better long term vision than you do  maybe i can see the potential ''kevin rose  no  no, this is one of those things where it s a hype cycle in silicon valley  sadly, the benefit to the consumer has to be in the order of magnitude better than what they re already experiencing for it to ever get adopted  that comes on a couple of fronts   on the application front  they have to enjoy it at least 10x or greater  and then it also comes on the comfort and wearability and maintenance and set up and everything else that goes with owning a virtual reality system ''and sadly, we re all going to realize that it s much like the wii  it was fun for the first five games of wii bowling that i played, but then it ends up in a drawer  just like 3d tv  well, here s what i think you re missing  darya s giving the hands up, i don t know what you re talking about   here s the difference if we re looking at purely the entertainment applications restricted to video games  the wii required entirely new types of games to be created, which basically were reminiscent of early nintendo sports games  they re very different from the games that are currently blockbusters ''but what if you take virtual reality, and simply use that to enhance the most popular first person shooter games and call of duty and so forth   which i don t think is that much of a stretch  i don t think that s a hard sell  i think that is substantially better than what is currently available ''kevin rose  we ll see  i think it s a pretty   i would say there s a couple of different camps in the virtual reality space  there s one that thinks it s going to be accessory for gaming and the other one that says we re going to be watching movies like that and sit around watching the super bowl  everyone will have one at a super bowl party  we re wearing headsets and trying to cram freaking nachos underneath the mask  that s a real thing  people are saying that kind of stuff  i believe the maintenance and set up is just really difficult  i don t see the super bowl soon  i don t see that type of interaction happening  you re sacrificing an element  we could all watch the fricking super bowl at home by ourselves  but we go to a super bowl party  why? there s a communal aspect to it and elements of that experience that are not fully accounted for when someone brings up the example of the super bowl party and using it so you can stand in the middle of the field and have a fucking crazy 300 pound guy charge at you  that sounds like fun ''maybe there are permutations on that that could work, but with something like call of duty, where you re sitting in your basement in your underwear playing it anyway, i think   in that case, let s say it is a hype cycle  what does the landscape of vr look like in three years or five years? has this been abandoned?''kevin rose  obviously, a lot of money is going into game development and app development in vr   tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars from some of the top companies  but it s one of those things where, if consumers don t demand this hardware and it doesn t sell through, then those funds are going to quickly dry up  it s very much a chicken and egg thing  you need original content, and original experiences, more so than just a flying whale coming by your head that s in a 30 second demo ''you need real content that s developed for vr, which is expensive to create  it s a chicken and egg thing, but you need a hell of a lot of eggs  you need a lot of great games  if you get in there and have a mediocre experience or,  i only have two headsets  we can t play co op,  there s 1,000 use cases i could describe where it ends up frustrating the gamer and it sits in the corner and they go back to the way things were ''this has been tried time and time again  this isn t the first type of   i had a nintendo power glove back in the day  i put my hand in the glove and i tried to do different things with it  do you remember that thing with the little keyboard on the side of it?''tim ferriss  i do remember it ''kevin rose  we ve tried these devices to augment our gaming experiences and yet we all still come back to the standard controller  it s easy  i can toss you one  we can sit there and drink a beer while we re doing it  there s a thousand little things you can do that you can t do with these big ass headsets on  and you need a dedicated room if you re going to walk around with them  you d be bumping into furniture and shit  there are so many hurdles to get over here  i just think those hurdles are a little too high ''i will say one thing  augmented reality is very much different than virtual reality, and that i still think the jury s out  i m talking about where you put on a pair of glasses that allow you to project   at least back into your eye   the idea of there being little living creatures and different things crawling around in your furniture  have you seen some of those things?''tim ferriss  i have  they scare the shit out of me ''kevin rose  that is cool enough  it s not just that  it s like overlaying things onto reality as you visually experience it today ''kevin rose  that s right  that i haven t written off yet  but this idea of virtual reality   and i ll be the first to admit i m wrong if two years from now this is not the case  but i just had this gut feeling  sometimes i like to be a little bit different than everybody else  stir the pot ''kevin rose  yeah  you have a bet riding on this, do you not?''kevin rose  on virtual reality failing?''tim ferriss  yeah  don t you have a  ''kevin rose  oh, adam, yeah  i m betting a neuroscience friend of ours   very well known neuroscientist ''kevin rose  he s on your podcast  adam gazzaley ''kevin rose  he has drunk the kool aid  he s poured the kool aid into the water, mixed it, and drank it  he s hardcore  just as context, darya used to work with adam  is it fair to say he s one of the preeminent neuroscientists in the world? md, phd, studies gaming, has developed gaming, has a lab at ucsf   one of the best regarded in the country, certainly ''kevin rose  what does that   50 people? something like that  this isn t like a homeless guy on the corner with a sandwich board saying vr is coming  you have a qualified opponent ''kevin rose  no, i get that  i think that he is a good opponent  he is not a technologist  he s a neuroscientist  he has a dedicated big ass room for virtual reality  so when he goes and plays in virtual reality   and i ve been in his lab and played with his equipment   it is quite fun  but he has a big ass room that he gets to   not everyone has that room  i don t have that room here in new york  it s a different environment when   how specific are your criteria for success of failure? for me  ''kevin rose  it s very loose    if there are fucking rooms all over a given city, and then in every city, where people can go experience virtual reality, that seems like it s at least gaining a foothold  that would be some measure of success ''kevin rose  i think that virtual reality as a form of laser tag could be really interesting  i actually saw that a week ago and it looked pretty fascinating  it had 10 people in a room that were all wearing headsets  they could see each other in the virtual world  monsters could appear and they could run around corners and shoot them and things like that  but that s just scandia fun  that s like mini golf  that s going to be a   scandia?''kevin rose  scandia s a thing on the west coast  it s a mini golf course where you go ride go carts and play mini golf  that s the kind of fun that is  i think that what adam s talking about is this in almost every home and it being a fixture of your household  see, i think you re overweighting the entire room experience, which is definitely an enhancement and improvement over the stationary experience  but i could see people with immersive sound systems in the headsets themselves so you have surround sound, using the headset in conjunction with a controller, and having an incredible virtual reality experience ''kevin rose  we ll see, dude  i ll tell you a story that i probably shouldn t tell  i was at google and i went to google x, which is very limited access  they do all of the crazy and top secret experiments  they had google glass before they announced it  i somehow talked the glass team into giving me one of the first prototypes outside of the team  so i got one of the first 10 units  it had the beta software on it and i had it hooked up to my android phone  i could see all of my text notifications  it was the coolest thing if you were in silicon valley to have back then  no one had one  i wore it to a party one time and it was stupid  i remember  a friend of ours showed up at south by southwest with google glass on and it was just a nerd magnet  throngs of people were surrounding her everywhere she went ''kevin rose  as my wife will tell you, i had mine for two weeks or something like that  i gave it back to the glass team  they were like,  what the fuck? everybody wants one of these  why are you turning this in?  they expected me to have it for the next three months  i m just like,  no one is going to use this  it s too dorky  it s another thing i have to charge  we don t need more of those in our lives  it s heavy  it s bulky  ''i didn t understand it and that was my gut, consumer, product person s take on it  i ended up just abandoning it  i feel the same way about virtual reality  only time will tell  i don t think it will take that much time, either  i think there is so many big announcements and launches coming up soon  within the next year or 18 months, we should have a pretty good idea of what s going to fly or not fly  what s at stake?''kevin rose  it requires a trip to japan to buy a bottle of hibiki 30 year aged whiskey, which you can t find in the united states  they don t import it into the united states  that s a good bet ''kevin rose  it s a good bet  it s a win win because i m going to help him drink some of it if i have to give it to him  it should be fun  i think that, even if i lose the bet, i ll be pretty impressed and happy  if they come out with a few titles where i m just blown away, i ll be the first to say this is going to take off  but my gut doesn t tell me so  the jury s out ''kevin rose  we ll see  well, another random show on the books  you already mentioned the journal  i will tell people  check out the t shirts  i ve never done t shirts before  100 percent of the proceeds are going to psychedelic research, most likely psilocybin, at top universities ''i m not making anything from it whatsoever  everything is going to senior scientists who are working on very fascinating applications of compounds that have been neglected  they can potentially address some extremely debilitating conditions that have very few options otherwise medically speaking  check out the shirts  if you like them  ''kevin rose  american apparel shirts?''tim ferriss  i ll have to look  i went through  ''kevin rose  is it cotton or a blend?''tim ferriss  most likely a blend  i went through all of my own t shirts and picked out the most comfortable and the designs that i liked and sat down with a sourcing team and looked at how to make the most comfortable shirts possible  i m test driving the prototypes ''kevin rose  they re not made from mushrooms?''tim ferriss  they re not made from mushrooms  they don t disintegrate  you don t take a shower with them and sprout anything  you can t grind them up and eat them  that would be pretty amazing, but no  fourhourworkweek com mushroom  check them out  find us on twitter if you have anything to correct, say, or add  and i feel like that s about it ''kevin rose  that s it  thanks for listening  alright, thanks for listening, guys  you can find show notes, links to various things that we have mentioned, at fourhourworkweek com podcast, as well as show notes for every other episode  until next time  see you  thanks for sticking around '"
201,209,"The Random Show Threesome — Tim Ferriss, Kevin Rose, and Matt Mullenweg (#209)","'this was my first live podcast in new york city and it was split into a few parts  this part is a live edition of the random show  there are two guests  we have kevin rose, my partner in crime for many things  kevin rose   twitter, instagram   you can also find him at thejournal email  he has a great newsletter  he s one of the best stock pickers in the start up world ''he predicts even non tech trends with incredible accuracy  co founder of digg, revision3, which was sold to discovery, and milk, which was sold to google  after that, he became a general partner at google ventures, where he was part of the investment team that funded companies such as uber, medium, and blue bottle coffee  he s now the ceo of hodinkee, the world s leading online wristwatch marketplace and news site  he has a lot more, of course in his bio  the other   this is my first random show threesome   is matt mullenweg, one of the most popular guests that i ve had on the tim ferriss show  an incredible guy ''twitter, instagram   website  ma tt  he s been named one of businessweek s 25 most influential people on the web  i think that s an understatement  he s perhaps best known as the original lead developer of wordpress, which now powers more than 25 percent of the entire web  if you ve visited sites like the wall street journal, forbes, ted, nfl, or reuters, or my website, then you ve seen wordpress in action ''he s also the ceo of automattic  maybe you didn t notice it s m a t t in the middle   automattic, which is valued at more than a billion dollars and has a fully distributed team of 500 employees around the world  i m also an advisor to that company  we had a blast  we talk a lot about setting goals, new year s resolutions and so on because quite frankly, i wanted to ask them  i m always looking for help myself  so i do hope you enjoy this tim ferriss show episode and also random show episode with kevin rose and matt mullenweg ''all right  so we re going to bring our next guests out and we re going to get to it  so please welcome to the stage matt mullenweg and kevin rose  i ll hand you guys these mics ''kevin rose  howdy ''matt mullenweg  thank you, sir  hello  hey, everybody  this is a live edition threesome of the random show  welcome to that  what do we have here, kevin? what are you drinking?''kevin rose  i have no idea  these guys at the corner store   it s a  7 00 pinot  fantastic  and we also have, i may have to hail the crazy bulgarian  i think i will do that, actually  crazy bulgarian, that s   you all should get one  they re on sale on amazon  thank you   speaking foreign language   thank you  so we also have  7 00 pinot and then we have matt s reacquaintance, casa dragones  this is a sipping tequila  and we have the finest dixie cups that money can buy ''matt mullenweg  last time we had this we had the blanco and this is the joven  that is correct  mixing it up ''matt mullenweg  we re upgrading  what is the pinot, the  7 00 pinot? they want to know '' off mic  oh, the tequila is casa dragones  it s a sipping tequila, which means you do not make shots out of this  it would be very expensive to do that ''kevin rose  there we go ''matt mullenweg  nice  how s the audio on that? we added that in  so i think i m going to wait for a second  kevin, do you want to do the introduction or should i?''kevin rose  you go ahead  i m pouring  all right, kevin s pouring ''kevin rose  do you want wine or do you want tequila?''tim ferriss  i ll start with wine and then it ll end poorly as i add tequila ''kevin rose  thank you, sir  this is not hangover  7 00, by the way  it s a little bit better than that  all right, fantastic ''kevin rose  just so you know, you re not going to be   i appreciate that ''kevin rose  yeah  so first of all  '' crosstalk  matt left without   what a dick ''matt mullenweg  i m drinking straight tequila  i m already screwing things up, sorry man ''kevin rose  no worries, no worries  cheers  cheers, guys ''matt mullenweg  cheers  and cheers, audience  thank you for coming  this is a great way, a really fun way for me to wind up the week with everybody  welcome to the random show episode  679 ''kevin rose  we have no idea what number it is  we always just make up the number  we have no idea where we are  i am tim ferriss ''kevin rose  i m kevin rose  and?''matt mullenweg  i m matt mullenweg, special guest  special cameo appearance ''matt mullenweg  woohoo! it s awesome  so kevin, i m going to ask the same question because honestly, i ask questions that i m trying to answer for myself  this is the big secret of the podcast and the random show  how do you think about the end of the year? like how are you thinking about what to change? what to keep the same? do you have any approach to that?''kevin rose  that s a good question  so typically i do my end of year, new year s resolution list  this time, i decided to forego that and not do one at all, actually  because every year, i tend to stick to about half of the things that i want to do  however, i have made a lot of tweaks recently that i want to carry on into the new year  one of them for me was just really dialing in all of my different blood levels  we have a mutual friend, peter thiel, who s been on your show a bunch ''he s helping me dial everything in now that i m getting a little bit older  so i ve been doing a lot of crazy hacks around that  like what?''kevin rose  well, i just completed my first five day fast, which was really shitty, to be honest  was that water only?''kevin rose  no, it was very   a lot of broths that go with it  so obviously super low calorie  still shoots up your ketones, but i thought it was going to be pretty easy because everyone talks about fasting  it s great, blah, blah, blah  you lose five pounds  obviously it improves a bunch of different markers  my gf 1 levels, hopefully my insulin resistance and things like that  but i decided to give it a shot and on day 3, i was just beat down, zapped, like in hell  day 4 was worse  day 5, i caught a cold  i mean, it was really bad  but after about a week later, i just felt amazing ''i just had my blood draw done and so we ll see if it improved a lot of those different markers that i m looking at  so fasting is definitely something i m interested in, something i ll be doing  you did this using the fast mimicking diet, correct?''kevin rose  that s right  this is from dr  longo ''kevin rose  yeah, valter longo  it s prepackaged, low calorie food ''kevin rose  yeah, so it s pretty   it s intended to allow you to mimic the benefits of pure fasting while consuming nutrient dense food of some type ''kevin rose  that s right  he s a scientist that basically said okay, we all know that fasting with just water only really sucks  is it possible to   that was actually, i think, the headline of his paper ''kevin rose  that was his paper, actually  no, but he said okay, there are a lot of people that can benefit from this  cancer patients and people with diabetes and a few other folks that we know benefit from fasting  were you not recording?''tim ferriss  no, i was recording  i turned off the mic that isn t being used ''kevin rose  okay  yeah, if you could just repeat all that ''kevin rose  yeah, exactly  so anyway, long story short, he was like, okay, i m going to do a study, and do some research and see what the minimal amount of food that you can eat but still get these positive benefits on the fasting side  he found out that it s right around 500 calories a day, which sounds like a lot, but actually it s just a couple sipping broths and two olives and one almond is basically what i ate every day  do you think your fast would ve been easier had you not gone through the torture of being like okay, i m going to eat, but i m only allowed to have one and three quarter olives?''kevin rose  i think it would ve been easier  so the problem   and i m curious if this is   so longo s diet actually suggests things like a pretty high, starchy diet  so you don t get into full ketosis  you re in kind of this like really shitty zone  yeah, you re in the limbo, misery zone ''kevin rose  yeah, you re like  8 millimolars of ketones  it s kind of this really crappy, no energy, and not enough carbs to have energy, not few enough carbs to be in full ketosis '' so, it s a bad place to be  i would like to   and something i was working with rhonda patrick on recently, another scientist that s been on your show   her thoughts are okay, let s take the same amount of calories  let s flip it and say all high fat though, so you can fully get into ketosis  that s kind of the thinking on round 2 that i might try and see what it does  yeah, i endorse the second, for sure  which is basically when i do when i m fasting for any period of time  by the way, you should do this with medical supervision  clearly, he is  but allowing some degree of fat, or at least exogenous ketones or mcts to make the first two days a little bit easier in transition ''matt mullenweg  yeah, don t you also like sleep in a hyperbaric chamber or something?''tim ferriss  like michael jackson?''kevin rose  yeah, i was just going to say that  i don t sleep in a hyperbaric chamber  i ve done hyperbaric oxygen treatments before during fasts  primarily just to see  ''matt mullenweg  did you just google that?''tim ferriss  just to see what would happen  well, it turns out that dominic d agostino   who is this incredible scientist who s been on the podcast who has, i think, the second longest chapter in tools of titans, which goes deeply into ketosis and fasting and ketogenic diets and so on   has also done studies looking at how to use or applications of hyperbaric oxygen treatment or therapy to different types of disease states  i was just very curious to see what would happen, so i ll give you an example  this is going to sound like i m completely making this up, but i tracked it and you can choose to believe it or not ''i went into a hyperbaric chamber at about, i want to say 2 5 atmospheres usually, and that s an indicator of the pressure  you have to be very careful with this  they do not allow you to take inside because it s pumped full of pure oxygen and if you have say a paperclip, you could ignite yourself into a gigantic fireball ''or anything just about  you can t bring anything in there  you have to wear very   you have to wear their clothing and so on  there were two things that i did simultaneously in the hyperbaric chamber  i was in there for a total of about 90 minutes  again, don t try this at home  do this with proper supervision, which i had  i was deep into ketosis because i did a 10 day fast, which you would never try without medical supervision  i was at about 6 millimolars or 6 5 millimolars, which is the concentration of ketones in your blood  i use a device called a precision xtra, x t r a, to measure this  it s very simple to do  so i was in deep, full blown ketosis  what dom noticed, dominic, and i noticed and other people noticed, when you re in deep ketosis, and there are scientific reasons this is the case, you can hold your breath about twice as long as normal, if not more ''kevin rose  didn t navy seals try and do this or there s something he was doing training for the government  so dom has been funded by divisions of and components of the military to develop supplemental ketones and other therapies that people can use to avoid hypoxic disorders ''so if, for instance, you re a navy seal and you need to be underwater for a long period of time with a rebreather, a certain type of breathing apparatus, you can develop   i suppose in the extreme   brain damage from being underwater for a very long period of time  so if you can extract more energy from every molecule of oxygen, there s a huge competitive   well, competitive   it s called a competitive advantage  so he s been developing these ketone esters and so on for military applications  so i was not only in deep ketosis, i was in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber, so i m breathing effectively 100 percent oxygen  i did a bunch of wim hof breathing exercises while inside the capsule ''kevin rose  nice  and i  ''kevin rose  did you pass out? you must ve passed out  i thought my brain was going to melt at one point and i stopped and then i held my breath ''i did three rounds of breath holding and i held my breath for seven and a half minutes ''kevin rose  and then you did high dose mushrooms right after that?''tim ferriss  it might ve been two hours before, which would explain the feeling of weightlessness  no, but seven and a half minutes  if i tried to hold my breath right now, it d be about 45 seconds  that s my normal  ''matt mullenweg  how did you count? because you can t have any devices or anything?''tim ferriss  oh, no  there are windows because they ll show you like cheesy  80s movies which they have on dvd while you re sitting there bored out of your skull  so if you want to watch lethal weapon 17, it s available  they have  ''matt mullenweg  sign me up '' crosstalk  and they have clocks outside that you can see, so i could actually track the time  what about you, matt? we re going like rewinding here a bit  in terms of end of year stuff, how do you think about that? do you do a recap?''matt mullenweg  yeah, actually i just got out, i was telling kevin we just did the sort of all of the execs at automattic   which is the company where i work at where we make wordpress com and stuff   got together to plan out actually the next three years ''then on saturday, i delivered the state of the word address, which is like the annual wordpress, this is   it s like state of the union, but for bloggers, i guess  so a lot of planning  basically, my last month has been super heads down  i ve been in a cave  just like today coming out of it, which is kind of cool to share that with all of you  and  all of y all,  that s a massachusetts accent, if you were wondering  but correct me if i m wrong, but that s primarily a work focus, right? you re looking at the future of the organization  you re looking at the future of say wordpress as an open source project, potentially  do you do the same personally? do you have three year goals outside of that personally? of course the business involves you, but are there things outside of that you have long term goals for?''matt mullenweg  i typically make a simplenote for each year, like goals within the year  i started the 2017 one  the only thing in it so far is to visit russia  wait a second, all right  do you have sticky note on your computer and you just write in 2017   enter  is it russia or do you put this in? how do you capture this?''matt mullenweg  so simplenote, the app  simplenote, yeah ''matt mullenweg  i kind of dissed russia accidentally, because i was looking at a map of all the workcamps in the world  i was like,  hey, russia, what s up?  but just being like a geographically ignorant american, i didn t realize that 90 percent of russia lives in the western 10 percent  so there was actually a workcamp in moscow that i pretended there wasn t  so all the russians got mad at me  i figured that was a very bad thing  so i was like okay, i ll go to russia  make amends ''matt mullenweg  so that s why i wrote it down  so it s a diplomatic mission?''matt mullenweg  yes  what did you have in your list for 2016?''matt mullenweg  so much  it s actually a long list  this year took a few side turns ''i try to think   actually it s something i often do around the end of the year is i ask a lot of people who i know, kind of crowdsource resolutions  have you ever tried this?''tim ferriss  no ''matt mullenweg  you should do it  all right, what should we do?''tim ferriss  let s try it  okay, so visit russia ''matt mullenweg  we ve done this before, actually  yeah, we have done this before  we ve been on a lot of thelma and louise style travel trips before ''kevin rose  i have one for matt that i want you to do this year  you have an assignment for matt?''kevin rose  he wanted crowdsourcing, we re giving crowdsourcing  okay, all right ''matt mullenweg  this is exactly the idea ''kevin rose  i want you to do the wim hof method, the ice training, the freezing cold  that has been a game changer for me last year ''matt mullenweg  so i get met the dude at  inaudible   i went to his workshop  but i haven t really done it since  it was a little weird  just something for your list if you want to add it ''matt mullenweg  do you ever wim hof in public?''tim ferriss  do i ever wim hof in public?''matt mullenweg  because it s very vigorous breathing, right?''tim ferriss  oh ''matt mullenweg  so sometimes i feel like i could use a little energy right now, but then i don t want people to  '' crosstalk  you don t want people to call the police when you re doing it in a waiting room?''matt mullenweg  yeah  so just a caveat on wim hof for everybody  fascinating stuff  you have to be very careful  so josh waitzkin, we ve talked to before  '' crosstalk  the shallow water blackout that he suffered from, which could have killed him, was after practicing wim hof breathing before swimming  you have to be very, very, very careful with this ''matt mullenweg  can i just say anything tim recommends you should be very careful?''tim ferriss  morning journaling   you can take your thumbs off  that s high velocity journaling, only professionals ''matt mullenweg  so i m down with this though  have you done the hiking the mountain in your underwear thing? how cold do you get?''kevin rose  more or less  less the mountain and less the underwear ''kevin rose  i mean, there s a photo on the internet of me in my underwear in the ice ''matt mullenweg  really? wow ''kevin rose  so i did go that far  i will say to everyone out there, the wim method, you ve probably heard him on tim s show and he s been on a bunch of podcasts  it s ten weeks of pretty hardcore training ''matt mullenweg  ten weeks?''kevin rose  that starts off really slow  so you start off with like a 15 second cold shower at the end of your shower and then it gradually builds up to   for me, at the end, it was buying ten bags of ice, putting it in my bathtub and then laying there up to my neck for about 15, 20 minutes and not even shivering  so you actually gain a pretty high tolerance to the stuff  but the thing that was most interesting to me is that i think that at least for me, all of us, me and most people i ve talked to, we have this emotional rollercoaster we all ride  for me, it s always between the 80 and 90 percent ''some days are great and you can go up to 100, but it s always depending on what s going on in your life and what challenges you have  you re always kind of riding that  i ve always considered myself a pretty happy person, but after about two or three weeks, actually week 2, the end of week 2, the breathing exercises are great, but it s really the cold that does it ''it releases a bunch of different compounds in your brain and you feel just amazing  more energy and focus and just i felt as though almost like when you re a kid and you don t have a worry in the world and everything feels amazing and you lose track of time? i got all of those emotions back again  for me, it s kind of a winter thing because the cold is coming anyway  so every year   and even now, i m on week 2 of it, i started back up again  i just feel so much better  it s crazy  it lifts the bar  i didn t know the bar could go that high ''so you still have those little fluctuations, but the bar is a little bit higher for me  and rhonda will give you all the science behind it  it s the release of norepinephrine in the brain, but it s amazing stuff ''matt mullenweg  so we both got here at the same time  we were both wearing coats ''kevin rose  that s right  kevin actually walked through the lobby  he was in underwear and he had ice packs strapped to his body ''kevin rose  yeah, you don t know what i have underneath this  do you want me to strip down? i mean, i can go low if you want '' crosstalk  do you guys want kevin to strip down?''kevin rose  this is every time i hang out with him ''matt mullenweg  like two people   the people want it  those two people want it ''matt mullenweg  is this boring?''tim ferriss  so the cold, i m just going to make a note on that, which is coming back to one of the audience questions about chillness  this is something that i ve also invested in, in the sense that i m regularly going to russian baths  you guys are very fortunate if you re in new york city to have some incredible russian and turkish baths here, as filthy as they may be, that have tremendous cold plunges ''kevin rose  i took my wife one time  she s like,  i am never going back to that place, ever   yeah, when i went there i think three trips ago  there was a guy, this old russian guy, shaving his neck ''kevin rose  shaving   i was with you  and blowing hair just into, just onto the floor where everyone was walking ''matt mullenweg  ohmygod, that is  ''kevin rose  we were sitting there, looking at this guy and he s blowing his hair   it was disgusting  onto the floor, so yeah, wear your sandals ''kevin rose  something about that is awesome though '' crosstalk  even as far back as van gogh, when he cut his ear off, which i also don t recommend, was prescribed cold baths as part of the recovery therapy ''kevin rose  who was that?''tim ferriss  van gogh, the painter?''kevin rose  oh, yeah ''matt mullenweg  he s the best example  '' crosstalk  no, look, no one bats 1,000, but  ''matt mullenweg  i do have a question about the cold thing, because i know you both do it  have either of you done that thing where you get in the freezing thing?''tim ferriss  oh, yeah, a ton of times  the cryotherapy?''matt mullenweg  yeah, the cryotherapy  how does it compare?''kevin rose  i don t think it s as good, actually, as the ice  i don t use it ''kevin rose  ice is better ''matt mullenweg  whoa, okay  i prefer the ice  the cryotherapy, there are a few things  no  1, it really just  ''matt mullenweg  i just want another device in my house  well, so it turns out i was going to get a cryotherapy chamber in my house  very dangerous for a host of reasons ''matt mullenweg  well, you want an attendant, right?''tim ferriss  you want an attendant and also the gas that is used can be highly explosive  i looked into this quite seriously and decided against it for a million reasons  but the ice   super cheap  i have a standing freezer that is dedicated to ice  i have bags of ice  i looked at all these sophisticated cooling systems and i just decided, use instacart, if you have the option, to get a bunch of ice  i m like their nightmare customer '' crosstalk  i m like the 1 percent who s like ohmygod  i can get 100 pounds of ice delivered for  5 00? yeah, i m in  sure  then i put it in this standing freezer dedicated further  ''kevin rose  this is why startups fail, people, is people like you  the tim ferriss effect  the dark side ''kevin rose  it s like pets com ordering the dog food for free shipping  exactly, the edge cases  those are going to bleed you  but the cryotherapy, i also didn t like the fact that on numerous occasions i ve tried it and my eyelids have frozen shut  just not really a huge fan of that experience or sensation whatsoever ''matt mullenweg  what d you say? eyelids?''tim ferriss  yeah, my eyes froze shut  so i wasn t a huge fan of that entire sensory experience  it s not something that i would expect to pay for ''matt mullenweg  you ve just got to open your mind, tim  yeah  trust me  i think it s too open  i have the surgeries and mris to prove it  what other types of resolutions are you hoping to crowdsource?''matt mullenweg  well, i like this  kevin gave me one  can i get one from you and then we can trade them?'' crosstalk  sure  and, in fact, the way i learned to swim was by doing this exercise with a friend named chris ashington  we gave each other assignments  so his was a one kilometer minimum open water swim  at the time, i couldn t do one lap  so that was the incentive  the potential for never ending shaming that drove me to learn to swim in my 30s  for him, he was addicted to stimulants  meaning just tons of double espressos, coffees, everything you can imagine, all day every day ''so, it was a year without anything stronger than green tea, which he also did  so it changed both of our lives that year  i ll give you a resolution  i would say because of how much we have traveled together, i will say conversational fluency in a foreign language ''matt mullenweg  that s been on the resolutions for like ten years  i just stopped trying  i know  when we travel, the deal is i m like the tarzan sounding translator  i ll try to learn turkish or whatever language corresponds to where we happen to be traveling and matt is like the national geographic photo documentarian  he takes all the photos  so that s been the arrangement  so i would say learn a language ''matt mullenweg  didn t you say something about accentuating strengths instead of improving weaknesses?''tim ferriss  i did, but i think you re trying to dodge this assignment that you have asked for  so i would say conversational fluency, which just means being able to hold a basic, five minute conversation in a foreign language ''matt mullenweg  all right  can i do one for you?''kevin rose  yes, i would love that ''matt mullenweg  i think a little bit   have you ever done a long hike, like a week or more recently?''kevin rose  no ''matt mullenweg  you re kind of a city, comfort guy?''kevin rose  no, i like it outdoors ''matt mullenweg  you like outdoors?''kevin rose  i mean, i do little hikes like little jaunts and whatnot ''matt mullenweg  so that s  '' crosstalk  he s talking about the two blocks to get some blue bottle coffee ''kevin rose  yeah, i take my dog for a walk  i throw the ball ''matt mullenweg  that would be the thing, like a long hike ''kevin rose  yeah, explain the one that you were telling me backstage, because that one sounds amazing  oh, is this the japan walk?''matt mullenweg  yeah, so with dan rubin and craig mohr i did a kumano kodo, which is a pilgrimage  inaudible   kind of like the camino santiago, i think it s called?''tim ferriss  yeah, camino santiago ''matt mullenweg  so it was about 100 kilometers we did over eight days from the coast to koyasan  it was super amazing  it was like glamping, which is totally okay for this challenge, for this resolution, even though you re not  '' crosstalk  don t tell kevin that  he ll have sherpas carrying him on a throne ''kevin rose  dude, you are more like that than i am  what are you talking about?''kevin rose  i am an eagle scout, so i have that  kevin, i m so tired of this eagle scout routine  we can be talking about fucking anything '' crosstalk ''kevin rose  it s because  inaudible  come back to that, that s why  you re like yeah, we should really go do this and this and this and then go pick our friends at the crosby and you re like, hey, i was an eagle scout ''kevin rose  it s like that joke,  how do you know someone s an eagle scout? they tell you in the first 30 seconds   it s like crossfit and veganism and eagle scouts ''kevin rose  dude, why do you have to  inaudible  eagle scouts?''tim ferriss  no, i like them  i m just like, thou doth protest too much ''matt mullenweg  it s actually legit ''kevin rose  thank you ''matt mullenweg  i only made it to star  eagle scout is   high five ''kevin rose  dude, star is pretty legit too ''matt mullenweg  i mean, it s okay  that was okay  so japan ''matt mullenweg  okay, so maybe the outdoor thing  if you did eagle scout   did you ever do philmont? i bailed on the philmont trip  wait, what s philmont?''matt mullenweg  philmont s like this famous, boy scout hiking thing ''kevin rose  it s like 50 miles though  if you re going to do a week of hiking, you re probably going to cover more than 50 miles ''kevin rose  well, his was pretty short though  what was it?''matt mullenweg  100 kilometers, it s not so bad  but it s in the mountains, so you re up and down a lot  that s a good one  that s like an extended trip  so people have asked me about my year plan, my two year, and five year plan  the only thing that i will   or i shouldn t say the only   but one type of thing i will schedule far in advance is this type of extended trip  so i think it s an 18 day kayaking trip through the grand canyon planned in 2017  it s the only extended block of time that i ve set aside, aside from japan excitement that is coming shortly  but the benefit of that also is when you put it on the calendar, and i think both of you guys have experienced this, is you get the benefit of anticipation and that is 90 percent of the payoff, if that makes any sense ''matt mullenweg  unless it s a really good trip  then it s like  inaudible   all right  well, for me maybe i have a very overactive imagination  it s like 90 percent of the benefit is the anticipation of it ''kevin rose  i have one for you  oh, boy, here we go  all right  yes, kevin?''kevin rose  no, this is easy and i know you want to do it and you bailed on it this year  ooh, let s hear this ''kevin rose  i want you to do   are you talking about van damme splits? that s on my new year s resolution every year ''kevin rose  i want you to do van damme splits in front of everyone right now  no, i want you to go on a ten day, silent meditation retreat  okay, yeah  no, this is good  so i accept and i actually had it on my calendar to do this year and then i don t know it conflicted with  it conflicted with something ''kevin rose  something happened and you bailed  i remember  yeah, i know, i did, but it was on the calendar ''matt mullenweg  ten days is a lot  ten days is long  no, challenge accepted  i ll do a ten day silent retreat  challenged accepted ''kevin rose  eagle scouts do that a lot, but   those eagle scouts ''matt mullenweg  there s a lot of talk about being eagle scouts  it s like the hunted, right? they re chasing fugitives  that s what i hear about those eagle scouts ''matt mullenweg  for the hikes, i ll say the kumano kodo  apparently, there s an awesome one in iceland, where you can stay in little huts and then the camino santiago one  for those people interested,  ''kevin rose  done    a walk in the woods is a great way to invigorate and  ''kevin rose  well, forest bathing  you ve heard about this, right?''tim ferriss  i was talking about a book  forest bathing?''kevin rose  you said walk in the woods, right?''tim ferriss  a walk in the woods, a book by bill bryson ''kevin rose  okay, so anyway, there was a study that came out recently   well check it out  okay ''kevin rose  i had two glasses of wine before i came out here  so forest bathing, a new japanese study came out that showed that the japanese that spend time in the forest have lower levels of cortisol and all these positive benefits from just spending   it s 15 minutes a week in the forest  i completely believe it  there s so extra wine for you ''matt mullenweg  care for a little more?''kevin rose  i m good  it s amazing how these new discoveries are the most commonsense conclusions that people would have drawn 500 years ago  it s like, let s put you into a concrete prison where everyone s angry and honks a lot and screams at you because you knocked over the cashews  ''kevin rose  don t talk about manhattan like that  well, i was just thinking to myself today, i bet if every person stopped honking, it would all move the same speed  so much anger  so go upstate, take a trip upstate  i think that s a good call  what questions would you guys like to hear answered up here? anything? just fire away  go for it ''female speaker  okay,  inaudible  ''matt mullenweg  ohmygod  i think this is the highest stakes for kevin ''kevin rose  you ve got to repeat the question '' crosstalk  all right  the question is, what is most frustrating and inspiring about the women in our lives?''kevin rose  oh, jesus  this is just like here s a grenade, i m going to pull the pin, and enjoy ''matt mullenweg  that s a great question, really great question  let s start with the inspiration  i ve been very fortunate  i ve had some really great relationships ''kevin rose  oh, here we go  did i tell you i was an eagle scout? let me tell you ''kevin rose  seriously, seriously  okay  i am  i ve been very fortunate to have some really good relationships with significant others over the last six, seven years  fucking kevin  this guy  you can t take him anywhere  i would say whether it s with my mom, with whom i have a very deep relationship or significant others, i think that the   and this is going to sound funny   but i think a lot of men get, they re proud of how analytical they think they are and get very good at ignoring the flashing signal that s right in front of them the whole time  at least speaking personally, that s been the case for me  so helping me to listen to   like ramit said earlier, the intuition, as maligned as that might be and to pay attention to feeling ''this just like kinesthetic embodiment or perception of what is good or bad has been hugely valuable to me  also, i think that men, in general, can be overly aggressive and combative  the fight, i think, is sometimes overestimated as an asset  the counterbalancing that i ve experienced with a number of women in my life, where like, maybe he s just hungry? maybe he s not out to get you  or, he sent that email that you re so upset about ''maybe he just needed a sandwich  chill the fuck out  why are you assuming the absolute worst motivation behind it? having that type of tempering voice has been hugely valuable to me  frustrating? okay  i think this is a tim problem more than anything else, to be honest ''but i am not always the best at expressing my emotions or with contending with some of the emotions that i don t view as particularly valuable to me at a given point in time  so i ve developed a lot of body armor over a lifetime of believing this and getting the shit kicked out of me for a long time in school, literally, physically  i have developed a lot of coping mechanisms and when i am confronted with someone who has, let s just call it more emotional range than i do, more emotional volatility maybe than i do, i am a deer in the headlights  i have a lot of trouble contending with that ''for some women, it s just like a tempest that blows in and blows out and then everything s cool  it s like complete meltdown like crying hysterics for two minutes and they re like i m fine, i m fine, and they re totally cool  i m liked fucked up for hours by that ''so, i would say that s probably pretty high on the list for me  which, i think, again, is more of a  tim  issue than an  anyone else  issue  you guys? go ahead, please  this is when the awkward matt laugh comes out ''matt mullenweg  on the inspiration   first i think, of course, of my mother and just my entire   my mother and my sister, really  mullenweg women are very strong, so they grow up around really strong women  to now, i have the good fortune to work with and be very close friends with women  in the technology field, i think it is a tough one for women, especially engineers  so there are examples of folks who work twice as hard to get half as far ''the resilience i think is something we can all learn from  i think the thing i ve learned the most actually, which is close to yours, which is empathy  this, for me, has been a year where a lot of emotions opened up i didn t even know i had  like what? fury? i ve never seen you really angry ''matt mullenweg  yeah, well, it was grief this year  grief, yeah ''matt mullenweg  my father passed away  yeah, we ve talked a lot about this ''matt mullenweg  and sadness  that was this weird thing where, because it triggered in other places  i d see a story on the news and just get so emotional about it  i was like, wow, where did that come from? that it was something that would have never affected me before  i just would ve been like water off duck  i was practically in tears or in tears for a situation with people i had never knew or heard of ''i was like, where did these emotions come from? how are they happening? how do i make it stop? i ve definitely been close to folks who are like that  i think the frustration for   and this is again, probably a matt thing, probably a tim thing too   is just learning around expectations  something i m learning to navigate more  that men and women sometimes have very different expectations out of the same things  so learning to navigate that is something i m really trying to figure out  what type of things? expectations of what types of things? i m not going to let that slide ''matt mullenweg  so for me, i think part of it s around relationships is kind of where i had expectations in mind where i said that  if you re in a relationship or not in a relationship, what are the expectations going on?''tim ferriss  those are the parameters, the rules of engagement in a relationship ''matt mullenweg  yeah, especially this year, where i m trying to withdraw a little bit and kind of rebuild  also, work s been incredibly busy  so i haven t had a lot of time  rebuild, you mean just yourself?''matt mullenweg  yeah  that whole expectations externally can both be flattering and frustrating and heartbreaking and everything, all in one  what was the   if you re willing to share, there was a book that you found really helpful when contending with grief  i remember you d mentioned it to me  you thought it applied to a lot more than that  i remember when we chatted about it ''matt mullenweg  yeah, i d recommend it  it was elizabeth kubler ross and one of her first books was the one that came up with the five stages of grief  anger, depression, denial, all that  then her last book, which was actually published posthumously, was called on grief and grieving  i think one was called on death and dying, on life and living, and this final book, on grief and grieving  it s really beautiful as well because she wrote it on her deathbed  it helped me understand that grief is something that happens before you have a loss ''the anticipation of a loss  something during  something after  there s a lot of guilt involved at the various stages of that  the other thing i didn t realize that s just useful for everyone to note is the stages don t happen in order  i actually have some glasses that have the stages on them, so you can fill up your booze to the different levels then drink it down  i took a photograph of that today ''matt mullenweg  oh, cool  i thought it was the strangest thing i d ever seen  yeah, there s these little line markers on the glass that correspond to the stages ''matt mullenweg  so part of that implies it s a linear, but you can have a couple going at once and out of order  sometimes you jump into one of those stages just out of the blue  it was definitely one that was really helpful this year  i would recommend for anyone   actually anyone   because we all have parents  sometimes those parents pass  they get older  or just anything in our lives  like you said the other day, people often go before you re ready or they re ready ''it felt like reading it afterwards wasn t ideal, but it felt like i had a lot more, almost emotional vocabulary to talk about these things that i didn t even know what the words were or what the experiences were  okay, kevin  eagle scout ''kevin rose  so, let s see here  my two  i would say that this last thanksgiving was probably pretty difficult when it comes to family and the women in my life  my dad passed away a few years ago, so it s pretty much all women from this point forward  my sister and mom definitely have different political and religious beliefs than i do  so that is very challenging, especially when it s time to sit down and have the religion talk and how i should rejoin the fold in certain ways  i would say that s been the biggest challenge for me, just because it s, you know, it s thanksgiving  it s hard to navigate those waters ''i think with any family, male or female, it really doesn t matter  it can be difficult  so that was biggest challenge  i would say the thing i m most grateful for and impressed by would have to be my wife s willingness to work on problems together  so it s easy for me to get to angry, i m pissed off and stomp and put up a wall  i m very lucky in that it s her natural state to try and work on things and say, well, this is part of being married ''let s continue to work on this and come to a resolution and really break that side of me down into something where i can realize that we are in this for the long term  let s work on this  it will forever be something that we have to work on because there is no such thing as a perfect state, you know?''i mean, there can be for certain periods of time  but there s always going to be something coming up every year  just the ability to have a mate like that, someone that s willing to work on things  it would be hell if you were both like that, right? because that s when relationships fall apart  so i m very fortunate to have someone that s that open to that kind of stuff ''matt mullenweg  thanks for sharing that, by the way  that s really vulnerable ''kevin rose  no problem  so, we re going to close with a question from me and then i think we re going to let you guys get to your friday evening  we ll move on to   for those of you who do have the blue wristbands, we ll do that part ''matt mullenweg  vip  yeah, that s right  vip  god, i hate that acronym  but it s the only one i have as a placeholder ''kevin rose  what s your vip room like? is there like weights in there and  '' crosstalk  ponies everywhere, yeah ''kevin rose  i m just going to pour some of this, by the way  it s very exciting  i hope   that s what you guys read the fine print on that sign up  i think the  inaudible  people are just like cursing themselves for letting me get on stage now  ohmygod, we re moving to tequila ''no, the vip thing is just going to be a smaller group where we can hang  the question i have for you guys, oh, god, wow  look at the heavy hand of matt mullenweg  it s amazing how quiet the room got on the hookers and blow comment  did you see that? so the question is   i m waiting for some residual laughter  okay, everybody got it who was going to get it? great  the question is, what would you like   we re at the tail end of a year   any closing recommendations, asks of the audience or suggestions that you would have?''just for a very good, in this case, 2017, people will be listening to the podcast probably for a very long time  i ll start  so the one that i would recommend is two things  (a) be your stupid, weird self and don t be ashamed of it, which is why i deliberately why i say stupid things like the preceding four or five sentences  and (b) goal setting isn t enough ''goal setting is what we all do  we all set resolutions and we tend to find the same resolutions popping up the next year and then the next and the next  so i think fear setting as an exercise is very important  i ll describe it briefly  it s certainly in tools of titans  i ve written about it elsewhere  you can google  fear setting  and find it  take whatever it is that you re considering or putting off  it could be starting a company, quitting a job, starting a relationship, ending a relationship, and break the page into three columns  so you have what you re considering or putting off at the top   you ve thought about a long time ''on the left hand side, you re going to write down all of the worst things that could happen in excruciating detail, bullet by bullet  the second column for each of those bullets, what you could do to minimize the likelihood of it happening, and then in the last column, what you could do to get back to where you are now  it could be two months, six months, a year, if you had to, if each of those happened ''when you go through that exercise, you very quickly realize that 9 times out of 10, you re risking, say on a scale of 0 to 10 impact, a 2 or 3 negative transient or temporary setback, compared to a potential 9 or 10 semi permanent, positive impact  that makes the bet really easy, right? if i said to you, we re going to roll a six sided die  if i get a 1, you pay me a dollar, anything else, i pay you a dollar  you would take that all day long  so you start to realize that and you re able to take the emergency brake off, which is what prevents you from hitting the goals that you ve set  so fear setting would be my recommendation  either of you guys?''kevin rose  so just recommendations for year end?''tim ferriss  yeah, recommendations, thoughts, asks, sure ''kevin rose  sure, okay  a few things real quick  one, go see the movie, kubo  have you seen kubo? anyone seen kubo at all? it was amazing  stop motion animation like the nightmare before christmas  have you seen it?''tim ferriss  i haven t yet seen it ''kevin rose  ohmygod, it s so good  all right, so see that one  the birth of sak  is another one you ve got to watch  i highly recommend it  anyone see that at all?''tim ferriss  sak , sak , eagle scout, sak  ''kevin rose  and then i would say my last one is on the meditation front  obviously, everyone talks about meditation  it s like the hot topic these days  we ve all played with headspace and calm and a few other apps  i will say that my biggest insight in the last six months has been that when you do the 10 or 15 minute little trial and get going, you do it and you think okay, i tried that and you put it away for a while  if you stick with it and you just go a little bit deeper, things start to unlock and i feel like the stress level and everything else just kind of plummets ''obviously, i m just a couple years into this whole world, but i feel like i didn t know that in the early days  i thought that i had tried it and i kind of gave up  i would say that in the last few months, it s really started to have a deeper impact on me when i dedicate more time to it  it s hard to find the time, but if you can set aside the 20  minutes a day, i think that s when you really start to see what it s all about or at least get a glimpse of what it s all about versus the really lightweight, 10 minutes i tried it and i m done kind of thing ''matt mullenweg  do you track that differently from your win hof time?''kevin rose  yeah, completely different  yeah, the 20 minutes i find for me is kind of the magic number, in the sense that like you said, 10 definitely reduces stress  10 after, for me at least, you know, 20 minutes, 15 minutes in, it s like okay, now the mud is finally settled and the water s actually clear for a few minutes and it s those few minutes that are so impactful  matt?''matt mullenweg  i realize i didn t get to assign you a 2017 goal  oh, all right  here we go ''matt mullenweg  so i m going to mix those in  i think a 2016 one which i m going to carry forward, but you can t really tell whether it s done or not, is everything in moderation  i m so bad at that  okay ''matt mullenweg  yeah, you re good at everything except moderation  yeah, this is true  all right ''matt mullenweg  so that s my challenge  moderation, all right ''matt mullenweg  but the specific thing i ll ask of you and the audience, you all already have tim s book  i m about halfway, three fifths in  loving it  i ll recommend two other books that are coming out  one is coming out in the beginning of january  it s called rebirth, from a mutual friend of ours  that s right ''matt mullenweg  kamal ravikant  which is actually about a story going on the camino santiago  el camino santiago  i forget the name  i m probably messing it up  that s close enough ''matt mullenweg  yeah  really beautiful book  and (2) which was probably the best book not written by tim i ve read in the past five years, is called becoming wise by krista tippett  it s got a longer subtitle  so that s the other challenge to you  i would love to see you interview and then later be interviewed by krista tippett  cool  yeah, i d love to do that ''matt mullenweg  it s actually very similar to tools of titans in that she has interviewed hundreds of amazing folks, but focused more on philosophy   theological and philosophical and existential ''matt mullenweg  sometimes theological, yeah  it s actually really fascinating and opened my mind in a lot of ways  much like your stuff, i came out with a ton of notes and a ton of things to read, like going to the source materials and everything like that  so that would be   if you like tim s stuff, i think you d also like her stuff  it s almost like a different side of the same coin  yeah, agreed  no, i think   i have her book  i think it s very  ''matt mullenweg  oh, cool    complementary, absolutely ''matt mullenweg  have you read it though?''tim ferriss  i have ''matt mullenweg  darn, you re ahead of it  check  all right, guys  please give a hand   kevin rose, matt mullenweg ''kevin rose  thanks, guys '"
216,224,"The Random Show with Kevin Rose (#224: The Random Show – Drinking Urine, Exploring Japan, and Figuring Out Life)","'he s incredible and also, hilarious  we really just banter and talk about our favorite things, new discoveries, what we re up to  in this particular episode, we discuss japan and how to do it cheaply, how to do it in a very, very fun way, different recommendations  we talk about building apps  kevin is extremely good at this  and the exact process, we brainstorm out loud and discuss things we haven t gotten into before ''we ll talk about urine drinking   long story  we ll get to that   love and marriage and difficulties therein and thereof, beauty and absurdity in 2017  why kevin doesn t have new year s resolutions this year, favorite books, and much, much more  we do talk about japan a fair bit but lest we bore some percentage of you guys who aren t really into japan, i would also, recommend you check out some of my collected thoughts on my favorite recommended bucket list items, as well as cheap or free diversions and incredible options in places like tokyo ''and you can find that in a two part blog post  you can go to tim blog japan  this is all free and it shows you how to get the most out of tokyo for less than, say, a trip to new york  so, it is a fun post  it s one i put a lot of thought into and had friends help me with, as well  tim blog japan  if you ve ever thought about japan, fantasized about going to japan, why don t we get that on the calendar for you and this will help you plan a lot of it and to spend your money very, very wisely  tim blog japan ''so, without further ado, please enjoy this episode of the random show with kevin rose,  on twitter and all the socials  it is late  i ve had a lot of sake  enjoy ''hello boys and girls  this is tim ferriss ''kevin rose  and i m kevin rose  hello, friends  long time no chat  long time no chat,  speaking japanese   the last one is effectively  long time no see  in japanese, which is appropriate because we are here for a special edition of the random show in kanazawa, japan ''kevin rose  that s right  why are we in japan, kevin?''kevin rose  well, that s a good question  it s been awhile since we ve been  last time we were on this side of the world was china  no, no  it was when you got engaged ''kevin rose  that s right! you were out here  i got engaged in tokyo for the cherry blossom festival, and you were here and we ended up hanging out  but this is my 40th birthday yesterday, which is kind of nuts  so, we did a little trip, invited six or so, really close friends and yeah, it s been a ton of fun  we re sitting here in a very traditional japanese style inn, ryokan, and we re sitting on tatami mats  we have a low table in front of us, we re sitting cross legged and we have some booze  we ve already had a fair amount of sake so, instead, we ve switched gears  i have some red wine, you have whatever that is ''kevin rose  i have a suntory premium malt beer, which is brewed with pride, is what it says on the outside there  japanese do everything with pride ''kevin rose  everything with pride  i love it ''kevin rose  i love it  cheers  kanpai ''kevin rose  kanpai  so, kanpai   we ll do a couple of language things and then we ll get into our usual random odds and ends, bits and pieces  but kampi is  empty glass,  and that is cheers in japanese and chinese  same characters  gambi, also,  empty glass  ''kevin rose  but the funny thing is, you told me this  it doesn t mean chug  it doesn t mean chug ''kevin rose  no, most people think when you say kampi, you just put it straight back, you chug it, boom, done, slam the glass, that s it  which is not true, yeah ''kevin rose  but there s another word  there is ''kevin rose  what is it again?''tim ferriss  iki ''kevin rose  iki  so, if you go iki, iki  iki, iki, iki  iki, iki is one breath, one breath  and that means chug ''kevin rose  okay  so, different uses, to be used sparingly or all the time, in case of k  rose  and we are at adaia, as the name of the place  and if you hear any waterfall like sounds in the background, that is because we have a natural onsen bringing water into the rooms where there are wooden tubs that are effectively indoor outdoor  there s an open wall so, you look out into a forest hillside, and the steam pours out into the great outdoors  it is winter so, there s tons of fog and mist and so, on  it s just a magical place ''kevin rose  it s absolutely beautiful  one of the reasons i chose this place to stay is one, i had never stayed in a ryokan, like a traditional japanese house before and i always wanted to do that ''and no  2, when you re talking about an onsen like a natural spring, it s very difficult because in japan, if you have any tattoos whatsoever, you are forbidden from doing the onsen  the public baths ''kevin rose  public baths because they say you are a yakuza  yeah, it s associated with organized crime  so, if you have tattoos, as kevin does   my little pony on both deltoids ''kevin rose  they re beautiful  i got the long haired with the tassels  it s quite a breathtaking thing  it is breathtaking  you are not allowed to go to public baths, or most of them  also, true in, say, hotels where they have beachfront  you re not allowed to go on the beach if you have exposed tattoos ''kevin rose  yeah, and also, hotels when you re going to just use their spa  because i went in there one time, i was staying at i think the peninsula, and i went in to use the spa and she goes,  tattoos?  and i said,  yes   she handed me flesh colored tape, like a little square of tape ''and i have a few, and i was like,  i m going to need the whole roll   it didn t actually happen  i didn t go in  i would have been kicked out  but this is nice  it s in a room  every single room has its own little private bath, hot water being piped in and it s been very relaxing  i should say also,   we re not going to talk about japan the whole time, but i do think japan is worth highlighting for a few reasons  i was an exchange student here when i was 15, which was really my first time abroad  that year completely changed my life  i lived with host families  i went to a japanese school  i was the only american in my class photo, which was very easy  where s waldo?  all in school uniforms ''crew cut, white head and then all japanese kids, about 5,000  it has proven to be such a subtle and nuanced culture  simultaneously you can come here as someone who doesn t speak japanese, get completely lost, be completely bewildered  the english level is generally pretty low here so, it can be a totally alien environment where you can t read any signs, and it s not dangerous ''kevin rose  right  and the people will go above and beyond to try and decipher what you re saying with your hands  not only that, why don t you tell the story of tony and the earphones?''kevin rose  what earphones?''tim ferriss  the earphones that he dropped in the  inaudible   '' crosstalk ''kevin rose  oh, yeah  so, two days ago   well, there were two stories  this is classic tokyo for you  it s part of the reason why i love japan so, much  the people here are just so, friendly and really concerned with your well being  tony, one of the members that is traveling with us, he dropped his headphones ''we re talking standard, kind of apple headphones  white cord, whatever  we walked into a coffee shop  just for context, this is on one of the busiest streets in a shopping district in tokyo ''kevin rose  yes  fifth avenue in new york city ''kevin rose  yeah, just like all over the place, probably stepping on the headphones and whatnot  somebody on the second floor of a building across the street was looking out the window, saw that these small white headphones fell out of his pocket, ran down the stairs, grabbed the headphones, figured out which coffee bar we had gone into and then proceeded to enter in and hand back the headphones, which was just nuts  and then on top of that, the exact same coffee bar, i had gotten out of a taxi, left my cell phone in the taxi  of course, when you re in the states, you re like shit, my cell phone s gone  i m never gonna see it again ''so, i used find my phone, the apple built in feature so, you can see where your phone is  i used it off my wife s cell phone  it s 20, 25 minutes away from where we re at in a taxi  i m like  oh, dammit, how am i ever going to get this back? i pressed the button which sends a signal to the cell phone and it sends out an audible alert so, anyone who is nearby can hear that  all of a sudden, i m watching on gps, the phone starts getting closer and closer and closer ''this drive drives all the way back, 20 plus minutes, comes up the stairs to the coffee shop where i had left him, and then hands me my phone back  i try to tip him  i m thinking in the states, you give somebody  20,  40,  50  thank you so, much  he wouldn t accept my tip and was just so, polite  bowed to me and left  man, when you live in the states, you re just like what happened?''tim ferriss  we have a few friends with us, and it also, makes you feel in many, many instances an uncivilized, hairy savage ''kevin rose  that s what i m saying!''tim ferriss  you wake up knowing you re going to be ashamed of at least 17 things that you do that day ''kevin rose  that s right  but it s a wonderful environment  one thing i want to underscore before we move on, and i m sure we ll come back to it, is that you don t have to have a lot of money or spend a lot of money to enjoy tokyo  this is a common misconception  it can be extremely expensive but it doesn t have to be extremely expensive  and certainly japan as a whole doesn t need to be extremely expensive  when i was here at 15, i had no money whatsoever  you can, for instance, find stores that you would recognize, like 7 11, that are completely different from the equivalent at home ''you can go into a 7 11, for instance, and you can grab one of my favorite on the go bites, which is onigiri  these are rice balls wrapped in dry seaweed and filled with various meats, vegetables, or fish  say tuna or whatever it might be  those typically cost about 110 yen, so, let s just call that  1 00  you can find those at 7 11, a store called sunkus, or lawson  it s packaged in such a way that you pull apart the plastic which keeps the seaweed separate, and it automatically wraps this rice triangle, and you have effectively an entire meal right there for somewhere between  1 00 and  2 00 ''kevin rose  you know it s funny  i don t know if i told you this but i was out here with david chang, who is i would say   i m sure a lot of people are familiar with him but he s probably one of the top five chefs in the united states  very famous, momofuku, milk bar ''kevin rose  yeah, milk bar  we happened to be here on the same trip with some friends  hew as ranting and raving about the 7 11 egg salad sandwich''this chef has three mission stars at one of his restaurants  a top of the world chef freaking out about a 7 11  different 7 11 than in the united states  not high in food by any means  a couple bucks for this egg salad sandwich but prepared with   like my beer says,  prepared with pride   a couple of other go tos i d suggest in tokyo, if you can get a ticket, go to the ghibli museum  think of it as the disney museum for the walt disney of japan  that s miyazaki hayao  he did spirited way, my favorite movie, my neighbor totoro  a whole, long list of blockbuster and genre defining anime films  it is one of the most incredible museums i ve ever been to  it s in the middle of what they call mitaka forest, which is right next to   or is   inokashira koen ''a lot of things in japan are also, free  you can go to harajuku, where you can find on the weekends elvis impersonators doing their dancing  this has been going on for decades, now  and you can also, go to takeshita dori, which is i guess takeshita street or alleyway where you find dozens or hundreds of teenagers and high schoolers doing cosplay  so, they wear these crazy outfits and walk up and down the streets showing off the weirdest outfits imaginable ''kevin rose  some people are into that  a lot of people are into it ''kevin rose  when you see a cosplay  because it s like a sexual thing  i think for some people that might be part of it, but i think it s just a form of hyper expression in a culture where a lot of people feel very repressed over overly polite most of the time ''so, then they blow it out on the weekends and put in pink contacts and white hair, and 12 inch platform shoes and wear the wackiest shit imaginable to waltz around in ''kevin rose  maybe in the states, cosplay is a bigger  they dress up like video game characters and things like that, like comic con and whatnot  oh, yeah ''kevin rose  that s not really japanese cosplay, though  there are a lot of things that are regular in other countries that end up being adopted by weird niche groups in the u s  and take on, in some cases, creepier and weirder elements  like tango in argentina, normal  tango in some places in the united states  super weird  i m just saying that as someone who loves tango and dances in many places but primarily in argentina way back in the day ''same thing with japanese stuff  it s like oh, manga, cool and then you find a little subculture in a given city in the u s , and you re like wait a second, it s all 40 year old guys who are reading creepy, half porno hanta manga  okay, i don t think i m going to hang out here anymore ''kevin rose  right  segue  how do we segue from that? let s segue from henta  henta you can look up  there are two books that have helped me review and prep for this trip in terms of japanese that i d like to suggest people check out if you re interested in japanese  very short, and i was able to get through these really quickly  the first is probably for people who speak more intermediate japanese, so, you d want some basics first  but it is 13 secrets for speaking fluent japanese, and this is by giles murray ''so, 13 secrets for speaking fluent japanese  very, very helpful  the second may be a bit dry for some people but i like very concise grammar summaries that are quick reference  this is japanese verbs and essentials of grammar, by rita lampkin ''you were mentioning before we started recording an app, apps, and app development ''kevin rose  yes  you said you wanted to talk about it ''kevin rose  yeah, we can kind of segue into just what we ve been up to lately, because that s what we do at the random show if you ve tuned into previous episodes where we just get hammered and talk about weird stuff  i wanted to get your take on this and kind of do a real time, hashing out  because i haven t told you anything about it  well, i ve told you a little bit about it but i think it would be fun to do an on air help and show people what it s like to brainstorm some of this stuff  sure ''kevin rose  so, here s the deal  in my career, for people who know me and don t know me, i built a bunch of different software applications, both on the web and mobile, and worked at google for a few years, and have done investing and things of that nature ''recently i ve gotten back into building apps, so, i built an app around fasting that helps people do intermittent fasting that i wanted to give away for free, so, that s a completely free app  it s called zero  then i wanted to do another app recently around meditation  meditation has been a hobby of mine on and off, i will say like most of our friends who meditate, for probably the last three or four years  i took a course in transcendental meditation here probably six months ago, really enjoyed it  mantra based meditation, so, when i say mantra i m talking about you receive a word, you repeat that word over and over again ''you ve done this before, tim, obviously  and you kind of go into more of a  what would you call that state? it s almost like a hypnosis type state when you re doing the word over and over again, very relaxing ''anyway, a different form of meditation versus a general mindfulness meditation  one of the things i was thinking about for this app is to actually go completely public on the soup to nuts creation of the application  so, starting off by showing the wireframes, doing weekly video and showing off how you make certain decisions around app design, how you make usability, tradeoffs  what gets included in the app and what gets excluded ''how you have to rerecord audio because you don t like certain pieces of the audio you re putting together  there are a thousand things that go into app creation  but it s also, really scary because at the same time, when anyone, any new entrepreneur is developing anything new, you kind of want to keep it close to the vest a little bit because it s kind of like your own secret sauce  it s your own proprietary stuff  what do you think about going out, going very public?''because you are a very guarded guy  about some things, yeah ''kevin rose  but having known you for many years now, when you re working on a new book and i ve seen you now through many books, you won t even share chapters of the book  you keep that stuff very close and very tight  what are your thoughts either way on doing something like this?''tim ferriss  books are a unique animal to me in that respect, where i feel like memes can inadvertently be released into the wild and gain traction in ways that are unforeseen if you start talking about a book that is going to take potentially three years to do, too early  then that can create ''kevin rose  knockoffs  knockoffs and maybe push the way forward in such a way that you were paddling in the perfect place and now you re going to be six, 12 months or more late to a party where you would have a superior product ''but since you re not the first to market, you re not the first to mindshare  with books, i think that crowd sourcing ideas and feedback is most valuable in my experience when you have a clear idea first of what you would like to do, and then you use the wisdom of crowds to select from options that are of equal appeal to you  in other words, if you say alright, we re going to include one of these three features but we only have the manpower to focus on one, i like all three equally  let s let the crowd decide ''i find that very actionable and helpful in many cases  but what should i write about and let me just pick and choose and make a frankenstein s monster  i find that very, very difficult  but in the case of an app, from where you are now to potential launch, what type of timeline are we looking at?''kevin rose  three months  i wouldn t be worried at all ''kevin rose  yeah, i m not too concerned about it  i m just curious  it s a lot of work, obviously, to air it all out there because you don t want to be this one way communication where you just are pushing out content and you re not taking in feedback  so, i was going to do a custom slack group where i invited in a few hundred people, have them listen to the different various meditations as they re being developed because i m going to do both male and female voices, guided meditations  i want to be the first app to actually teach mantra meditation  nachos, nachos, nachos ''kevin rose  nachos  that is not going to be one of the mantras  so, anyway, it s a new thing for me  because in building so, many different pieces of software over the years, when i started digg ten years ago, and read it, and we had competitors around  we were very cautious about which features we launched because they were getting cloned so, quickly ''almost like you said, whereas if you put this idea out there for a genre, all of a sudden you can have ten or 15 other books spring up before yours is actually out there and they gain mindshare  so, i don t know  it s potentially me being just a little bit gun shy, here  i would just say that i do small, i would say, test group development for a lot of the content that goes into my books ''kevin rose  this is what you did for your first book cover, right, or the name of it?''tim ferriss  i did google adwords testing ''kevin rose  didn t you also, print out covers and put them on a book? tell people that story  i did  this is a story fewer people know  a lot of people have heard about how i used google adwords  i had about half a dozen titles and subtitles that were of equal appeal in effect for the four hour work week ''i tested them on google adwords for  150 or  200 over the span of a week, and figured out very quickly   or google figured out for me   which combination worked best to maximize click through  then that just went to an under construction work page  but the other way that i tested was i printed out sample covers, different covers once the title had been decided and wrapped them around books that were the same size, and put them up on shelves at the borders that used to exist on university avenue in palo alto  and i sat there keeping track of how many people picked up different covers ''kevin rose  based on the title  based on the cover ''kevin rose  based on the cover design  that s right ''kevin rose  okay, because you had already decided the title  yes  so, i d swap the covers every hour or so, and just stand there, watching ''kevin rose  what were some of the covers? do you remember what they looked like?''tim ferriss  it was mostly color scheme  there were some design elements ''but i test, i do test  i would say a few things  no  1, you could capture the process and then release those after the app is launched  i think that would still be of equal value  i don t think you need to broadcast them while you are still in development  i don t think that s a necessity  quick question for you, though, because i ve wondered about this myself  i use slack internally for a lot of my work with my team ''but i ve heard mixed reviews about slack channels for communities  some people seem to love it  i ve had other people, who will remain unnamed, who say don t do it  it s a huge headache  why use a slack channel as opposed to, say, a private facebook group?''kevin rose  it s a great question  i actually thought about both  i might go facebook  the problem with slack is due to the nature that it is just a real time chat, i think that the expectation is a more immediate response from you, versus it being just a general post in a facebook group which you can get back to in a day or two  you and i are both really busy people  i have a feeling i will go facebook  and slack has a cap, too  slack also, doesn t have nested comments ''kevin rose  they just added something like that just a week ago  did they? because that drives me insane ''kevin rose  it s not nested comments but it s kind of like sub threads around a single comment  right, that s what i mean ''kevin rose  it doesn t show up as a straight nest in the timeline, though  you kind of click through it  it s a little bit funkier than a standard nested comment  but yeah, they ve added that  can i add a side note?''kevin rose  yeah  just in case anyone from facebook is listening to this, request   please, pretty please   if i could sort my comments by most liked or up voted  that would make my life so, much easier ''kevin rose  where?''tim ferriss  on my fan page, on facebook com timferriss  when i poll people or when i ask my audience for feedback on things, like  hey, for 1,000 square feet or less, what type of yurt or small house should i build on such and such a plot? then i get all these incredible responses  i ve asked some people at facebook about this  there s no clear way that i have found to sort by most likes  isn t that crazy?''kevin rose  don t they have a sort by most interesting or something like that?''tim ferriss  they have sort by best, or top, or something like that but it s an algorithm  it s not a straightforward most liked indicator  so, go figure  but why meditation? what s driving you to do it and what does success for you look like? say you launch it in three months, three months after that how will you know if it has been successful or not?''kevin rose  a couple things  why, i ve seen changes in my own body, in my own feelings in terms of just reducing anxiety and overall just happiness in general, and just giving me a little bit of space  to be honest, there are a lot of great apps out there  i think calm and headspace are two great ones  definitely ''kevin rose  i ve used both of them for many, many sessions  when i started taking tm, that transcendental meditation that teaches mantra based meditation, it was a very expensive process  for most people, spending  1,500 on a three day course is a big chunk of their pay  mantra meditation, don t get me wrong  there s a lot of coaching there that tm provides that i think is really valuable  but i think the concept is pretty straightforward ''honestly, i m at the point in my career where knock on wood, i ve done fairly well in terms of investing and other things that i ve done, and this isn t about creating a big, multimillion dollar business  it s about putting something out there that the world will enjoy, that is free, that people can get into  i want to make an app that teaches both mindfulness and the more breath work based mindfulness meditation as well as mantra meditation  i should have said breath work being a separate category  so, teaching the kind of yoga breath work, and then a way to layer on some light social features  one of the things that none of these apps do is allow you to engage really in a community with your friends in a social way ''it s a very difficult thing because you want to make sure this isn t an ego driven thing  it s not about oh, i meditated more than you so, i m better  it s more about encouraging each other to have a regular practice  i ve built a lot of social apps in the past, and i m hoping i can tread lightly there and get the right mixture of features that are both high quality, guided meditation along with unguided meditation, for which i ve got some really amazing and beautiful different chimes and gong sounds to bring you back to your awareness  how about duck sounds? quack, quack ''kevin rose  we can put ducks tim ferriss  here if you want  we can have a little tim tim shout out if you want  whatever you d like  it s one of those things that when you re an app developer and you start using apps, they never fit you because you didn t build it ''so, i look at these apps and i m like i love them, they re great but they re not what i would build so, i just want to have my own little take on it  for me, success doesn t mean 10 million people using it  if i can just attract some more people to get into meditation and find a little bit more space in their lives and a little bit less stress, i ll be happy  what is the motivation behind wanting to share the step by step? like you said, it s a lot of work to do that well ''kevin rose  one of the things, if you ve taken a look at the podcasts that i ve done in the past on my own through the journal podcast or the foundation series, it has been this theme of interviewing entrepreneurs to encourage other people and let other people realize that entrepreneurs are just like anyone else ''so, if they can see how we make mistakes along the way, because to get to a final product, to get to a 1 0 version that you launch, you change your mind 50, 75, 100 different times before you actually launch something  there will be so, many times where i ll build something, i ll get it in my hands  meaning build it in wireframes, build it in design  just for those people who don t know the term, what are wireframes?''kevin rose  wireframes are essentially what i use and what most people use as their very first layout  meaning let s say you re going to design the front page of instagram as an app  you would draw a box and type in  picture goes here   you would draw a circle and say  user profile photo goes here   it s like storyboarding ''kevin rose  yes, it s a blueprint  it s a house blueprint  visual flowchart with different actions ''kevin rose  exactly  if  click this  goes to this page, if  click this  goes to that, if  turn on post notifications  does this  so, it s a very complex series ''they call it wireframes because it is like wire boxes  then you get that on the phone so, you can kind of tap around  so, you make these mock ups you can actually tap on with your finger and walk through  oftentimes you ll be like oh, that doesn t feel right, or gosh, i wish this icon was over here, or this doesn t make sense  so, there s a lot of iteration that goes into that  i know so, many people or potential entrepreneurs who have talked to me in the past have always said i m scared to make that leap and i don t think i have it in me ''and i think if i can expose to people how many mistakes we all make in building these things, that maybe they ll think gosh, i can do this, too  i just want to encourage more creativity amongst would be entrepreneurs, if that makes sense  it does make sense  let me ask you a question that i ve already asked you but we didn t really get into ''i ve been fascinated by and used apps for a really long time for all sorts of things  and like many people out there, i ve had some ideas for apps  i ve had listeners and readers of mine request apps from me for different things ''kevin rose  you could easily have an app, a very popular app, i m sure  but my fear has been not the onus of designing a good app, which i think with the people that i know, with the people that you know, with people i have access to and maybe even people listening to this podcast who want to help, that designing a good app is achievable  my fear has always been to do that and then be on the hook for updating indefinitely for the rest of my life every week, every day, whatever it might be  that you re just at that point caught in a very taxing and labor intensive maintenance mode  and you said no, you just have to design it right the first time, or something along those lines ''could you elaborate on that? because the fear, and this comes from a place maybe that is no longer relevant but having used for instance vbulletin as a bulletin board ''kevin rose  vbulletin, oh, my god  it was just like every day was a fire drill  there was some type of vulnerability or botched something ''kevin rose  explain to people what that is, for people who don t know  that s old school talk right there  vbulletin was a very popular bulletin board software ''kevin rose  a message board  message board  if you wanted to build a forum or something along those lines, you could use vbulletin  the amount of headache, and spam infiltration, and moderation, and nonsense that my team and i had to deal with on probably a weekly basis was just unbelievable, primarily because of updates that were either completed improperly or sometimes completed, or additional bug fixes needed  it was really a big headache ''of course when i pick up my iphone almost every day it s like 37 notifications on the app store ''kevin rose  new updates, yeah  new updates for every app  how can you minimize the amount of maintenance that goes into something like that?''kevin rose  let me put it to you this way  some things have gotten a hell of a lot better  some things still require a little bit of work  let me start with what s gotten better  back in the day when you built an application for the web or anything else, you had to host your own software  so, roll your own servers, there were times when digg was taking off and gosh, we had 38 million people using our site every month  i had i want to say 75 to 100 servers that we physically would move into a location and rack mount  screw them in, hook them up  you had to touch the actual metal  so, amazon was the first one to really take over ''then maybe rackspace and a couple others decided okay, we know that s a headache  let s get rid of that problem and actually allow sys admins to interact with the servers but they don t actually have to touch the metal  we ll do all the rack mounting for them  so, now, fast forward to today, a lot of this stuff is magic ''when i say magic, meaning that google and amazon and a few others have really created these automatically scaling databases and services that you can essentially, if you pay them enough money, automatically scale  i ll give you an example  let s say you create an application, and you re like okay, this looks like a fun little social photo sharing application  back in the day, you d have one little rented server that you paid  99 00 a month for ''and if you become popular, your server falls over, it stops working, you re screwed  you re running all over the place  you re paying people to rack mount more servers for you  google and many others   microsoft and all the big players these days   have figured out that they will handle all of that and automatically scale things for you  they ve created certain types of databases and other services that more or less automatically scale  so, if you become snapchat overnight, it s just a matter of dollars going in  it s just a matter of your credit limit on your amex that you have on file ''kevin rose  exactly  so, there s none of that concern anymore, and that s the nice piece that s been taken care of  so, we re talk about amazon web services? what are some of the others?''kevin rose  microsoft, heroku to some extent even though it s a little bit more managed and sits on top of amazon  oracle has some stuff that plays in this space  all the big players  all the usual suspects ''kevin rose  exactly  so, the thing that is difficult, the one thing that is tough, is that you still manage the application  so, if you re building an app, let s just say snapchat for example, and you want to make a change to a feature in your app  so, if you have the tim ferris app and you re like okay, i want to feature podcasts but guess what, i want to add blog posts now, too  you have to write that additional change  or, if there s a bug in your app, you have to fix that bug and push out a new release ''or if there s a new ios version that comes out that deprecates some of the old features that were in your old ios version, you have to then upgrade your version of the software, rewrite some code, and then rerelease it  so, long story short, and trying to get less technical, you maintain the app  the back end, what scales and allows people to use it is a lot easier to scale  but you still have to make sure to support your app and keep it current  what should the expectation be, then? let s not make it abstract  if i did a long weekend jam session, came up with some wireframes with a couple of competent folks, just ground it out with a lot of caffeine and then went into development  you said three months  let s say i gave myself and the team three to six months to ship and got it out there  okay, boom, it goes out  what should my expectations be in terms of maintenance for the next year if it has moderate popularity? it s not snapchat but it also, just doesn t die on the vine ''kevin rose  within the first 48 hours there are going to be a bunch of bugs that show up, just because you have a mass of people using it for the first time  that s to be expected  happens with books, too, by the way  oh, shit, i misspelled my own name on the cover page  great ''kevin rose  right, a little bit easier to fix in the app world ''so, that s going to happen and you have to push a pretty quick release out after that  but again, it s a few little code fixes and you submit it to the app store and it goes right out and everybody gets the update, at least those who choose to update  then it s just a matter of usage in terms of dollars  so, with an audience of your size, let s say you have a few hundred thousand people using it ''if it s pretty image intense, that s going to cost you some money  you could be thousands of dollars a month  that s not out of the question  you know, i have an app called zero, the little fasting app  it doesn t require any back end which is awesome because it s all localized on the phone  so, i don t have to pay anything for that  it just runs  it s just like a software program that runs on the phone ''kevin rose  right, exactly  it stores all the data locally  all that good stuff  so, that s really easy  if yours is just pulling an rss feed and making a really easy way for people to have a conversation and enjoy your podcast, that s a pretty straightforward thing that s not going to cost you a lot of money ''you probably wouldn t even need a back end to do all of that  so, it s just the cost of actually developing the app  that can range anywhere from a few thousand dollars to 10 or  15,000  in terms of cost, i m not concerned so, much of the cost of bandwidth ''kevin rose  maintenance is not a ton, by the way  it s more managing developers  it s like  oh shit, apple rewrote the book and came out with an os that makes half of the app obsolete ''kevin rose  it s never that drastic, though  they always give you a lot of time  any time apple makes a major change and they say this is going to be deprecated, it s always a year, and you re not going to be rewriting stuff from the ground up  there was a point where that happens every few years, like apple will move from objective c to swift, which is their new programming language which they did a few years ago  but still, they support the old stuff  so, it s not the end of the world ''the upside is huge  you have the ability to push notifications  any time someone that s listening to this, when you receive one of those push notifications, that is such a very powerful way to pull people back into your brand and back into your product  you re top of mind, then  like how else right now can tim ferriss tell you about something new in his life? via twitter? sure, but how many people are actually going to be on twitter?''tim ferriss  no, twitter is like throwing a golf ball into niagara falls and hoping somebody sees it ''kevin rose  right, you hope somebody sees it  on facebook, you could boost the post and get a few more people to see it, and you d pay a few dollars there  but when you own your own app and you get people to opt in for those push notifications, those are real, actionable things that people swipe into and then they re back into your experience  so, the engagement is really high and worthwhile  what i ve fantasized about is, for instance, having the ability to centralize all the various bits and pieces of the experiments and so, on that i m doing in one place  so, you d have the social feeds and all that stuff within the app, but then you d have the podcast  and when i m traveling, as i do a lot, if i m in nashville, or i m in tokyo, or i m in detroit, wherever it might be, i could actually send post notifications based on location to people within a 100 mile radius ''kevin rose  oh, absolutely  it s called geofencing  yeah, geofencing  so, it s like in two days, i m going to buy drinks for anyone who wants to swing by joe s bar at this time on this night and just push it out to people who are in that zone ''kevin rose  i ve told you you should build your own app  it doesn t have to be that crazy  start out with something people can just opt into, get some great updates from you and you can slowly expand it over time  that s the one thing that i always try and encourage people to do, is this doesn t have to be everything on day one ''that s the beauty of software updates  take your laundry list of 15 features that you would like to see in the next two years, narrow it down to three to five that you must have for a version 1 0, and go launch with that  well who is it, reid hoffman has said if you re not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you shipped too late?''kevin rose  that s right  that s great advice  which doesn t apply necessarily to books, by the way but software that you can update quickly, for sure  so, what else is new, man?''kevin rose  gosh, that s kind of my focus right now  i ve been bouncing around doing different board advisory stuff, doing a little bit of angel investing, helping out hodinkee where i spent a bunch of time there, and building apps  so, this is going to be my new thing  i want to get into your stuff but the last thing i will say is if people do want to join all this stuff, i have an email newsletter called the journal ''just head on over to thejournal email, and you can sign up there and i will send you a way to take part in this meditation app  i d love to have you try it out and tell me what you think  but i want to know what you ve been up to because you ve been busy as hell! i feel like when i first invited you to the birthday thing out here in japan, i didn t know if you were going to make it because you ve been doing the book launch madness tour  yeah, that s effectively wrapped up  what a lot of people don t realize is that i ve never done a technical book tour  i m actually going to have a mini documentary coming out soon about this  i hired for the first time ever a videographer to follow me around during week one of the tools of titans book launch, which ended up putting it at no 1 new york times ''it s the first time i ve head a book in consecutive weeks from the get go on the new york times no 1, and he tracked the whole thing so, you get to see behind the scenes  the point i was going to make is that i do two weeks in new york, typically in late november, early december  then i take a breather over the holidays, and then i hit the ground running again on the west coast this time for two weeks  and that s it  that s effectively the book launch, keeping in mind that a lot has been set up and put in motion months before the actual publication date ''so, there are things that are locked and loaded and ready to go on day one, or day zero i guess  the book launch is a 24 7 engagement, at least i treat it that way  because i would rather overdo it or over commit by 20 percent and feel like i ve left everything on the playing field, than to dial it back, go 80 percent, hit no  2 or no  3  i m very competitive so, i don t respond well to that ''kevin rose  congrats on that, man  you hit it  thank you  but it s like i d rather overdo it for a short period of time and leave no doubt that i did everything that could have been effective, rather than going 70 or 80 percent, not hitting the goal and then ask myself at every point thereafter, what if? like what if i d done that extra 20 percent? it was a spectacular experience  that is now effectively wrapped up  really the two last events, being on jimmy fallon which was fantastic  did some acro yoga with jimmy who listens to the podcast   hey, jimmy  i had a fantastic time ''kevin rose  jimmy s awesome  you ve spent time with him  for people who wonder, jimmy is everyone you would hope him to be ''he is the sweetest, most encouraging, most positive guy you could imagine  it s so, noticeable, and i m not going to name names but i ve been on a lot of media  tv jobs are really hard jobs  i m not talking about jimmy, although his job is very hard  i m talking about everybody  it is a really tough business  the staff on that show are happy people  like they were joking around, having a good time  it was a really, really exciting and affirming culture to observe when i went on the show  there was jimmy fallon, and then there was the castro theater event that i did in san francisco  that was effectively the tail end of it  so, right now, i m in a period of slack ''kevin rose  how does that make you feel?''tim ferriss  you know, i m practicing getting more comfortable with that  i like to have a big thing in the works  i like to have a round in the chamber ready to go  you and i are both good at setting goals and then backing into that goal, setting a timeline  just like you re working on your apps, right? you think about it very methodically and that is fantastic for achievement but it makes you very future focused  i think that you can leave appreciation and happiness on the table a lot of the time if you re always future focused  so, i m trying to deliberately not have an immediate, huge project to jump into next  how does that make me feel? i ll be honest  at times, very uneasy  because i feel like things are red hot  i feel like there s a lot of encouragement from other people to strike while the iron is hot  and i think selectively, that s not bad advice ''i remember b j  novak said to me once on this podcast, in fact, and i m paraphrasing but he said if will smith doesn t do a movie after three years, people aren t like  where s will smith? that guy hasn t done anything  if you have some degree of talent or ability, you can get other people s attention again if you have to  and so, i think that sense of urgency, where it s like no, i have to another big thing or else  or else what?''i don t think that pressure is intrinsically healthy or helpful, necessarily  right now, i just finished reading this book  i think it s cal newport who wrote a book called deep work, just about really mitigating the reactivity that a lot of people experience on a daily or weekly basis to focus on different types of deep work ''whether that s blocking out three hours in the morning, whether that s blocking out a day a week, whether that s blocking out a few weeks a year as bill gates does to effectively go off the grid and do a lot of deep reading and deep thinking  having some type of commitment and scheduling in advance that allows you to do that is something i ve been thinking about a lot  so, this year i ve been proactively looking through 2017 and blocking out extended periods of time for unknown purposes ''kevin rose  i was curious about those unknown purposes because i would say i first met you when you launched your first book at the launch party, the four hour work week  yeah, the hunt for red october ''kevin rose  yeah, on the boat  on the ss jeremiah working homeland security warship  it s for rent in san francisco ''kevin rose  you can rent out a boat for a party  it s actually a pretty bad ass old warship  but the one thing that i ve seen you do is you ve found your next thing every few months, or every six months or so, or something like that  sure ''kevin rose  what do you want your tombstone to read?''what s it going to be when you sum it all up, and you pass away? we re all going to die  what is tim ferriss at the end of the day?''tim ferriss  i don t think it would be something grandiose  i think it would be a teacher who always wanted his students to be better than he was  i think that s it  something along those lines ''kevin rose  you consider yourself a teacher, then?''tim ferriss  more than a writer, for sure  writing is just a vehicle for trying to impart things that i ve learned ''kevin rose  your writing are teachings, and everything you ve done has been about teaching, right?''tim ferriss  in some capacity, absolutely  or it s a tool that i use to teach  i always thought i was going to be a ninth or tenth grade teacher, actually  i think it s a very critical window for a lot of kids  i know it was for me ''it just so, happened that the book   and the podcast even more so, because it can be a secondary activity versus a book   provides an opportunity to reach more than, say, a classroom of 30 to 50 kids or fewer and takes it to the millions instead, which is a huge opportunity  and i think about it a lot  it s a huge opportunity  it s a huge responsibility not to squander it ''kevin rose  what do you want to teach people?''tim ferriss  i want to teach people how to think bigger, question the limitations that they ve set for themselves that have been absorbed from people around them, whether that s family, friends, critics, otherwise, and to test intelligently  to experiment intelligently ''i think if you do those three things, you re set for most things, at least in terms of goal achievement  if you train yourself, and by train, i mean practice in some systematic way, thinking big, questioning limitations that you ve accumulated or that you ve assimilated from other people, and then experimenting intelligently and knowing how to limit your losses and how to that downside in a non fearful way, if that makes sense ''in effect, learning to be able to ask what s the worst that can happen and then planning experiments within the boundaries  i think you re kind of set for most things  whether that s learning a language, building a huge business, helping a group of people overcome drug addiction  whatever it is i think those three are very, very critical ''kevin rose  when people look at what you ve done over the last few years, you ve launched a series of successful books, you just made the cover of entrepreneur magazine, which is awesome, i think from the outside looking in, and i ve been fortunate as well to have people ask me a very similar question which is what i want to ask you  they tend to think that people who have a little bit of success, they have it all figured out  people that have a little bit of success, they have it all figured out  i think in reality, at least for me, that s never been the case  what don t you have figured out?''tim ferriss  i think you could ask me what do you have figured out and i d have trouble coming up with answers and that list is a little bit easier ''kevin rose  what are things that you struggle with? i want to get a little deep here tonight  thinking about marriage and kids, for sure ''kevin rose  okay, marriage and kids so, relationships are tough  it s tough because if i m looking at it empirically as, say, an investor in certain social constructs ''kevin rose  why is that tough for you, though?''tim ferriss  hold on  as it s typically formed or organized, marriage does not have a good success rate  it just doesn t  empirically data driven in the united states just does not ''kevin rose  but this is the data driven side that i feel like you can t  how can you apply data to love?''tim ferriss  i think love  i was going to say it s necessary but not sufficient  but even love is not necessarily necessary for a successful marriage  i know that sounds weird but i know people who have had arranged marriages, learned to love each other over, say, 20 years and have wonderful families ''i know also, a higher percentage of people who were passionately in love, didn t think about long term compatibility or value orientation, and ended up imploding into a super nova of psychological and financial destruction  so, i haven t ruled out marriage  although i think it s largely unnecessary and unhelpful legal constructs in a lot of respects  kids are more interesting to me  those are a few areas in my life with a lot of variables involved, changing variables both known and unknown that is tricky  it s tricky  and i like to be really good at whatever i do ''kevin rose  i know you do  so, diving into something and being like  well, if it works out, it s gonna be awesome  if it doesn t, it could be like a complete disaster for myself and those i care about most ''that s not an easy leap of faith for me to make  so, those are two examples  there are plenty of things i don t have figured out ''kevin rose  let me ask you a question about love  oh, boy ''kevin rose  come on  yeah, i ll do it  i ll do it ''kevin rose  let me go a little bit deeper, here  have a little sip of wine  i ve been drinking so, much sake, this pinot noir tastes like sake, which is really weird ''kevin rose  we ve had a lot of sake tonight  so, the thing that you know is that you are a weird dude, and that s one of the reasons why we re friends and i think it s so, awesome is because we both like to get into really weird shit and kind of experiment on weird stuff  i ve gotta tell this story  i m sorry, tim  oh, god ''kevin rose  don t cut this out of the episode  you have the final file but don t cut it out  you told me in the car today  uh oh ''kevin rose  can i say it?''tim ferriss  sure  i don t know what s coming ''kevin rose  that you drank your own urine just because you were curious as to what it tasted like  let me back up  let me give some context, here  i have a friend ''kevin rose  ladies aren t running, knocking on your door  maybe a few but i don t know if it s marriage material  not in my bumbled profile  it s not usually what i lead with  uric acid forward  i ve met a few different folks over a relatively short period of time  one guy who said his aunt, i think it was, he was indian and he said his aunt drank her urine something like once a month for medicinal purposes, which didn t make a lot of sense to me  but i had read various accounts of people drinking urine, whether they re on a lifeboat or fill in the blank, right?''kevin rose  of course  of all of the weird things i ve done, and i have taken out whole blood samples, had them spun in centrifuges, re injected locally into injuries ''i ve had things like bmp compounds that i ve imported to inject into connective tissue  i ve done some very odd stuff  really, really odd stuff  i realized i had never had a sip of my own urine ''kevin rose  and you also, never ate a shit sandwich  that doesn t mean  i know  we were talking about this earlier because one of our friends was like, it s a slippery slope  i m like yeah, before you know it you re eating shit sandwiches for lunch  it s like no, not quite  so, yes, i m a weird guy and i did, over a sink because i thought i might puke, after a day of fantastic hydration had a sip or two of my own urine and it wasn t that bad, i ve got to tell you  the tim ferriss 2016 vintage was quite tolerable ''kevin rose  bottle it  you ve got to have a few fans out there that would pay for that  it was quite tolerable  but where were you going with that? so, yes, i did mention that  i d had a little bit too much caffeine earlier today and i was volunteering all sorts of information ''kevin rose  the only place i was going with that  and by the way, just so, people out there don t start drinking their piss every day, i m not recommending it, guys  i was just curious ''kevin rose  friggin  curious  that s funny  i can guarantee you i cannot think of a single legitimate doctor that i know who would recommend you drink your own urine ''kevin rose  that s right  so, kids, don t try that at home  yeah, don t try that at home ''kevin rose  i guess where i was going with that is just that being such odd ducks as you and i both are, it s got to make dating and finding that right person difficult  you probably have a different standard, they probably have a different  is that a hard match to find?''tim ferriss  you know the answer  it is  of course, it is  and i think also, i am not convinced at all, and i m actually quite convinced probably the opposite, that i need or want to date a long haired version of tim ferriss  i think that would be possibly a complete nightmare  it probably would be a complete nightmare  i m looking more for a complement than an overlap, if that makes sense ''kevin rose  that s fair  that s smart  i may be too hardcore  in my defense, i ve had some great relationships in the last decade  i ve had a lot of long term, very healthy relationships ''kevin rose  so, what about the work stuff? what don t you have figured out?''tim ferriss  thanks for the life raft  the work stuff, i will tell you i think i m not preoccupied by work  there are a lot of micro details that i haven t figured out, like slack versus facebook, or maybe i don t know exactly which of those  but that s window dressing  it s not material  it s a trivial, mundane thing that i ll think about because i find the technical aspects of it interesting ''but on a macro level, there are no looming, troublesome work questions that i m grappling with at the moment ''kevin rose  you seem to have found your life s work, then  in a sense, i feel like the podcast  it started out as a break from writing and a creative outlet, a way to minimize verbal ticks and improve my thinking, and learn to ask better questions  i recognized from the beginning that it was effectively my favorite part of the book writing process without the writing  being able to interview experts and hear their thinking, get a better understanding of their routines and what makes them tick, and non obvious solutions and all of that ''but also, to develop and improve my own thinking  i thought about it as my favorite part of book writing without the writing  but now it s its own thing, and the podcast itself is something i enjoy so, much ''it was never expected to go as long as it s gone  i m at 225, 250 episodes now  it s nuts, man  we did the first one ''kevin rose  yeah, i know we did  that was a drunken episode  that was a very drunken episode ''kevin rose  i remember when you came to me and you were like,  i m thinking about doing a podcast   i was like alright, you know, because i had done over 500 episodes of diggnation so, i was like okay, whatever  let s practice  let s have some wine  it turned out to be a shit show but it was fun  it was such a shit show  oh, man ''kevin rose  i m glad i was there  i feel very honored to have kicked it off with you so, that s awesome  yeah, it was fun  so, the work stuff, i would say the question i m asking myself, this year, 2017, i ve resolved to think a lot about absurdity and beauty as criteria for projects that i take on ''because neither of them lend themselves very well, and we could debate this but neither of them immediately lend themselves very cleanly to analytical quantification that i rely on so, heavily  does that make sense? i m good at that ''kevin rose  give me an example of absurdity and beauty  absurdity, i would say in simple terms is doing things just for the fuck of it that from the outside looking in, or maybe to anyone, don t seem to make any sense whatsoever ''kevin rose  urine  no, even that has a story ''kevin rose  that doesn t make any sense to anyone  but the narrative behind it kind of makes sense  like if you were to tell that story to anyone who really knows me, they d be like,  of course tim drank his fucking urine  big surprise  that guy s a lunatic   but i really want to have more fun playing with the so called rules out there, whether that takes the form of large scale pranks or misdirection, or just general weirdness ''kevin rose  to what end? what are you hoping to achieve?''tim ferriss  there is no hoping to achieve ''kevin rose  but i would imagine if you re going to do something absurd, you have to have a hypothesis around what you want to achieve out of that  i think it will stretch my mind in ways that i haven t stretched my mind before  in almost every culture, if you look at mythology and traditional ceremonies, there is a person designated, almost like a court jester to speak truth to power, to play in the realm of the absurd, to be the prankster  and in some cases, they will do exactly the opposite of what social convention is  so, if you re there in a very strict society, for instance, where people never eat with their mouths open, and i m just making this up ''but they might run around, say, eating rice and dropping it all over the place out of their mouths for this temporary period, like carnivale back in the day, where they re doing everything they re not allowed to do the rest of the year  they act as a boundary tester and a walker between worlds, in a sense  this is going to sound odd but i ve already admitted to drinking my own urine  i think there is a lot of power  i just sense there is a lot of latent potential empowerment in that space and we don t play enough in that space  i certainly don t  it s hyper logical, and i think there are certain limitations to that ''in that in lieu of trying to think bigger, think bigger, think bigger, which has a place  that thinking stranger and stranger and stranger will actually get me more of what i want or need, some of which i might not even realize i need  so, there s that  and you saw me earlier today in the car when i was on fire  i m a joker, and i haven t done a lot of that  i haven t really embraced that  that s a component of the absurdity piece ''and then beauty, and this is maybe tied into the absurdity, i recall very closely my podcast with b j  miller, one of my favorite podcasts i ve done  a hospice care physician, or palliative care physician who s helped more than a thousand people die ''kevin rose  i ve listened to his ted talk  it was wonderful  yeah, it s incredible  we spoke for two hours, whatever it was ''i asked him if he were bringing a patient in who was going to die in weeks or months and they weren t very social, if they weren t going to interact with other patients and, say, bake cookies, for instance, which is one of the most therapeutic activities that he mentioned for a host of reasons  and i should say also, at the same time that when someone is in hospice, the expectation of people who come into visit is sometimes they will be having these tuesdays with maury, wide ranging, philosophical, existential observations that are pregnant with meaning at every turn of phrase and that s just not what happens ''a lot of dying is just going through your day to day routine, like brushing your teeth, taking a shit, watching tv, and just waiting for the end to come  it s not all huge, philosophical breakthroughs  that s where the baking cookies comes in in part because it s on behalf of nothing but the tasting, and the smell, and the communal interplay of these different patients in their present state and present moment ''but i asked him if someone s not going to do that, not engage, what would you give them if you could give them three things? and he mentioned a comedy, he said plenty of space, plenty of time and space for just staring off and thinking  and then a book of mark rothko paintings  i asked him about the mark rothko paintings specifically and he explained mark rothko paintings are, in effect, extremely expensive painted squares ''like  80 million dollars for a huge painting that s two orange squares on a canvas  i asked him why? he said   and i m paraphrasing   in effect, he wanted people to consider and ponder how beautiful something potentially meaningless or pointless could be  the beauty in the meaninglessness ''and that conversely, when people are getting closer to death, they grapple with some of these very big questions that might not have very good answers  so, what happens after i die? why me? why now? these questions that are very stress inducing and can lead to a very difficult time and a very unpleasant time right up until death  so, instead, pondering the fact that maybe there is no answer to this, and maybe that s not a bad thing, and that you don t need all the answers ''you can experience beauty, you can observe beauty in the mundane, and in these fucking painted squares that sell for  80 million dollars  you can look at this and you can try to make sense of it and chances are you won t be able to make sense out of it but yet, at the same time, you can behold some sense of aesthetic beauty and absorb that  i thought about that a lot because i think humans are pattern recognition machines, and we look for answers and meaning and sense and logic in everything around us ''and sometimes that produces more pain than joy, i think  certainly, that s true for me  so, those would be i think a few of the reasons why i want to do more art projects, in a sense  and maybe this year isn t the year of big things for me  maybe it s the year of little things ''kevin rose  yeah, i m with you  i just recently took a woodworking class that was just one night a week for several weeks  woodworking was something that my father was really into before he passed away, and i never really got a good chance to  honestly, i was just too busy to really pay attention  dad is just always in your mind, he s always going to be around forever, and turns out that s not the case and the smell of sawdust to this day reminds me of my father ''i got back into that and it s been pretty awesome  actually, when i get back to new york a couple of days after we take off, i m going to be taking a traditional japanese woodworking class, as well  do you want to tell people about where we went this afternoon?''kevin rose  oh, man  we went and saw one of japan s living treasures  is it true? daria told me yeah, i m into woodworking, too ''kevin rose  him? no, i didn t say that  how would that even indicate that to him? i don t know why he would say that  we visited kawagita, mr  kawagita who is a national living treasure in japan ''kevin rose  in terms of woodworking, and i think there s one of seven total and he was the youngest to ever receive the national treasure at 59, and now he s 82  beautiful stuff  yeah, amazing ''kevin rose  we both got suckered in and bought a few of his pieces  i m so, happy about it ''kevin rose  yeah, so, am i  these pieces in some cases take five, ten years to make because they have to slowly whittle down a huge piece of wood to smaller and smaller forms, and at each step they have to effectively let the wood rest to dry, among other things, so, they can work with it effectively  i didn t know that about the sawdust  so, when you walked into that workshop, sawdust and shavings everywhere ''kevin rose  oh absolutely, it just reminds me of my dad, 100 percent  it s cool  i love doing stuff like that, though, in the same sense of kind of pushing yourself into uncomfortable situations  daria, my wife, thinks i m crazy because i try to find at least i would say three to five things per year that push me in new directions  for example, it was snowing in new york recently, and i like to walk around in birkenstocks in the snow, and my feet freeze ''i don t know why i do it but i like how it brings me to the present moment  it sounds crazy, but one of the things i really enjoy about meditation is i can calm the mind  this is also, one of those  don t try this at home, kids  ''kevin rose  yeah, i know  don t lose your toes ''kevin rose  it s not like i m out there for four hours  but i go out there and take my dog out for a walk, and i think people look at me a little strange  but it s just like you feel life  you feel that moment  i can feel it right there, you know? i think that s why i did wim hof s ice training  it s also, why i ve done extended fasting  things like that just really force you into kind of this very, very present moment which is awesome  and it s hard to get there  i m not going to act like i m some zenned out buddhist master because 99 9 percent of the time, i am not ''but you know what i m talking about  you go into meditation and most times, to be frank, meditation is just your mind jumping all over the place being monkey mind  nachos, nachos, nachos ''kevin rose  but every once in awhile, nachos nachos  quack ''kevin rose  i have never done the duck  but every once in awhile, it just turns into something beautiful and that s what i want more of  so, how are you thinking about producing that more for yourself this year?''kevin rose  gosh, this is the first year that i actually did away with new year s resolutions because i don t want to force myself into having to prove something  i m actually just going to take it month by month  i just turned 40  i feel pretty confident where i am in life, and i want to be more vulnerable  vulnerable to whom?''kevin rose  to everyone  to everyone  i feel like my entire life i have spent trying to build up to be something and constantly trying to find the next level  to level up  to look for  oh, if i could only make x number of dollars per year,   if only i could achieve this,   if only my startup could do this   it was always this trying to push the level up  one, i can t do it anymore because it s physically pulling me down and two, there s no happiness to be found there  i think you and i have been very fortunate in that we ve done some amazing things in terms of things that money can buy ''and i can tell you that that s not where it comes from  just because you are sleeping on a slightly better mattress, or have better walls, or a better front yard, or whatever it may be, happiness starts in the brain ''and until you can settle that and come to peace and come to terms with your brain, nothing physical is going to fill that void  it s something that people always say  i m not saying anything new, here  but i ve realized that  i watched that documentary, the minimalists  have you heard about those guys?''tim ferriss  yes ''kevin rose  i like their general message  i think the idea of just scaling back, and i ve sold a bunch of stuff on ebay  i hadn t used ebay in years and i just got rid of a bunch of shit and i m happier  i have less things to maintain, less garbage  i have a new rule  oh, gosh  this is my rule  i m one of those people who gets very wrapped up in the hot, new thing  meaning if someone s like  oh, you should try this supplement  and i know you re like this, tim, because you told me you have like 20 bottles of unopened supplements  well, we were talking about the 2 a m  amazon prime delivery, and we re like that s a fantastic idea  then you re like wait, why do i have three different chinese foot massagers? how did i get these? and you re like  oh, i see what happened ''kevin rose  right  it s easy to just want more things  so, my new rule is that if it s going to cost probably i d say more than  50 or  75, i wait 30 days  if in 30 days i still really, really want it and it makes sense in terms of my budget or whatever it may be, and my wife s not going to be pissed at me, then i can decide to buy it or not  so, how do you keep track? do you put it on the amazon wish list?''kevin rose  yes, i save it as a wish list if it s on amazon  otherwise, i put it in a reminders doc  reminders doc where?''kevin rose  there s a reminders app built into apple  and i will tell you that i have done this now for about three months, and i would say 80 to 90 percent of the shit i would have normally bought, i just don t buy anymore  it s awesome  it is awesome ''and i m less stressed  i have less crap  i ve done this with clothes  i just donated a ton of my clothes that i don t wear, and i probably have a quarter of the clothes that i used to  before we sat down, you said i have 300 tee shirts  no, i didn t say 300  i said i have too much shit  and i pulled out this shirt that i m wearing right now which i got for free, and which i love  it s very comfortable  but i was like, i probably have 60 tee shirts  that s fucking ridiculous, a  and b) i guarantee you anyone who s spent time around me could be like  oh yeah, there s the eight tee shirts that you wear  you don t even wear those other 40 ''kevin rose  oh yeah, i wear black tee shirts 99 percent of the time  i ve been fantasizing about going a little jobs ey and just getting a uniform, being like  okay, i m going to wear mizzen main chinos with a black tee shirt and van s slip ons and that s it ''kevin rose  that s hard on the dating life, though  my wife would be like  change it up a little bit, you know?''tim ferriss  yeah, i m okay  i wouldn t have anyone to veto my monotony ''there s no one who would care enough about that kind of thing to veto the monotony of my wardrobe  which, let s be honest, is not exactly gucci catwalk wear ''kevin rose  i ve got to say that s one of the things  we did this little thing at dinner that when i turned 40, i went around the table and talked about things that i really admired about everyone who was at the dinner  i don t know if i mentioned this about you, but that as you ve increased your popularity and wealth and everything else over the years, you still keep the same  you ve still got tee shirts and flip flops and cheap shoes and all kinds of shit  i love that, though  you just keep it real, which is kind of awesome  well, i worry about it, and we talked about this ''kevin rose  experience stretching  you call it experience stretching  i don t know why it s called experience stretching but hedonic adaptation, same thing ''which is the unfortunate phenomenon of adapting to new levels of comfort or quality in the things that you own so, that your new baseline, below which you become dissatisfied and unhappy, goes higher and higher and higher ''kevin rose  i ve got the best explanation ever, so, here you go  you start off, you have a wonderful trip planned to maui and you re like  gosh, i m going to the beach  this is going to be awesome  that s amazing  then you see a sunset  you re like  oh, beautiful sunset, that was great  i really enjoyed that  you go to bed  next day you wake up, another sunset  beautiful sunset  oh, guess what? i m going to have a glass of scotch with this  it s 12 year scotch  this is great ''next day, you wake up  oh, you know what would be great? that glass of scotch again but you know, if i added a cigar to this, and i ve got these cuban cigars my buddy got me  i m gonna have one of these  and you keep adding on and layering and experience stretching this entire time  and all of a sudden guess what?''that sunset, the original, beautiful, amazing gift that you had that first night is not so, special anymore because you don t have your scotch, you don t have your cigar, and you ve experienced stretched this whole thing and it s very difficult to go back from there  where did you get the term? i d never heard it before you brought it up ''kevin rose  oh, some book  i d have to go figure it out  it was some years ago  some book i read  so, this hedonic adaptation thing is something i think about a lot  you mentioned maui a few minutes ago  i was just in kawai a few weeks ago, with laird hamilton and gabby reese  laird hamilton, famed big wave surfer  everybody should see riding giants, the documentary  it will blow your mind  gabby reese s wife is equally impressive in a million ways, and a bunch of other folks like brian mckenzie and so, on for xpt training which was ice exposure, heat exposure, underwater weight training ''kevin rose  oh, i love that ''yeah, which is intense, and a number of other things  kelly starrett was also, there  all of these people have been on the podcast  the safe dosing of pain or discomfort, maybe, in those circumstances, and this is part of what appeals to me of the idea of a uniform, also  is getting say not fancy tee shirts but like hanes  just wearing something super basic, a few dollar tee shirt for a period of a few weeks would help to reinforce the fact that a) nobody really gives a shit  maybe one out of 100 people would even notice  and then second, that it doesn t matter  it doesn t materially impact in any other way my life  and in fact, it simplifies it a lot ''and by doing that, i will be less likely to feel compelled  i don t buy a lot of clothing anyway ''kevin rose  but you re hardy like that, dude  it doesn t have to be the same thing over and over again  you want a little variety for your spouse though, you know?''tim ferriss  yeah, i hear you but i m not quite there yet, a  but b) i do think that the fasting and these various practices, and if you really want to get nerdy, people listening, you can check it out  this is available on public domain  if you search for seneca on festivals and fasting, that is letter 13 in a collection of letters called the letters to lucilius  it talks about setting aside a certain number of days each month, or a week each quarter, to subsist on the cheapest of food, the coarsest of dress, etc  so, that you offset this hedonic adaptation which leads to some pretty miserable outcomes ''taken to an extreme, you and i both know and have spent time with people who have hundreds of millions of dollars, who are miserable cunts ''kevin rose  oh, for sure  i meant they re really unhappy people and they re like  oh, my day is ruined because my friend only brought me a  500 bottle of wine instead of  1000 bottle of wine  i can t even drink this ''kevin rose  yeah, it s just too bad  like that s disgusting  it s a terrible place to end up  and not that i m afraid of that, because i drink  4 00 wine from trader joes and i m perfectly happy most of the time  but i worry about that  it s something i worry about a lot ''kevin rose  i don t think you need to worry as much as most people, man  yeah, that s true ''kevin rose  you re pretty laid back  i don t have very expensive tastes, except when it comes to japanese lacquer wear, apparently ''kevin rose  and horse saddles  and horse saddles, yeah ''kevin rose  you go to tim s house and he s got crazy gold plated horse saddles and shit  i do have some weird stuff that i collect, also, from japan  oh, man ''kevin rose  this is fun  another wide ranging random show  anything else you would like to mention before we ''kevin rose  i ve got two things i ll mention  a little plug at the very end  my once a month newsletter  oh, two times  two times in one show ''kevin rose  well listen, it s a podcast, too  did i tell you i started my podcast back up again?''tim ferriss  are you?''kevin rose  yeah  really?''kevin rose  yeah  well, it s under the journal, now  but yeah  so, i have a newsletter called the journal  you can subscribe at thejournal email  it s once a month  it s a great newsletter ''kevin rose  it s a great newsletter  i ve got about 70,000 people on there that check it out so, i hope you join for that  it s also, a podcast  i just had some great guests on  i ve added elon musk and a bunch of other folks on there  i hope you ll give it a listen  you can just type in the journal, kevin rose into itunes and find it there  so, thank you, guys  i appreciate it  i ll give a couple more recommendations for people who want to explore  one is a sake recommendation ''kevin rose  oh, my god, this stuff is so, good  we went to the factory and gulped it down  i have to just mention this tour  so, the sake factory tour is on the itinerary  we show up, and this guy ended up being great but he s like,  oh, hey, you guys  alright, great  take off your shoes  come on in   this is all in japanese  so, we come in, and he kind of walks us quickly past a bunch of these tanks containing sake  he s like  alright, you got it? alright, good ''kevin rose  and look at the tank  it s bubbling  look at the tank bubbling  alright, great  that s the tour  and then he walks us into his tasting room ''kevin rose  no, wait  before that, one thing he did do was at the end of the tank  yes, this was the clincher ''kevin rose  this was the clincher  go ahead  so, he had a sipping ladle, in effect, is the best way to describe it ''he gave us some extremely fresh, unpasteurized sake which i ll be honest, folks  i m a japanophile, i spend a lot of time here  i ve had a lot of sake  most of it kind of tastes the same  i mean i know that s going to offend a lot of people but generally, most of it you re kind of like  okay, it s sake ''kevin rose  good sake  if it s terrible, it s terrible  but this stuff was fucking unbelievable ''kevin rose  i wanted to drink the whole ladle  everyone on this trip can consume a fair amount of alcohol  these are experienced drinkers  and everybody was astonished  then we go into the tasting room and we re expecting to sit down, and he ll be like  here, first we re going to have this  let me tell you about the notes and blah, blah, blah  but no, he sets out these glasses ''kevin rose  we each get one glass  ten bottles in a row, and he s like yeah, just get in a line like buffet style and go down and have a glass of each one ''kevin rose  he puts the alcohol pourers into the bottle at the top  did you notice that?''tim ferriss  oh yeah, like a bartender ''kevin rose  like a bartender, yes  so, we just went down the line and we just got hammed  yeah, basically every person was ham boned by the time they were done with a 45 second tasting of ten glasses of sake ''kevin rose  we were in and out in 45 minutes, hammered and then bought all the sake  oh, the most efficient sales job ever ''kevin rose  but  it s so, good  the sake is amazing  so, this one has the hilarious name of kiss of legend japanese sake  this is junmi digingo  junmi is pure sake, or unadulterated  it literally means pure rice  junmi, which i believe just means they haven t added separate alcohol into it, which you can taste for sure  and then digingo, which means i think 60 percent or so, of the rice husk, grain husk ''kevin rose  i think it s a little higher than that  maybe higher  has been removed  this should be reasonably easy to find  i m blanking on the producer name in my kungi are a little bit difficult to discern at this point in the evening  i would also, say, for those people looking for a book to read, i m reading right now   and i m going to blank on the author name but it is so, far fantastic, called genghis khan and the making of the modern world  it s spectacularly well researched and well written, and complements my favorite podcast series of episodes i ve ever listened to, which is hardcore history  that s dan carlin ''hardcore history, wrath of the khans  they re very, very complementary  if you re more of an audio person, you could either listen to wrath of the khans on hardcore history, or get an audio version of this book that i m reading right now  i m only about 5 percent into it but it s incredibly intelligently written and just a compelling and well researched account of this figure and the legacy that he left behind ''kevin rose  awesome  last thing i ll plug is a documentary called the birth of sake  i know we ve talked about this before  oh, yeah  fantastic ''kevin rose  all shot on really beautiful hd cameras  i guess everything is shot on hd cameras these days  shot on beautiful standard def ''kevin rose  beautiful standard vhs  no, but it really does cover the entire creation, kind of soup to nuts on creating sake and how much labor actually goes into the process  it was a really touching story so, check it out on netflix  okay, since you mentioned your newsletter, i think i ll mention mine as well  i m pretty sure you can get to this  it s five bullet friday  it s very popular  it s got lots and lots of folks, probably close to a million now who get this every friday  it s just a couple of recommendations, cool things i found like the sake or the book or other things that i ve come across ''you should be able to find it if you go to tim blog friday  it s free and you can check that out, birth of sake  fantastic  kevin rose,  speaking japanese , happy birthday ''kevin rose   speaking japanese  and we will talk to you guys soon  signing off  you ll be able to find links to all the things we mentioned, all the goodies at the usual show notes page  that s tim blog podcast  until next time, thank you guys for listening ''kevin rose  see you, guys '"
325,333,"Random Show — Fasting, Biohacking, and Tony Robbins (#333)","'kevin rose  don t sell us short, dude  come on  hold on, kevin  i haven t introduced you yet  but for those of you who enjoy the random, helter skelter (is that a right word?)  ''kevin rose  yeah, i think it is    nature   well, i m going to run with it, of the random show, which we haven t had an episode of for a very, very long time  it is a conversation between yours truly and my good friend, kevin rose ''kevin rose  guest no  1 on the tim ferriss show  that s true  you were guest no  1  the very first episode of the tim ferriss show ''kevin rose  actually, that s in my linkedin bio now  it s my claim to fame  it s in your google  bio ''kevin rose  that s right  we have not done a random show for a long time  but i ll let you do, if you want to do an introduction, of the random show ''kevin rose  i don t think we even need to anymore  i don t think we need to ''kevin rose  we don t even know what episode we re on  like, for those of you who have heard the random show before, i think we ve done probably, if i had to guess, i d say maybe 25 episodes?''tim ferriss  something like that   25 to 50 episodes ''kevin rose  so we re episode 27, let s call it  episode 27  kevin, for people who don t know you, what s your story? what would you like people to know about you?''kevin rose  that s a good question  what s the speaker bio version of kevin rose?''kevin rose  i don t even know these days  no, seriously, i would say that i ve been a long time internet entrepreneur  i probably am best known for creating the social news website digg back in 2004  that grew to become a pretty big entity for a number of years  then i was at google as an investor and now i m at true ventures as an investor  tim, you and i have probably co invested on maybe a dozen or so angel deals?''tim ferriss  yeah, at least ''kevin rose  facebook together  i think twitter together  twitter together, blue bottle coffee together ''kevin rose  yeah, a bunch of them  side note  do you remember how ridiculed we all were when the consortium of techies and non techies invested in blue bottle coffee? do you remember how much shit we got on the internet for that?''kevin rose  yeah, absolutely  they re like,  why would blue bottle need to raise money?  but it s done okay  it had a great exit here just about a month ago  it has done all right  it was, what, a majority stake acquisition by nestl  for  700 million or so  so, it worked out ''kevin rose  yeah, it worked out  so, you ve done very well as an investor  you are obsessed with many things japanese  you have a new obsession, it seems, every few weeks  do you have anything new to add? actually, i want to hear about the fast mimicking diet  because this is something   i would have put money on you never sticking with the fast mimicking diet and maybe you can explain for people what that means  but you ve actually now done a number of scheduled 5 day?''kevin rose  that s right  5 day fmd  i ll start by saying that probably the reason why, tim, you and i are friends   i met you when you were launching your first book on your boat party that you did  you rented out a warship in the san francisco bay  the s s  jeremiah, where they recorded a lot of the boiler room audio for the james cameron movie, titanic, in fact ''kevin rose  oh, crazy  that s awesome  but we hit it off because we both love all kinds of this idea of lifelong learning i think has been a theme that you and i both enjoy  i ve certainly got really into biohacking in the last couple years  i ve watched you from afar poke and prod yourself and squirt all different kinds of juices out of your elbow  this requires a little bit of explanation  this is so gross  but now i have to explain it  i had a botched prp injection, which is platelet rich plasma injection, in my right elbow  people can look up prp  it actually has some fantastic applications  but there was a botched injection, which pushed effectively subcutaneous bacteria into the elbow capsule itself and it turned into this horrible infection that required debridement and surgery and so on  but kevin, being the good friend that he is, came to visit me in the er when i was having   i m not sure you would call is synovial fluid   the infection fluid  ''kevin rose  it was the pus drained out of your elbow, basically  the pus drained out of my elbow with this gigantic syringe  being the mature adult that i am, i thought it would be funny to take this turkey baster worth of elbow fluid out of the sharps container and squirt it at kevin, who was in the room  i m not proud of it, but i don t regret it, either  so, yes, you ve seen me do a lot and make a lot of short term decisions that haven t turned out very well in the world of biohacking ''kevin rose  it s always entertaining though  got to say  had a lot of fun doing stupid shit together  but speaking of, well, probably not that dumb these days, but fasting  so, i got into fasting here probably about three years ago, two and a half to three years ago  i started fasting app zero, which is a free fasting tracker  that has really kind of blown up and taken off  but then i started hearing about the research from dr  valter longo  it actually was from a friend of mine, you know mike mazur, a mutual friend of ours  yup ''kevin rose  mike was diagnosed with stage iv cancer  he went into chemotherapy treatment and he was one of the guys that said, i m not going to just take what they give me, but i m going to go out and do my own research and see what else i can be doing to help fight this and beat this down  one of the things that came up was this idea of doing these 5 day fmds  fmd stays for fasting mimicking diet  the idea is that compliance of doing a standard 5 day fast is relatively low  it s am extremely difficult thing to do  tim, have you ever done a 5 day water only fast? have you tried?''tim ferriss  yeah, i ve done 5, 7, and 10 day ''kevin rose  i ve done a 5 day water only, and i will tell you, it is absolutely brutal  i don t know what your experience was, but i had a really difficult time sleeping  yeah, there s a, i believe it s a cholinergic effect that leads you have rapid heartbeat quite often, when you re trying to sleep  it s not pleasant  so, you ll be exhausted and you ll lay down in bed and you ll feel like you just ran a 100 meter sprint in terms of heartbeat  it s very unpleasant ''kevin rose  it s kind of scary  i m also one of those people that get those early heartbeats, where you feel like your heart skips a beat  they re completely benign  i ve had it looked at it and everything s fine, but i get those every once in a while and those come more frequently when i m in a fasted state  so, long story short, mike does this 5 day fast  he beats back cancer  he s in full remission, which is awesome  but the idea with the 5 day fast   can i interrupt you one more time? i think this, i don t think mike would mind this, but i remember you and i when we were talking about this   did he do 5 or 3? i can t recall ''kevin rose  i m sorry, you re right  he did 3  he did 3  just for those who are curious, i ve had conversations with dominic d agostino before on this podcast  he s a very well published researcher  i was first introduced to the possibility that fasting prior to chemotherapy, i believe, and reduction, it could be either, has the potential to increase the resilience of normal cells while increasing the susceptibility or weakness of cancer cells to facilitate this type of treatment, but also to decrease the side effect that are commonly experienced  so, mike, t my understanding, would do a 3 day fast before a session and while the other people in his cohort were laid out on the couch or in bed the next day, he d be running a 10 mile training run ''kevin rose  right, which is just insane  which is nuts ''kevin rose  yeah, and so he originally when he got turned on to this research by dr  longo, he showed me this youtube video where they were giving rats chemotherapy  the rats that were fasted were just running around the cage  they looked like normal, healthy rats  the ones that didn t fast were just, like you said, on their side, all beat up and in a horrible state  that s exactly what mike experienced  the idea is that making the chemotherapy more effective is that you re depriving the cancer cells of some nutrients, certainly sugar, less glucose, and it makes them more susceptible to the chemotherapy treatments, so the chemotherapy is that much more effective ''obviously, we can t say for certain whether that s what put him into remission, but he s really happy that it did work  he is in remission and the evidence looks pretty compelling in humans  they re also extending this whole protocol to healthy individuals as a way to potentially prevent cancer from even forming in the first place  i was turned onto dr  valter longo s new book, the longevity diet  i had him on my podcast  have you see this book yet?''tim ferriss  i have seen that  i haven t read it, but i have seen it ''kevin rose  it s pretty awesome  there s a whole chapter on his fmd protocol and what you need to do these 5 day fasts, getting into what it actually is  how it differs from a water only fast is that you do have calories  so, you have around 700 calories or so per day  some people say that sounds like a lot  some people say it sounds like a little  it s actually not much food  it s like a handful of small soup and some crackers  the first day, it s so not bad  you re like, oh, i can do this  like, some crackers and a little bit of soup  then day two and day three, and you re like, oh, my god, i m dying, right? but it s not nearly as bad as water only  but the idea is that you eat just enough good to still get into this fasted state ''so, all of your inflammation markers, all of the different markers that they re looking at in your blood, they look just like you re doing a water only fast, but with a minimal amount of food  so, you have a little bit of, not as much hunger, and a little bit more energy  and so the compliance is much higher  were you tracking   when you do these fmds, have you tracked your ketone levels at all? do you get into ketosis or does the small amount of carbohydrate and so on that you re consuming keep you out of ketosis?''kevin rose  i get a mild, i would say i get around  5 or so millimolars, so it s a very mild   that s right on the edge ''kevin rose  right, which is kind of brutal because you re kind of in the keto flu symptom area  so, you re not fully into ketosis  this is really interesting because peter attia, who you ve had on the show a few times, he s my doctor and i know you work with him as well  we played around with this protocol in that attia has put together an fmd diet that is a lot more ketogenic friendly  so, a lot heavier on the fats and a lot less on the refined carbohydrates  so, for example, when you re doing longo s version of this diet, and he actually has a nonprofit called prolon, so you d actually just order this kit  so, i get a kit in the mail that has all the pre packaged food  if you re watching the video version of this, this is what it looks like here  i just happen to have one  this is day 5  what does the nonprofit do with the money they get? because it looks very  ''kevin rose  it goes back into research  it goes back into research ''kevin rose  that s right  longo doesn t receive any of the money at all  he doesn t take a salary  this is meant for people that want to create a little autophagy, a little cell death, generate new stem cells, which he has proven actually happens via this 5 day method  the thing that hooked me though is i have had an elevated cholesterol on my whole father s side of the family  that s turned into heart disease with my dad and him passing away from a heart attack  my grandpa passed away from a heart attack  my grandma on my dad s side passed away from a heart attack  so, it s running deep  it s a little bit scary ''now that i m 40, i ve got these pretty bad numbers  so much so that attia has put me on crestor, which is knocking back the bad cholesterol with the statin, but obviously i d prefer not to be on a statin  anyway, long story short, because of his book, the longevity diet, i was reading through it and he said that he was seeing people that did the 5 day fast, they were improving their cholesterol numbers and they were getting more good cholesterol and less bad cholesterol  i was like, oh, that sounds interesting, i might as well give this a shot  but to give it a proper shot, you re supposed to do   and i talked to longo about this   but three back to back 5 day fasts over three months, and then once a quarter  so, there s like a loading phase of fasting, where you do whatever, the first week of each month for three months and then  ''kevin rose  it s the creatine of fasting  right, and then you do maintenance once a quarter thereafter ''kevin rose  that s right  okay ''kevin rose  yeah, so i did the first 5 day fast three months ago  i had my bloodwork drawn pre and post  small minor improvements  second fast, same thing  then by the third, we actually saw a dramatic drop on a few different fronts cholesterol wise  attia, when he called me up, because we do these little calls to go over my bloodwork, he was like,  kevin, you re going to live to 90 if you can keep this up  this is amazing   he was shocked  he was blown away  we re pretty happy with the results  we ll see how long they stick  this is no dietary changes  granted, there s a dietary change during those five days, but no long term  i m still kind of sticking to the same diet that i ve always been sticking to  i like that he was so specific with 90  that s lower than i would ve expected, so it must be all the meth that you re doing that s going to kill you ''kevin rose  yeah, i still do a dose of meth every now and then  actually, speaking of meth, dude, i just did some l theanine for the first time today  have you tried this with coffee?''tim ferriss  it is very interesting stuff, to be sure ''kevin rose  oh, my god, dude  i d never tried it before  i took a pill, 200 milligrams this morning, and i was out with a mutual friend, tony conrad  we met for coffee and i gave him a pill too  we were like cracked out for like three hours, man  yeah, so this observing of the biohacking is a mutual arrangement that kevin and i have  it s not just him watching squirting fluid out of my elbow  i also observe things that you do  on the fmd though, just to return to that for a second, you mentioned in passing that attia had looked at the possibility of doing a lower carbohydrate, higher fat version ''kevin rose  he actually has a protocol for that, yeah  i m sure he d give you the pdf if you ask for it for the podcast notes  have you tried it?''kevin rose  i did  i did that for the second one  i liked it, actually i just happened to buy a 3 pack of the prolon kit, so i wanted to go through them and use because they re not cheap and so i just used that for the last one  but i like attia s in that it s a little bit more work, obviously, because you re preparing your own food, but his is different in that with prolon you get these little, tiny snacks throughout the entire day  with his, it s one meal a day and it s just a salad  it s greens and three tablespoons or four tablespoons of olive oil and like six olives and some sunflower seeds  it s not a whole lot, but it certainly gives you   but it s not as refined  so, i saw my ketone levels go up on his  i certainly had more energy on his versus the prolon  got it  i ll ping peter about that  it makes sense on multiple levels that you would have higher ketone levels  for people who are wondering how one would measure ketone levels, i think you and i still use the same device, which is the precision xtra by abbott labs, which does a sufficient job in measuring something called bhb, beta hydroxybutyrate in the blood ''for a number of different reasons, this is a much more precise and accurate, let s just call is precise, but consistently precise   maybe it s accurate, maybe it isn t   method of measuring ketones or the degree to which you re in ketosis than pee sticks  because as your body becomes, or if you re already very efficient at using ketone bodies, you could show a false negative  where you pee on the stick and it tells you you re not in ketosis, when in fact you are  so, the blood is just more accurate  i m glad you re going to live 90  that makes me happy ''kevin rose  yeah, it was a pretty cool experiment and certainly for someone who has heart disease running in their family, i m going to keep it up  i m going to do another blood draw here next week to see where my levels are at and then i m trying to do this quarterly  hopefully, if we can get it down to where i won t be using statins any longer, that d be great  the last time we did a random show, it was a very, very long time ago, i believe  i was at least before you had a little monkey in your house  a reason, many reasons, of course, to stick around, but now a very compelling new reason  so, how would you describe   since certainly i have no kids that i m aware of at this point  ''kevin rose  that s a good disclaimer there  i don t have kids    that i know of  what have been the biggest changes that you ve felt or observed in yourself or otherwise? how you view the world? anything like that now that you have a kid? and what is your kid s name?''kevin rose  zelda  she s four months old  she s named after the video game because one of the first things that my wife and i bonded on very early in our relationship was our love for the game zelda  actually, the new zelda game allows you to track your hours played  it actually shows it in the little settings menu  darya has over 200 hours played of the latest zelda  she s hardcore  she played a lot during her pregnancy  she s a true believer  and when we were in japan a long time ago, darya was using some time of emulator, i don t know what device it was on exactly, but she was playing zelda on all the trains when we were sitting down and chilling  that s one thing i remember ''kevin rose  the original  yeah, josh cook was too  that s right ''kevin rose  it s fun to play the original ones with those old school emulators  but yeah, in terms of her, it s hard for, i think, a guy in that when you have your first child, there s not a whole lot to do  there s just a lot of crying  i tried to help out where i can but rly she was on her mom s hip for the first several weeks and there s a lot of getting used to new things  now, it s just amazing, dude  you walk into a room and she lights up when she sees me for the first time  she smiles and giggles  it kind of changes the way that i want to approach life in terms of what things are important and trying to make more time to be a good father ''for someone like myself that has so many varying interests and certainly can get sucked into new things pretty easily, i ve been trying to be a little bit more thoughtful about where and when i spend my energy so that i can kind of dial back  i ve spent a good portion of this year trying to live a little bit more of a minimalist lifestyle  what are some of the steps that you ve taken to do that? i feel like you and i have had this conversation every year since we first met  but now, you actually have a gigantic incentive to follow through ''kevin rose  well, it s funny  every time tim and i get together, it s like oh, man  i ve got too many investments  i m doing this  there s too many things going on  i ve got to spend my time here  we re always more or less complaining to each other of us taking on too many things  it s so ridiculous  so, i ve just been trying to implement a few rules  one of the things i did starting january 1st was to throw away or donate something every single day  so, i have forced myself to go in and   for example, i went in and i just picked out all the clothes that i haven t touched in a year and i took them down the street, like half a block away is a donation place, and i donated anything that i hadn t worn in a year  it really thins out your closet  was that easy for you to do?''kevin rose  yes, absolutely  it was? there was no resistance? you weren t like,  but that s the sweater that my auntie janie gave me  ''kevin rose  who s the lady you had on your podcast that wrote that book?''tim ferriss  marie kondo  technically, marie kondo is how they would say it in japanese, but marie kondo ''kevin rose  marie kondo  yeah, she s awesome  i listed to her audiobook and one of the things that she says in her audiobook is that  the way that you can depart with something is to realize that it has already taught you its lesson  that lesson may be that it wasn t for you   if you have it hanging in your closet and you look at it and you re like,  oh, but someday i might    no, the lesson is that it spent its time with you, it wasn t for you, and it should go to  good home where it can be appreciated by someone else  my lesson is not to buy it again  i took that and i ve applied that to thinning out pretty much everything in my life ''i think a lot of people, there s this analysis paralysis thing where you think about cleaning out the garage or you re thinking about doing this massive overhaul in your life and you re like, it s the weekend, i ve got to do this  there s always something that jumps in front of it in terms of priorities  for me, i find that if i just say, okay, one thing a day  at the end of year, i may not be to my goal, but after five years, i certainly will  it s not like i have that much stuff  but really saying, do i need this in my life? is it bringing joy to my life? it s such a good forcing function to get rid of a lot of stuff  everything you get rid of is actually less of a mental load on you ''there was this old tea master that i met one time  tim and i have done some crazy travels all throughout china in tea lands  oh, the stories we could tell ''kevin rose  seriously  we ve done some crazy stuff in the middle of the yunnan province  nothing sexual  that was our friend  we had a friend that did something  so, long story short, the one thing that this tea master showed me was he pulled out of his pocket one key  he showed me the one key  he goes,  kevin, do you know what this is?  i was like,  it s a key   he s like,  yeah, it s the key to my house  this is my one key  i ve worked my entire life to have one key   because we can all have multiple keys  meaning the things that you purchase  whether you have a key to your boat or your spare garage or a motorcycle or whatever it may be ''there s things in your life that you accumulate and the least amount of burden and the most happiness you can get is having less stuff to worry about  and so i find that to be really true  that s what i ve been trying to focus on is having less and being happy with a handful of high quality things  i also want to mention that it s possible to read a book like marie kondo s book, which i can never remember the title of it  i want to say the magic art of japanese tidying up, but no, it s something close  it s like the art of, the joy of magic cleaning up  i can never remember the exact phrasing  i don t know why  but in any case, that cult following with her book leads some readers to think it s an all or nothing, take it or leave it approach  you, on the other hand, have philosophically found bits and pieces of that book that are very useful to you but are tactically doing the opposite of what she recommends, but it works for you ''so, she recommends doing this once in a lifetime tidying super bowl, basically, where you block out two or three days of your life and that s what you do and then the rest is maintenance  it s kind of like the fast mimicking diet of japanese tidying  you have this loading phase  i ve had this book   i actually am looking at it on my bookshelf right now   for like two years  i m just like,  man, i m going to do it  i m going to do it   then i m like, two to three days? i look at my calendar and i m like,  no, i m not going to do it  i m just not going to do it   i like the idea tactically of one at a time  one per day ''also, what s helped me, because i have actually been, since i moved to austin not too long ago, it s been a great opportunity after boxing everything up  okay, do i really want to box all this stuff or do i just want to donate a lot of this because it might be from a 1 to 10 scale of value a 2 to me, or maybe a 1, maybe a 3  but i could donate this very to goodwill or somewhere else to say a high school gym that needs equipment, which is something i ve done in the past, and it s an immediate 8, 9, or 10  it s a nice karmic chess move to donate  you think of not what you re losing, but also what you re giving to someone else in that respect, which i find really helpful  so you re giving away one item per day ''kevin rose  the other thing, too, i will tell you along those lines is that if there is a purchase that i want to make that is not just what i would consider to be a necessity like toilet paper or whatever it may be, and it s something that is luxury, not luxury but in the sense of it s going to cost you over  100, and i don t necessarily need it, but i kind of want to try it, what i do is i save for later on amazon  so you can add and say save for later  set a reminder in your calendar app for a week or two weeks later  almost 90 percent of the time i end up not buying that thing  i still have one thing in there actually from you  it s that nac supplement  should i buy that? i haven t bought it yet?''tim ferriss  well, nac, i should say with all of this stuff that we re discussing because it bears repeating  we are not doctors  we don t play them on the internet  everybody should assume that at least 50 percent of what we re saying is complete fucking nonsense and we are just not sure which 50 percent it is  so, work with a qualified professional before you start taking or stopping any type of medication or supplement  the nac came to me initially because i was looking at it as a means to accelerate recovery between workouts  my understanding   i might be getting this wrong   but is that it is a precursor to glutathione, which some people think of as this master antioxidant or upstream antioxidant that a host of beneficial effects ''what i noticed in taking the nac is that i was over the period of a week to 10 days, perhaps seven, eight days into it, that i was more even keeled than was typical  like the week had been very smooth  i hadn t change anything else that i could identify  i d been either meditating or not meditating for a series of weeks  there were a lot of constants  when i went onto pubmed and began to look at n acetyl cysteine and search for other terms, like  depression  or  bipolar,  and so on, there were a number of search results that popped up that seemed to indicate to me that there was some promise in using nac to mitigate the amplitude of the ups and downs that could be associated with bipolar ''that s the primary reason that, for period of time, and i cycle off of all of these things  i became very fascinated by nac, which quite nicely does have potentially recovery benefits from an athletic standpoint, although most of my athletic prowess has been focused on eating oatmeal cookies recently, so i can t really claim that i m doing a lot of killer workouts  i got rhabdo from eating oatmeal cookies  for you crossfitters out there, that s for you  the other would be something you and i are both familiar with, which is low dose lithium orotate, very, very low dose lithium orotate, 5 mgs, which you can find on amazon and elsewhere ''there s a great new york times article which people can find very easily that is titled along the lines of  maybe we all just need a little bit of lithium   it talks about the inverse correlation of groundwater concentrations of lithium with, i want to say at least reported, suicide, homicide, manic depression, and so on  those two, for me, function in tandem or at least appeal to me for very similar reasons  so, the nac, should you use it or not, i think is a question of whether you feel you need it  for me, at least currently, i get asked all the time, what are your top 10 supplements that you re using right now? because people have this impression after reading the 4 hour body and so on that i walk around with a drip iv bag in my arm and have a thousand pills i m taking four times a day ''kevin rose  well, i ve certainly seen you in that mode  you have seen me in that mode, but my mode right now is to really ensure that i am using supplements as supplements  that i m not using them to absolve me of the responsibility to eat proper food, for instance  it s like look, if you re drinking a lot and you re like compulsively watching porn and not exercising and mainlining pixie sticks for your diet and you re like,  wow, i m depressed  maybe i should take 15 different supplements   it s like no, you need to fucking fix the rest of your life and then see what your baseline is because you re creating so much static and noise and garbage inputs that you don t even know what your baseline is  it s so disguised with sort of the trauma and confusion of your inputs ''kevin rose  do you track your baseline? do you log what you consume and what you take?''tim ferriss  this is going to sound so primitive and it is, but my baseline is really how do i feel when i wake up? do i want to stay in bed because i don t want to face the day? am i anxious? are those my first thoughts coming out of bed? assuming that i m not checking my phone, right? because it s really my starting state out of the gate of sleep to wakefulness  then at night, how much trouble do i have sleeping? if any  or do i fall asleep easily? how deep is my sleep? so for deepness of sleep, you could certainly use something like an aura ring or an accelerometer  there are different means by which you could try to assess the quality of your sleep ''but for me, really looking at how consistently i feel good waking up and how long it takes me to get up to say first or second gear  it historically has taken me a long time to go from park to second or third gear  some people wake up   you might be one of these people   they re like,  fuck it, world! here i am! i m ready to party!  that s not me  i have a real slow build ''kevin rose  i think in between you and that  i m definitely not ready to party the second i wake up  i am after coffee  i have a cup of coffee, i m ready to party  i feel that way, if, for instance, i m in ketosis, past about 2 millimolars  i need less sleep  so, let s call it six versus eight hours  and when i take up, i am awake  versus feeling groggy for an hour or two, hour and a half  which can be remedied somewhat by the psychological advantage of exercising in the morning, which is one thing i ve been scheduling to do more of per jocko willink, a retired navy seal commander and all around intense dude ''kevin rose  badass  yeah  intense, accomplished guy  people can find him at tim blog jocko  jocko s first ever public interview  i m thrilled to have unleashed the giant, white gorilla on the internet  baseline though, to return to your question, is really something i try to keep as simple as possible  do i and have i measured all of those other things? yes  but i think that whether it s with your body or with a business, or any number of other things, it s really easy to become addicted to measuring things that don t matter very much  or worse still, measuring things that will distract you from the things that do matter  does that make sense?''kevin rose  yeah, that totally makes sense  i ve tried to pare it down to just the stuff i really care about  i just sent you a link in our video chat to my dashboard for the things i measure every day  so, for me, i m really concerned about my glucose levels because they are a tiny bit elevated  so, i do waking glucose, bedtime glucose  i do whether i meditated that day or not  i do how many hours i fasted the night prior  i do how many drinks i ve had and then i do what type of workout, whether i had tea or coffee that day, and then my food  but food not in terms of a by the calorie, super anal kind of breakdown, but really just typing out what i ate for that day as a way to hold myself accountable and just look over the last few days at a glance and see if i ve been behaving or not  so, i find that just the act of writing it down makes me behave a little bit better  it does  okay, that was going to be my question  how does that actually impact your behavior?''kevin rose  this is a fascinating question  i did an experiment here about three weeks ago with a group of five friends  i created this spreadsheet that we all logged into every single day  what you do is you record the number of drinks you had the night before  i was thinking about turning this into an app, although i m not going to do it  but i was interested in trying to create social pressure to drink less  not to drink more, but to drink less  the thing that i found that was really interesting is that if you drink over two drinks in a night, people have some shame in reporting that, so they will mis report  if you went out and you had four, five drinks, it s like,  i don t want to be the guy who had four drinks   the one asshole on the spreadsheet ''kevin rose  right, exactly  so, i changed it then so the spreadsheet would only say 2   so that s the max you could go  then people were more open to being like,  yeah, i had 2  last night   they were a lot more at ease, but it still created a little bit of social pressure and personal pressure if you looked at your list and you re like,  ooh, there s been four nights of 2  there  i should probably do a night without drinking   so, my idea was to create an app that would allow you just to say up to 2  and see all of your friends in the same arena and then hopefully encourage you to be able to drink socially but not take it too far  yeah, this brings up all sorts of really fascinating and frustrated methodological questions in terms of designing this type of reporting, right? because i was thinking to myself as you were saying this, well, if you had a larger group, say a group of 200 people, one would expect you would have more people in that group reporting drinking 2, 3, 4 drinks on any given night  so, the shame factor would be decreased, but if you decrease the shame factor, that also decreases the incentive to actually behave, right? because you can blend into this perceived acceptability of being like well, there are 10 other people out of 200 who had four drinks last night  that s totally fine ''kevin rose  well, the question is, how well do you know the people? so, how tight are they in your social connections in your peer group? like brenden mulligan   i ll call him out because he s a friend of ours  he works at google  he never drinks  he has like one drink  one drink  one drink every four days or whatever  seeing him hit those streaks of like zero drinks, zero drinks, that was also a pretty powerful thing  i m saying i need to be more like brenden  i need to dial it back  so, it goes both ways  that s true  i suppose if you re seeing friends of yours doing well who have demanding jobs, demanding relationships, you can t use that as your excuse when you have the data right in front of you showing that they re actually behaving  so, you historically have been a non trivial drinker, let s call it  like a minor league all star of booze consumption ''kevin rose  i used to drink a lot more, to be honest  you can see my spreadsheet here  so, what has helped you most to decrease the amount that you drink?''kevin rose  well, i think there is fear  i ve seen a bunch of studies, there was one that was just published here a couple weeks ago, the largest study ever around dementia and alcohol abuse  they ve very closely linked, which is really frightening  i think wanting to live longer for my daughter is another one, back to the point you had earlier about what has changed  and just getting older  hangovers happen at 2 5 drinks these days  why roll the dice? for me, to get to your question around what have i done differently, there s a couple things  one, i ve set aside time to learn at night, which i think is really important  you really can t drink and learn at the same time  or remember what you attempt to learn ''kevin rose  exactly  the second thing that has been huge for me though has been the sauna  the sauna has been massive because it is like four drinks or three drinks, just by going and doing a 30 minute, high intense heat sauna session  you come home and you sleep like a baby  if you don t have a sauna, that can also be substituted with a really hot bath  it s always been about i m with my wife, i m sitting down, and we re going to crack open a bottle of wine, and i ll have a couple glasses of wine  it s never been like,  hey, let s go party!  those days are long gone  like a decade plus gone  no, don t look at me like that!''tim ferriss  a decade plus?''kevin rose  listen, if we re out traveling together, tim, we re going to have fun, right?''tim ferriss  okay ''kevin rose  so, the only times you and i hang is when we re traveling together, so you can t put that on me  all right, fair enough  we re in different cities now  i will say, for those people who are like, wait   they can see each other? we are doing a very intimate video chat on skype that you will be able to see on my youtube channel, youtube com timferriss  kevin is dressed for success, i will note ''kevin rose  i just had a park meeting this morning, so we dress up a little bit  i appreciate it  so, i gave you that look  traveling is a bit of an exception  how do you prevent yourself   you have traveled a lot  in some cases, historically  now, that may change with your daughter, but how do you prevent that from becoming the excuse to drink that happens frequently? does that make sense? because this happens in all sorts of capacities, right? where people will say,  oh, you re traveling, you should eat pizza every night   i hear that and i m like if i followed that role, i d be jabba the hut, because i end up traveling so much  if i allowed myself that out, it would become a real problem ''kevin rose  yeah, traveling is difficult, especially when it s in a social setting  if you combine traveling with social  i ll be going to ted in a couple weeks and i know that there s just going to be a lot of parties and a lot of events and a lot of drinking  i think that s one of the things that i need to work on is that i have a hard time dealing with large groups of people that i don t know  as a social lubricant, alcohol is amazing, right? it s like, what else can we do? i think that someone was telling me that you never really strengthen that muscle if you re leaning on the crutch of alcohol  so, you re never going to become more comfortable with new humans and new interactions and new ways of breaking the ice if you always just go to the booze, right?''so, i think of it like, this is my workout that i m going into  i ve got a couple little hacks  one is to show up a little bit late, so then you skip a drink, right? it s funny how if you skip a drink or two and you get there and people are already a little hammered, how unattractive and unappealing drinking then becomes  because you look at everyone s like,  hey, good to see you!  and it s a little bit sloppy  you look at that and you re like, okay, they re relaxed  they re not going to remember what i said anyway, not that they re that hammered, but you know what i mean  they re in their relaxed state  so, i can be a little bit more jokey and be myself and not have to worry about being hammered  that s a big piece of it ''when i m at home, you re going to laugh at this, but on amazon, i bought these   speaking of buying more things that i m probably going to throw away in a year   i bought these measuring cups that measure out exactly one glass of wine  so, what i do there is a bottle of wine we all know is kind of, like a half bottle of wine is kind of two and a half, maybe, it s up there  it s very easy, like darya will have a little bit less than me and i ll say, okay, i ll wait until it gets halfway and then i ll stop, you know? but you re actually drinking more than you think  yeah, plus with a wine glass, if you have a large wine glass, you can think like a third of a bottle or close to half a bottle very easily ''kevin rose  right, exactly  so, what i do now is i bought this measuring glass off of amazon  i fill that perfectly, pour it in, get my second glass, fill it perfectly and pour it in  so, that s all of my alcohol for the night  it stops me at two drinks, and i really take my time with it then  i have dinner  i slowly sip it  i look at it  i go sit down  we might watch a little john oliver or something and then continue to sip on it  that s my way of locking in  i know no more past that  it prevents any hangovers  my doctor says it s pretty good for you to have a glass or two a night  then also   dude, don t laugh at me! it is good for you! ish  i ll go with ish ''kevin rose  no, but then it s also taking nights off altogether  i think that s the other big piece of it  yeah, for sure  good for you, man  i love it  now, you mentioned one other thing  well, actually a couple of other points because i ve been also cutting back on alcohol quite a bit  i still enjoy alcohol  not gonna lie  i do have booze on occasion ''kevin rose  i love your drunk   oh, the drunk dials?''kevin rose  yeah  those are fun  for those who don t know, occasionally, i do these drunk dial episodes  it s the laziest podcast format thought up, i think to date, perhaps, which is i have listeners fill out a google form with their contact info and i set a time, like a two hour window where i will call people via skype and starting drinking at call 1 and drink all the way through to say call 10 and get progressively more inebriated as i answer questions  that is fun  i did one about a week ago  it was a good time  then i thought i should do another episode today  i was like, i just don t want to do two nights of sipping tequila on skype  a few things that have also helped me  no  1 is, and this is not an excuse everyone is going to be comfortable using, but if i go to a party and they re like,  hey, man  you re not drinking? what the fuck?  i ll be like,  yeah, i m on a bunch of weird drugs  i am not really supposed to drink alcohol right now  ''kevin rose  oh, that stops the conversation right there  that s brilliant  yeah, well it stops the push  but then it also starts another conversation like,  well, what kind of weird shit are you on?  at any given point, i think it s fair to say that i could answer in the affirmative to  are you on any weird shit?  i m almost always doing something odd  it might not be a lot of stuff, but i m probably trying something new  that stops people cold  if they re like, oh, wow  i mean, it could be tylenol  if you re taking acetaminophen in any capacity, people may not realize this, but some absurd percentage of emergency room visits and liver failures are associated with high dose acetaminophen, which is not that much  it s something like two or three times the label allowable amount over 24 hours  it s really a potent and potentially dangerous drug  so, that s one   i m actually on this    i m on a, b, or c,  or  i m on a bunch of weird stuff at the moment and i m just not supposed to drink   it works really well ''then second, and this is actually advice that richard branson gave on this podcast is, having club soda with a dash of cranberry juice or something like that  just using that as your default go to  one thing that i do which is going to sound really odd and it is odd, but i have a superstition about  cheers ing,  clinking glasses, when i don t have any alcohol in my glass ''kevin rose  interesting  this is your tell  this is something that well, it s kind of a tell  but what i ll do is i will sometimes also go up to the bar and i ll say, just give me a tiny splash, like the equivalent amount that would be in a thimble or something like that and then i ll cut myself off at that  that s the amount that allow myself  that s another approach that i take to cut back on the booze  you mentioned though that you ve been trying to learn at night and that the booze is not conducive to learning at night  what are you trying to learn at night? what types of things? what s the format? are you reading 100 pages a night or what is it?''kevin rose  honestly, have you heard of this coursera course called  learning how to learn ?''tim ferriss  i have not  who teaches it?''kevin rose  it s done by a couple professors  i m actually in the middle of that right now  another kind of biohacker recommended it to me  apparently, it s the no  1 watched course on coursera right now  it s just been fascinating how they dig into the science of learning and how you go on this kind of focused or diffused mode and how to really go in and concentrate on something and when the optimal time is to learn  it s all the science around learning  i m just getting started with it  that s what i ve been diving into and spending my nights watching those videos  but it talks about the importance of actually getting away from your material  so, getting really focused and setting a timer for 25 minutes maximum  going really in depth on the course material and then backing away and going into this more relaxed mode ''they were talking about, who was it? benjamin franklin? i can t remember who it was that used to hold a pair of keys in their hand  salvador dal  did this as well, actually  hold a pair of keys in your hand and you kind of just go into this relaxed state thinking about what you want to learn, to where you almost fall asleep and when you drop the keys out of your hand and it wakes you up, that s when you go back and then you realize you were successful getting that relaxed  you ll retain and become more creative  i don t know  it s just fascinating stuff  i m just getting started with the course  and it s free  very cool  yeah, the intervals and the duration of intervals for learning, along with break periods, is something that i ve experimented a lot with as it relates to language learning  because it s so measurable, you can look at, say your recall of foreign vocabulary, assuming you re controlling for a few different variables, right? adjectives are generally going to be harder than nouns, for instance  but if you re controlling for that, you can look at what your retention is, say 48 hours later, for 100 words you attempted to learn in one session versus two sessions versus three sessions with different types of breaks  i did that when i was looking at a few different languages, specifically in 2004, 2005  actually, i ve never shown you these notes ''i have text edit documents with all of my notes on language learning for about a year long period, looking at all this type of stuff  there were some very clear patterns, such as focusing on the material right before bed with no interruption  much like how it s recommended by many names both you and i know, that you meditate first thing in the morning before you brush your teeth, before you check your phone, before anything else  when you have this tabula rasa blank state of sorts  focusing on material that you want to consolidate in memory and recall later right before bed, at least in my experience, dramatically improves recall  then, this is actually very important, not just doing that, but when you wake up, before doing anything else, which for me would override meditation, doing a recall exercise of some type  i tend to use flashcards, to determine which have stuck and which have not ''so those that have not, since i m looking at language, i would give myself like a quarter of a second  it couldn t be delayed because in speech, you re not going to have the luxury of sitting there paused for long periods of time  it would go back into the rotation for review again throughout that day and later that night  but that has proven really, really helpful ''kevin rose  how about exercise? one of the things they mention in this course is this idea of doing cardiovascular exercise  i believe it s post learning something new  apparently, this science was saying that it just sticks that much more  i don t have any numbers in front of me, but it was something along those lines  have you heard anything about that?''tim ferriss  in terms of the timing of exercise, i have less clarity, but there s an entire book called spark that talks about, among other things, the role of exercise in education and learning, and would point to things like bdnf, the release of brain drive neurotrophic factor, which can be elicited through different types of exercise  part of me thinks that when one says because these are the easiest to study, or very often the easiest to study, cardiovascular exercise, this is where it comes down to trying to become literate with reading scientific studies or understanding how things typically work  as a couple of baselines, scientific studies usually use volunteer populations known as students  those students have 45 minute class blocks or 60 minute class blocks ''so, to keep those students busy, people are very often disincentivized from using shorter duration, high intensity training or something like that  weightlifting, for instance  resistance training  if you want to, as an experimenter, design something that requires as little monitoring as possible, it s like, all right, stick them on a stationary bike  if you have people doing burpees or deadlifts, like you actually need to  ''kevin rose  i hate burpees  yeah, but you actually need to pay attention, right? you need to pay attention if people are lifting weights and so on  there are more safety concerns  so, just to point out perhaps the obvious, weightlifting is actually one of the most cardiovascular activities you could possibly engage in, but i won t digress into that  you can look at a book called body by science for all of the details and why that is the case  but it would make sense to me that exercise could certainly play a role in increasing cognitive function ''but one of the questions that i ask myself all the time, when, and this is a good question for people to ask themselves when they see a headline that makes a scientific claim, is what else could explain this? what else might explain this? if you re looking at cardiovascular exercise right after some type of cramming with material, you could make the argument that perhaps it s not the exercise at all, it s the fact that they re going into a semi mindless or meditative, repetitive period where they re able to, their subconscious somehow work on the material, right?''kevin rose  right  well, this exactly what this course teaches is how to get into those periods  yeah, 100 percent  i have certainly seemed to observe that exercise in some capacity, for me, it s generally some type of resistance training, does have a positive effect on learning  so, yet another reason to get off your ass, which is something i need to do more of  i ve digressed  i ve fallen off the train a little bit, kevin rose  i ll be honest  but i shall get back on the train  fortunately, once you have a recipe that works, you have the confidence that you can get back on  that s the good news, right? say with the fast mimicking diet, not that you should use that for body composition, but fast mimicking diet or intermittent fasting, which a lot of people use your app zero for, for slow carb diet, plus a handful of things like kettle ball swings ''i just know this is why i m not stressed out about being off the rails  i kind of make fun of myself about it  because it s like look, if i just follow the prescription, like follow the algorithm for three to four weeks, there s no magic involved  it will work and i will have less muffin top to grab when i m in the sauna, which will make me happy ''kevin rose  muffin top in the sauna is the worst  you look down and you see that little layer, this little boop  you also have like the glistening cinnabon effect because you re sweating  it s a really unattractive look  it s not a good look ''kevin rose  it s not good  one thing i did want to talk about, which i think would be fun to chat about because we ve both done is, real quick, is tony robbins  yeah, let s talk about it  for sure  so, i ve done two different tony robbins events  upw, unleash the power within, which was my first event  then, more recently in december of this last year, date with destiny, which is a longer event ''kevin rose  oh, you did that? i didn t know you did date with destiny as well  i did  so, i ve done two events  some people have had a bit of exposure to date with destiny through the i am not your guru documentary, which was co produced, in fact, by someone who s been on this podcast, brian koppelman, a really accomplished filmmaker  but what was your experience like? your first tony robbins event?''kevin rose  it was kind of crazy  thanks to you, i got hooked up with him  i went down and got a chance to meet him and hang out with him  i think that tony has proven himself now that he s been doing this for so long  he s been doing it for 40  years  but i think that in the back of my mind, i remember when i was a little kid, the audiotape version, infomercial version of tony  so, there was always this stigma in my mind that was like, is he trying to sell me something? what s going on here? i also watched his documentary and i was like, wow, this guy is clearly brilliant  he takes this stuff very seriously and he s truly breaking through to people and helping people change their lives ''he was like,  i m going to be in the bay area, you should come down   i was like,  okay, that sounds awesome   i took a buddy of mine that has a lot of anxiety  he shall go unnamed but he wanted to go  he was like,  kevin, let s do this   i was like,  okay, let s do it   so, we went down for the three day event  i thought it was great  i ve got to tell you  you walk into it   and i was in arena where there was 12,000 people  there are a lot of people there  everybody is coming there for a different reason, right? i was sitting across from a guy that had lost his legs and was previously a drug addict  i think he had some infection in his legs or something and had to have them both amputated  i was sitting next to someone that was running her own social media business and wanted to get better with her business and improve her finances  she was getting through a relationship that she had just ended ''everyone had something to bring to the table  of course, we all do  if we re honest with ourselves, everyone has something they re trying to work on  i went in there and day one was awesome  tony got out there and he spoke for like 12 hours we were there  until after midnight  yeah, he s a complete mutant  yeah, it s unbelievable ''kevin rose  i don t even know when he pees  i have no idea when he uses the bathroom  or drinks water  yeah  he s just a machine, the guy s a machine ''kevin rose  he s a machine  i walked over the coals with him  he was like,  bring out some fresh coals for kevin!  of course, they put like fresh, you actually walk over coals at the end of the night  you ve done this, right?''tim ferriss  i have, yeah ''kevin rose  did he bring out fresh coals for you?''tim ferriss  i can t recall if he brought out fresh coals for me  i think that might ve been the vip treatment you received ''kevin rose  it was a lot of fun  i think the biggest takeaway for me was really a couple things  one was definitely this thing called the wheel of life  did you have to do that? where you fill out your wheel?''tim ferriss  i m sure i did  and i should also point out that for the attendees at these events   and i have a little bit more to say about this   but the exercises that really   and there are very tactical, prescriptive exercises   but that the exercises that change someone else s trajectory and give them extremely concrete next steps that have an impact, are very often completely different exercises from those that affect the person right next to you  it s really something to behold  but tell us about the wheel of life ''kevin rose  the wheel of life was interesting in that he gives you these areas of your life and you re to rank them from 0 to 10 on how far along and how happy you are with those areas  so, for example, physical body  so, for me, i was like, for me, i give myself a 4 in this arena  i could be doing a lot better  then there s emotions and meaning  another one is relationships  another one is time  another one is your career and your mission in life  then there s finances  then the last one is how you contribute  how you give back  how you celebrate and contribute  so you go from 0 to 10 and you rank these out  you ll see my wheel doesn t actually look like a wheel  it s kind of lopsided, but that s by design ''by the time you look at this, it gives you a clear view of okay, i really need to step out how i contribute and give back  that allowed me to go really deep in my own personal life and say, what does it mean to contribute and give back for me? you and i have both done things in terms of going out  like charity  water, the tony hawk foundation, and giving away money, but just supporting a cause and writing a check, i  don t know how you feel about this, but for me, it doesn t really mean that i m giving back  i don t really feel like i m contributing  yes, i m giving cash, but i m not actually taking part in that process  i m not actually really helping out  anyone can write a check ''what does it mean for me to contribute? the realization that i came to and actually there s some really powerful moments in this conference where they turn out the lights and they make you revisit certain times in your childhood and all these things  i felt myself kind of tearing up because one of the things i realized is that i was not giving back and contributing in a meaningful way  the thing that i came to and that i realized is that my mother was verbally abused by my father for many, many, many years  definitely abusive behavior  never physically harmed her, but i would say the mental hard is more bad, if not worse, than some of the physical harm  i realized that i want to actually lean in and help out women that have been abused and that are currently in abusive relationships ''a goal of mine over the next couple years is finding the best possible way to contribute back to that  not just in forms of another check, but actually how i can get involved  and whether that means helping them build their products and build a better website or mobile apps or any way that i can enable and use my technology skills to help with their business would be something that would mean a lot to me  so, that was a great experience to have  i wouldn t have that if it wasn t for tony  that was just one of many things that i got out of the weekend  i would say that he s a badass  it was pretty awesome  yeah, he s a real master of his craft  what i would say to folks who have a certain image of tony is that when you go to an event like this, i think the right way to approach it is to be skeptical but not cynical, and open to trying all of the exercises he suggests  there are going to be components that may not agree with you in the sense that there s a lot of jumping around  there s a lot of music  there s a lot of noise, for lack of a better word  a lot of those elements made me uncomfortable  they re not things that i would seek out ''kevin rose  oh, my god  i could not see you dancing and jumping around  right? it s just not my thing  but the filter that i used going into it or the lens through which i was looking at it was it was made easier because one of my very close friends i ve known since college, who s had multiple company exits, is extremely, extremely accomplished, and he goes to unleash the power within every year as a reset  he s been 11 times, maybe 12 now  he s been to date with destiny six times  this guy is not a seminar junkie  he s not someone who avoids the work and goes to listen to a motivational speech so that he can feel better on a sugar high for two days and not take any next steps  this is not that guy  he is an operator ''so, the fact that he had been so many times really led me to want to stick with the entire event  i m not going to lie  i had hard points  then i mentioned this to you and it may not be the exercise that had a large impact on you, but the dickens process that i ended up with tony including in tools of titans, one of my more recent books, because it had such a big impact, made the entire event an easy like 10 to 100 turn for me ''kevin rose  mm hmm, that was the last day, too  that s right  so, just that 30 to 60 minute exercise led me to dramatically improve my relationship with my father, to take responsibility for certain things that i had been telling myself were unchangeable, to really buckle down and step into discomfort to make some meaningful changes  those are changes   unleash the power within, i want to say i went to, now it s got to be three to five years ago   those changes, the ripple effects of those changes that i made then are still very tangible now  then date with destiny, very similar ''but to go into it expecting that if you step into it and accept some level of discomfort and commit to trying everything, this is just my view, that at least 50 percent you re going to end up discarding  probably 20 percent you re going to find really uncomfortable and you re going to dislike actively  then like 10 to 25 percent you re going to go, holy shit, i can t believe how powerful that just was  it s not a lot of handwavy, woo woo ambiguity  these exercises are really, really, really specific  so, you don t have to accept tony as your one and only savior  you don t have to believe that he is flawless because he is not  he s just like everyone else  he s an imperfect creature trying to do the best with the gifts and talents he s developed  but the guy knows his shit  he actually really cares ''as i ve gotten to know him over the last few years more and more so, i ve become more impressed with him, not less impressed  that is at least, if one were thinking of attending one of these events, and i have zero vested interest in sending anyone to these events, other than they ve had a material impact on my life  that s why i was happy to see that you were going to attend  that they d go in with an open mind expecting that, much like if you ve read any type of book, you re not expecting every line to be a life changing piece of gold  you re hoping that net net it s going to be worth the time that you invested  that s been my takeaway  that it s absolutely been worth the time invested ''kevin rose  yeah, 100 percent agree  i think that like you, going into this was certainly a really uncomfortable thing for me in terms of when they first start the music and people come out on stage and they start dancing  you can tell the people that have been there before, because they immediately like jump out of their seats and start rocking out and throwing their hands in the air  i m thinking to myself, i hate dancing  i hate dancing  i ve never liked dancing with anyone  my wife or anyone  i always feel so awkward when i m doing it  i m a geek that likes to sit in front of my computer at night  then i thought something another friend had told me who had gone and said,  hey, kevin  you just have to go with it  if you want to get anything out of it, you have to realize that he s doing this by design to put you into a certain state  ''he wants to get you into an optimal state and an optimal   that can mean like, one example of one thing we did is we took something that was very serious to us, like a limiting belief that you had held so seriously and you say it out loud in a very joking and laughing way, and everybody, like 12,000 people are all doing this at the same time  you re laughing and saying it  it s like breaking it down in your mind and letting you know that you don t have to take it so seriously and you can joke about it and have fun with it because it s been forever since you ve probably ever done that in your life  when was the last time you were able to take something that you held so seriously and so guarded and have a good time with it? so, he knows how to set up these little traps for you that trick you into reframing things in your mind  it really does change your long term perspective on things ''dude, i m a fan  i would definitely go back again  i did the three day event, the unleash the power within, the same one as you  but yeah, i had fun with it  so, thanks for helping out with that  yeah, man  my pleasure  i would suggest also that as a point of social proof, and, of course, tony s fully aware of the sort of gravitas this would bring, but there are people, for instance, mark benioff of salesforce, which i think has more than  10 billion in annual revenue now, who will pointblank say that salesforce would probably not exist were it not for tony robbins  and he still attends some of these events  he was right behind me at date with destiny  he s a big guy  he and tony are very similar in size  then you have paul tudor jones  you have some of the most sophisticated traders and financial minds who have worked with tony for 10 to 20 years  that s on an ongoing coaching basis because he does have very discrete, very tactical exercises and tools that help to find blind spots and fully leverage the things that you re good at and so on ''it s not easy  it s not comfortable, but certainly i ve been very benefitted by the time that i ve spent considering these things  i m biased because in high school, i read unlimited power by tony, which had an impact  i then, when i got out of college and i had my first job and i was commuting in my piece of shit minivan, the green machine, which was just a complete disaster of a car but i was trapped on 101 in the bay area, for people who know, just bumper to bumper in rush hour, to and from mountain view to san jose to work, and i would listen to this used set  i couldn t afford the full set, a new copy, so i had personal power 2 in cassette tape, and listened to that, which helped me get to the point where i started my first company  tony s made these appearances at very opportune moments in my life ''like i said, i don t go to him for all things  i don t think tony has the answer to everything  but with particular types of self imposed narratives and handicaps that you have built you re or walls around certain types of thinking or certain types of emotions that perhaps served you very well in the past but no longer serve you, he is exceptionally good and helping you work through all of that ''kevin rose  i just love that this whole genre, the self help genre, is not as frowned upon as it used to be  i don t know if you remember, but probably 10, 15, 20 years ago, if you went to that area of the bookstore, you were like, look it, who s in the self help section? there must be something wrong with them  seriously  that used to be the case  now it s gone and he s probably at the center of it  but it s become this idea of not self help, it s really just this idea that we re all on a journey of lifelong learning and we all are done bsing ourselves and there s not a single person that has all of life figured out, so why don t we all actively, openly work on this together? i think it s awesome  yeah  i should also say that as one point, as an example, i was interviewed on the bbc  they wanted to talk about the self help genre  i knew it was going to be setup, right? i knew that they wanted me to defend self help and they wanted to attack self help  i knew when i was going in that this is what it was going to be  or i figured it out about an hour beforehand when i got some notes and i was like,  oh, i see where this is going   they bring me out   this is a television show   and they say,  good evening, mr  ferriss  we just wanted to talk about,  dah dah dah, bio, blah, blah, blah,  what is your general opinion of the self help genre?  or something along those lines ''in effect, i said,  i think 99 9  of it is just horseshit   i said,  it pains me sometimes to be associated with the label  self help  for x, y, and z reasons   then they didn t have a leg to stand on, right? because i d taken their side of the argument, which was kind of hilarious ''kevin rose  that s funny  then i said,  but, at the same time, i think the label  self help  has in many cases an unfairly negative connotation because if you look at almost any type of reading, whether it s a novel where people want to escape, or it s nonfiction, where they re hoping to learn more about let s call it andrew carnegie, or you name the figure, there is some motive behind that, which they hope to help them   whether it s a shift of emotion, the gathering of knowledge so they can impress people at a dinner party or otherwise  and that if i were to look at who i would say potentially emulate in the world of self help, it would probably be like, and this is a name you brought up earlier, ben franklin  who most certainly wrote extensively about what we consider today to be self help  but he s not lumped into the category of potential   and these people do exist, certainly   charlatans, who are just selling a bill of goods that doesn t deliver ''there are plenty of people who have not walked the walk and talk extensively about their expertise and make recommendations and prescriptions  there are people all over the world in every possible disciple who do this and a lot of them tend to concentrate in this section of the bookstore called  self help,  unfortunately  but that alone isn t enough to disqualify something  certainly, if we look at the popularity of tutorials on youtube, for instance, in any possible subject matter  if you look at the popularity of the creative lives and the courseras and so on  everyone now has access to expertise that even 10 years ago would ve cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to access, if they had the ability at all  you look at harvard, mit, stanford  many of these schools are putting their courses online, in some cases, for free access  i know people who have taught themselves to code in this way ''all of that is self help, right? it s important, i think, that people not disqualify exploring certain realms because of a label that really represents a concept which may or may not apply to what it is you re examining ''kevin rose  yeah, i mean, there s going to be scammers in every genre, too  i love how joe rogan, i don t know if you ve seen the posts that he s done recently, but he does video of these martial arts?''tim ferriss  the legit as fuck? yeah  that s his caption ''kevin rose  where they can throw people with their mind? yeah  yeah  joe rogan puts up these fake martial arts videos  i mean, they re not fake  they re videos of people who actually believe that what s happening is happening  but these self described martial arts masters throwing people across the room with their qi explosions and so on  his caption is usually,  legit as fuck   or  legitasfuck ''kevin rose  it s so good  it s so good  yeah, there s a lot of nonsense out there, but it doesn t mean that everything within a certain category is nonsense  it doesn t mean you should spend your entire life filtering for the one percent  but also, there are ways that you can assess the validity of different paths  quite frankly, i would recommend for those people who haven t   well, i ll give you two recommendations  one is you can look at the back of the 4 hour body, if you already have it, there s an appendix which is effectively how to spot bad science  it will help you to not trick yourself and also to get better at avoiding being tricked  so, that s one recommendation  not to seem like i m selling my own book, the excerpts for that appendix are from a book called bad science by a doctor named ben goldacre, which is absolutely fantastic ''so, if you just want to be scientifically literate or better able to separate the signal from the noise with the deluge of information that we are assaulted by every day, i would highly recommend that you check out one or both of those resources ''kevin rose  i was going to ask you, tools of titans, obviously in your books there have been tons of book recommendations  there was that one kid, do you remember the kid, that took all and he created, he took all the books out of your recommendations and ranked them?''tim ferriss  yeah, he ranked them or just organized them as thumbnails  yeah, i do remember that ''kevin rose  the idea was that what is the most recommended book inside tools of titans across the board by all the people that were in that book? kind of stack ranking them based on the votes  do you have that list anywhere? do you have a list of like the most recommended books by all of your guests?''tim ferriss  i do, actually  i ll pull it up right now because i put it on the blog for everybody ''kevin rose  that s a great way to cut through all the crap, you know?''tim ferriss  yeah, i put it up on the blog  if you give me a second, i will find where it is  this might take a second  i m looking at tribe of mentors, the most recent  where would i find this? if you go onto tim blog and search tools of titans books ''kevin rose  we can put a link in the show notes, right?''tim ferriss  we ll put a link in the show notes  this will be the smarter way to do it  if you want to see a page where the most commonly recommended books from tools of ''titans and from tribe of mentors, combined, you re looking at about 500 different world class performers of all different disciplines, ranging from top professional athletes to chess prodigies, to former generals, certainly 12  billionaires, then you will get to see rank ordered in terms of frequency which books are most recommended  i will put those in the show notes and you guys can find that at tim blog podcast  if you want to see of these people who are the best at what they do, which books across disciplines do they recommend most often ''a few of them, just off the bat for people who are curious  man s search for meaning by viktor frankl  poor charlie s almanac by charlie munger  seeking wisdom by peter bevelin  and certainly atlas shrugged, even though it s a controversial book, by ayn rand, comes up a lot in terms of developing a sense of personal agency  i think that has popped up quite a lot  and many more  but i ll give you the full list because there are some that pop up quite frequently that you won t recognize at all  those are, to me, oftentimes the really fun ones to explore ''kevin rose  awesome  yeah, i ve got a bunch of audible credits waiting to be spent  so, i ll do that  awesome, man  well, i think this is a solid catch up ''kevin rose  yeah  thanks for having me on  it was fun to chat  where can people learn more about kevin rose, find you on the interwebs?''kevin rose  certainly  my podcast is available at kevinrose com  then also if you want to check out my free meditation app, it s 100 percent free, a little bit more traditional meditation  it s called oak and you can do that at oakmeditation com  nice and succinct  no social?''kevin rose  yeah, you know, twitter  but i don t know that i use it that much anymore  i m more a newsletter guy  if you go to my website, you can sign up for my newsletter  i do a once a month newsletter  that s kind of what i use  it s a good newsletter  i subscribe to it, which i can t say for many  yeah, twitter has turned into a bit of a nasty neighborhood on most days  you just feel like you re minding your business, whistling, walking down the street, then you have people throwing potted plants at your head ''kevin rose  and then facebook is a whole shit show  so, it s like, that s the worst kind of show  what to do? go back to the tried and true ''kevin rose  instagram  instagram or email  all right, my man  well, thanks so much for taking the time  i hope to see you soon  come visit austin  got a barrel sauna waiting for you ''kevin rose  i will  awesome  see ya  see ya  to everyone listening or watching on the youtubes, you can find links to everything that we ve talked about in the show notes at tim blog podcast  until next time, be safe, do not take meth for fun, follow professional advice with anything medically related, and live the examined life  just because it is self help doesn t mean it can t help you  i ll leave with that '"
26,27,"25, 26, 27: Kevin Kelly ","   hello ladies and gentlemen, this is tim ferriss, and welcome to another episode of the tim ferriss show  and to start off, as i often do, with a quote  this is from one of my favorite writers of all time, kurt vonnegut, and it goes as follows  ""here is a lesson in creative writing  first rule, do not use semicolons  they are transvestite hermaphrodites representing absolutely nothing  all they do is show that you've been to college "" i have the habit of using dashes in the same way, so i like to read this to remind me not to use that crutch  also ""pretty"", the adverb, i overuse that  in any case, kurt vonnegut, lots of lessons, lots of amazing books  if you need one to start with, go with cat's cradle  today's guest is kevin kelly  kevin kelly is one of the most interesting human beings i have ever met  he's a dear friend  as for the bio, kevin kelly is senior maverick at wired magazine which he co founded in 1993  he also co founded the all species foundation, a non profit aimed at cataloging and identifying every living species on earth  in all his spare time, he writes best selling books, he co founded the rosetta project, which is building an archive of all documented human languages, and he serves on the board of the long now foundation, which i've been honored to join as a speaker on one occasion  as part of the long now foundation, he's looking into, among other things, how to revive and restore endangered or extinct species, including the woolly mammoth  i'm not making this stuff up, kevin is amazing  this is going to be a multi part episode, so there'll be a number of different podcast episodes, because we went quite long  i hope you enjoy it  you can find all links, show notes, and so on, once we complete the entire series, at fourhourworkweek com podcast  you can also find all previous  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    episodes i've done in this podcast  fourhourworkweek com podcast, all spelled out  without further ado, please enjoy, and thank you for listening  kevin, thank you so much for being on the show  kevin kelly   it's my honor   tim ferriss   i am endlessly fascinated by all of the varied projects that you constantly have going on  but that leads me to the first question, which is, when you meet someone who is not familiar with your background and they ask you the age old ""what do you do?"" question, how do you even begin to answer that? what is your stock answer to that?  kevin kelly   these days, my stock answer is that i package ideas into books and magazines and websites, and i make ideas interesting and pretty   tim ferriss   ooh, i like the ""pretty""  we'll come back to the aesthetic aspect, i think that's a really neglected piece of the entire puzzle  you do have, of course, a background     a lot of people are familiar with your background with wired, but perhaps you could give folks a bit of background on yourself  is it true that you dropped out of college after one year?  kevin kelly   yeah, i'm a college drop out  actually, my one regret in life is that one year that i came  (laughs)  tim ferriss   oh, no kidding?  kevin kelly   yeah, i wish i had just even skipped that  but i do understand how college can be useful to people  my own children have gone through     but for me, it was just not the right thing, and i went to asia instead  i like to tell myself that i gave my own self a phd in east asian studies, by traveling around and photographing very remote parts of asia at a time when it was in a transition from the ancient world to the modern world  i did many other things as well, and for me, it was a very formative  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    time, because i did enough things that when i finally got my first real job at the age of 35     tim ferriss   (laughs) wow  which job was that?  kevin kelly   i worked for a non profit at 10 dollars an hour, which was the whole earth catalog  which had been a life long dream  i said if i'm going to have a job, that was the job i want  it took me a long time to get it  but in between that, i did many things, including starting businesses and selling businesses, and doing other kinds of things, more adventures  and i highly recommend it  i got involved in starting wired and running wired for a while, and hired a lot of people who were coming right out of college  they were internists and they would do the intern thing, and then they were good and we would hire them  which meant that, basically, after 10 years, whatever it was     this was their first and only job, and i kept telling them, ""why are you here? what are you doing? you should be fooling around, wasting time, trying something crazy  why are you working a real job? i don't understand it "" i just really recommend slack  i'm a big believer in this thing of kind of doing something that's not productive  productive is for your middle ages  when you're young, you want to be prolific and make and do things, but you don't want to measure them in terms of productivity  you want to measure them in terms of extreme performance, you want to measure them in extreme satisfaction  it's a time to try stuff, and i think      tim ferriss   explore the extremes   kevin kelly   exactly  explore the possibilities, and there are so many possibilities, and there's more every day  you don't want  it's called ""premature optimization""  you really want to use this time to continue to do things  and by the way, premature optimization is a problem of success, too  it's not just the problem of the young, it's the problem of the successful more than even of the young  but we'll get to that  that's a long answer, too  (laughs)  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   that might turn into a therapy session for me at this precise moment in time, in fact   kevin kelly   (laughs) yes, exactly   tim ferriss   but when you are exploring that slack, i would imagine many people feel pressure, whether it's internal pressure or societal, familial pressure, to get a real job, to support themselves  a lot of the decisions are made out of fear  they worry about being out on the streets, or it's a nebulous, terror, anxiety  how did you support yourself, for instance, while you were traveling through asia when you left school?  kevin kelly   i totally understand this anxiety and fear and stuff  but here's the thing, i think one of the many life skills that you want to actually learn at a fairly young age is the skill of being, like, ultra thrifty, minimal, kind of this little wisp that's traveling through time     in the sense of learning how little you actually need to live, not just in a survival mode, but in a contented mode  i learned that pretty early, by backpacking and doing other things, especially in asia     was i could be very happy with very, very little  you can go onto websites and stuff, and look at the minimum amount of stuff  food, say, that you need to live, your basic protein, carbohydrates, and vitamins, and actually, if you bought them in bulk, how much it would cost  i mean, you build your own house, live in a shelter, a tiny house  you don't need very much  i think trying that out, building your house on the pond, like thoreau, who was a hero of mine in high school, is not just a simple exercise, it's a profound exercise, because it allows you to get over the anxiety  even if you aren't living like that, you know that if the worse came to worst, you could keep going at a very low rate and be content  that gives you the confidence to take a risk, because you say, ""what's the worst that can happen? well, the worst that can happen is that i'd have a backpack and a sleeping bag, and i'd be eating oatmeal  and i'd be fine "" i think if you do that once or twice     you don't necessarily have to live like that, but knowing that you can be content is tremendously empowering   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   definitely   kevin kelly   that's what i did, that's basically what i did  was living in asia where the people around me had less than i did and they were pretty content  you realize, ""oh my gosh, i don't really need very much to be happy ""  tim ferriss   did you save up money beforehand with odd jobs, or did you do odd jobs while on the road? a bit of both?  kevin kelly   i did odd jobs before i left  i was traveling in asia at a time when the price differential was so great, that it actually made sense for me to fly back on a charter flight to the us, and work for four or five months  i worked, basically, odd jobs  i worked from working at a warehouse packaging athletic shoes, working in a technical sense of a     it's really just hard to describe, but it was a photography related job where we're reducing printed circuit boards down to little sizes to be shipped off to be printed     and driving cars, to whatever else i could find  that, at that time, made more money  i could live off of  i could live probably two years from those couple months of work  i didn't really work while i was traveling until i got to iran in the late '70s, and there was a very high paying job which was teaching english to the iranian pilots who worked for the shah  but i had sworn i was never going to teach english, so i actually got a job in bell helicopter, who was teaching english to the pilots  but my job was running a little newsletter for the american community there  i worked there until i was thrown out by the coup  that was another story   tim ferriss   now, just a couple of comments  number one, for those people listening who are saying to themselves, already perhaps creating reasons why they can't do what you did now, due to different economic climate or whatnot     it is entirely possible to replicate what you did  you just have to choose your locations wisely, for that type of    kevin kelly   yeah, absolutely   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   i should also just mention to people that part of the reason i'm so attracted to stoic philosophy, whether that be seneca or marcus aurelius, is exactly because of the practice of poverty  not because you want to be poor, but so that you recognize not only that you can subsist, but then you can potentially be content or even, in some cases, be more content with a bare minimum  for people who are more interested in that, i highly recommend a lot of the stoic writings, and you can search for those on my blog and elsewhere  but   kevin kelly   let me just add to that  there's actually a new age version of that that was sort of popular a generation ago, and the search term there is ""volunteer simplicity""   tim ferriss   ""volunteer simplicity""?  kevin kelly   right  the idea is, poverty is terrible when it's mandatory, when you have no choice, but the voluntary version of that is very, very powerful  i think attaching names sometimes to things makes it more legitimate, but imagine yourself practicing voluntary simplicity  that, i think, is part of that stoic philosophy, but there's a whole movement     a lot of the hippie drop outs were kind of practicing a similar thing, and there was a whole ""best practices"" that resolved around that  you can make up your own  but i think it's, to me, an essential life skill that people should acquire  i mean, when you go backpacking and stuff like that, that's part of it  that's the beginnings of trying to understand what it is that you need to live as a being, and you can fill that out in any way you want, but that's a good way to experiment   tim ferriss   now, you have become certainly a world class packager of ideas, but also at synthesizing and expressing these ideas  i love your writing, i've consumed vast quantities of it  (laughs) in fact, i'm here right now on long island where i grew up, and i used to sneak into my parent's shed to read old editions of the whole earth catalog for inspiration  it was, i suppose, the equivalent of my internet at the time  (laughs) and from that, all the way to 1000 true fans, which of course you know i shout from the rooftops for people to read  how did you  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    develop that skill of writing and communicating? a lot of people associate that with schooling, but it doesn't appear to be the source for you  kevin kelly   yeah  in high school, i would call myself a very late bloomer  i don't recall myself having a lot of ideas  there were a lot of other people and kids in my high school that i was very impressed with, because they seemed to know what they thought and were very glib and articulate, and i wasn't  i was a little bit more visual in that sense  i was trying to decide whether to go to art school or to mit, because i was really interested in science  i set off to asia as a photographer, so it was basically no words at all, it was just images  and as i was traveling and seeing these amazing things     i mean, again, i want to emphasize that this was sort of a     for me, i grew up in new jersey, i had never left new jersey, we never took vacations  it's hard to describe how parochial new jersey was back in the 1960s  i never ate chinese food, i never had     i mean, i never saw chinese  it was a different world  and then i was thrown into asia and it was like, ""oh my gosh,"" everything i knew was wrong  so that education was extremely, extremely powerful  i think that that gave me something to say, and i started writing letters home, trying to describe what i was seeing  i had a reason to try to communicate  that was the beginning of it, but even then, i don't think i really had much to say  it wasn't really until the internet came along, and i had a chance to go onto one of the first online communities in the early '80s, and for some reason      tim ferriss   the early '80s? that is definitely     early days   kevin kelly   yeah, it was in 1981  these were private, it wasn't the wideopen internet  these were little experiment  in fact, it was new jersey institute of technology in rutgers that had this experimental online community that i got invited on     we can talk about how that happened, but it was just luck and a friend  and i found that there was something about the direct attempt  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    to just communicate with someone else in real time, just sending them a message or something, that crystallized my thinking  what it turned out, istim ferriss   how did it crystallize your thinking? not to interrupt, but was it the immediate feedback loop?  kevin kelly   it was the idea that     teachers have since done a lot of studies where they had kids write an essay on something, an assignment, and then they would also be instructed to write some e mail to a friend or something  then they would grade both of the compositions, and they would find that, inevitably, the e mail that the kids were writing was much better writing  because when you're trying to write a composition, we have all these attitudes, or expectations, or there's kind of this ""writer ly sense""  there's all this other garbage and luggage and baggage on top of that  but when we're just trying to send an e mail, we're just directly trying to communicate something  we're not fooling around, we're not trying to make it      tim ferriss   literary   kevin kelly   literary, all that  just direct stuff  so the writing there was always much more direct and concrete  that's the usual thing that happens when you're trying to write, is you're not concrete enough  but when you e mail, it's all concrete  so it was getting out of the whole writer ly stuff and just pure, concrete communication, that really made it for me  what i discovered, which is what many writers discover, is that i write in order to think  it was like, ""i think i have an idea,"" but when i begin to write it, i realize, ""i have no idea,"" and i don't actually know what i think until i try and write it  writing is a way for me to find out what i think  it's like, i don't have any ideas, it's true, but when i write, i get the ideas  that was the revelation  so by being forced to communicate online, there was none of this expectation  it was just like, ""ok, just write an e mail  i can do that  i don't have to write an essay, i don't have to write something nice  i'm just going to write 140 characters  i can do that "" but while i was doing that, i had an idea that i didn't have  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    before  it was like, ""oh my gosh, this is an idea generation machine, it's by writing  it's not that i have these ideas and i'm going to write them down  no, no  i don't even have them until i write them "" tim ferriss   i'm so glad you brought that up, because i was just recently  a few things related to that  i was reading an interview with kurt vonnegut, who's one of my favorite authors  for people who aren't familiar, check out cat's cradle perhaps, as a starting point  hilarious guy, and he, at various points in his career, taught writing to make ends meet  and he would, number one, not look for good writers, he would look for people who are passionate about specific things   kevin kelly   yep, right   tim ferriss   that's something i want to reiterate to people who don't feel ""writer ly"", is that     go out and have the experiences and find the subjects, the things that excite you  as long as you're true to your voice, which is related to the e mail point     i threw out my first two drafts of, i'd say, a third of the four hour work week, because they were either too pompous and ivy leaguesounding      kevin kelly   (laughs)  tim ferriss   way, way, way too much  i mean, horrible  or too slapstick, because i felt like i had to go to the other extreme  and then i sat down and i wrote as if i were composing an e mail to a friend after two glasses of wine, and that's how i found my ""voice"" so to speak  as a side note, why   and i think this might be related   but why did you promise yourself not to teach english? i'm so curious  because that can be very lucrative, it's readily available     when you were traveling, why did you commit to yourself not to teach english?  kevin kelly   yeah, it's a good question, because there was lots of opportunities all around the world  by the way, i recommend it as a way for people to travel cheaply, if you want to support  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    yourself, because it is a very desirable ""skill"", we call it, for the moment  i think the reason why was i felt that     i didn't feel like i was a very good teacher, and i also felt that it was maybe a little easy? but i think the main reason was that i was having trouble imagining myself enjoying it  i just felt that i would rather try to find something else  now, i think i did, one time in taiwan which as you know, has a whole cram school system   i think i substituted for a friend once  and i think that maybe confirmed my idea (laughter), that while there was sort of     you know, all i have to do is just talk, i mean, there was really not much skill involved at all  it was fun, but i didn't feel like i was     i don't know, i didn't feel like i was maybe adding value or something  i came away thinking, ""you know, i guess i could do this for money, but i'm not going to be happy "" i think it was just a personality thing  i don't think of myself as a teacher, i don't do many workshops or classes  i think a different person might thoroughly enjoy it and i know they do and they have a great time doing it  for me, it was just     not for me  tim ferriss   mm hmm, got it   kevin kelly   no big deal  i think this is an important thing, is that it takes a long time to figure out what you're good for  part of where i'm at right now and where i got eventually, was really trying to spend time on doing things that only i can do  even when i can do something well but someone else could do it, i would try and let that go  that's a discipline that i'm still working on, which is not just things that i'm good at, but things that only i'm good at  that was something i was sort of trying to start early on, which is like, ""you know, a lot of other people can do this, and they're happy doing it  so i want to go somewhere where it requires more of me to do, and then i'll be happier and they'll be happier ""  tim ferriss   i am currently having   and i seem to have these periodically   a crisis of meaning phase   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin kelly   (laughs)  tim ferriss   i'm wrestling with this exact issue  trying to figure out what to abandon, what to say ""no"" to, to refine my focus, so i can really focus on the intersection of my unique capability or capabilities, whatever that is, and a need of some type  how did you figure that out     and maybe we could approach it from a different direction  what do you feel is your skill set or your unique skill, and how did you figure that out?  kevin kelly   well, let me tell you the story of how this realization actually came to me in a very concrete way, was while i was editing wired magazine  part of what wired magazine is about is that we would come up with ideas and make assignments to writers  now, some of the articles in wired would come from the writers themselves, they would approach us if they have an idea  but a lot of the articles would be assigned from editors  we'd have editorial meetings where we'd imagine this great article, and then we'd go and try and find someone to write it  and in that conversation of trying to persuade writers to write an idea that i had     it would go through a very typical sequence, where i would have this great idea, and then i would try to persuade, like, one writer, two writers, three writers, and they just didn't think it was a very good idea  they didn't like it, they didn't want to do it, whatever it was  i'd kind of forget about it, but then, like, six months later it would come back and i'd say, ""oh, that was such a great idea, i really think we should do that "" and i would go again for another round of trying to persuade people, and then i'd get no takers  and then i kind of""oh, forget about that, it must have been a bad idea "" but then, like, six months later or a year later, it might come back, ""you know, that's still a great idea  nobody has done that "" then i would realize, ""oh my gosh, i need to do that!"" (laughter) it was like, ""i'm the only one who can see this  i've tried to give it away, i've tried really hard to give it away, i've tried to kill it     ""  tim ferriss   (laughs) it just keeps on coming back!  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin kelly   keeps coming back! and then i would do it and it would be one of my best pieces  so i became really an important proponent of trying to give things away first  tell everybody what you're doing     basically you try to give these ideas away, and people are happy because they love great ideas  you can  ""hey, do it, it's a great idea  you should do it "" i'd try to give everything away first, and then i'd try to kill everything, like, ""no, that's a bad idea,"" and then it's the ones that keep coming back that i can't kill and i can't give away, that i think, ""hmm, maybe that's the one i'm supposed to do "" because no one else is going to do it  i mean, i've been actively trying to get     and then of course, if someone else is doing it, you see someone else competing or trying to do it, it was like, ""oh yeah, go ahead, do it  i'm not going to race against you  that's crazy because there's two of us  no, you do it "" so that generosity is actually part of this thing   tim ferriss   your vetting process   kevin kelly   exactly  that's when i kind of realized it  but that doesn't answer the question of, ""well, how do you find out what it is?"" all i can say is     and i don't want to fib, but all i can say is, it's going to take all your life to figure that out  that is fact  here's what it is   figuring out is what your life is about  (laughter) i mean, that's what life is for  life is to figure it out, so every part of your life, every day, is actually this attempt to figure this out  you'll have different answers as you go along, and sometimes there may be directions in that  but that's basically what it is  you were very transparent about confessing this, but i have to tell you that even from hanging around a lot of very accomplished people, a lot of successful people, that we would be on the covers of magazines     they also go through exactly the same questioning  no matter how big of a billion dollar company they have, they come up to the same thing   what's my role in all this? why am i here, what am i useful  what am i doing that nobody else can? it's a continuous     in fact, as we'll come back to, being successful makes that even more difficult   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   why is that?  kevin kelly   because of what i call the ""creator's dilemma"", which is very much the same thing as the ""innovator's dilemma""  it's a true dilemma, in the sense that there's no right answer  but the question is  is it better to optimize your strengths or to invest into the unknown, into places where you're weak?  tim ferriss   or places you haven't explored   kevin kelly   yeah  any accountant in any business would tell you that it absolutely makes more sense to take your dollar     you'll get a higher return by investing into what you're good at already, whatever it is  this is pursuit of excellence, this is tom peters and the whole entire movement, which is you move uphill, you keep optimizing what you know  that, by far, is the sanest, the most reasonable, the smartest thing to do  but when you have a very fast changing landscape like we live in right now, you get stuck on a local optima, you get stuck  the problem is, is that the only way you can get to a higher, more fit place, is you actually have to go down  you actually have to head into a place where you are less optimal, you have no expertise, there's very low margins, there's low profits, you'll look foolish, there'll be failures  and if you've been following a line of success, that is very, very difficult to do  it's very difficult for an organization  it's literally almost impossible for an organization who's been excellent and successful to do, it really is   tim ferriss   which presents a lot of opportunity for the     the start ups   kevin kelly   that's why the start ups all start there  the reason why start ups start is because they're operating in an environment that no sane, big corporation would want to be in  it's a market with low margins, low profitability, unproven, high failure  i mean, it's like, who wants to operate there? nobody! the only reason why start ups operate is they have no choice!  tim ferriss   right  (laughs) yeah, that's the gift of few options, right?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin kelly   right, exactly  so in terms of success biting, i think you have to be unsuccessful  who is successful, wants to be unsuccessful? it's very, very hard to let go of that success  that's one of the things that works against someone really continuing on this life journey of finding out what they're really good at it  because here's the thing   successful companies and successful people generally try to solve problems with money  you buy solutions  and we all know that money is not the full answer for innovation  basically, if you could purchase innovations, all the big companies would just purchase them  it's the fact that these innovations often have to be found out without money, through other means  again, that's the advantage to the start up, and it's a disadvantage to the successful companies because they got money and they just want to buy solutions  but most of these solutions you can't buy, you have to kind of engineer in this very difficult environment of low margins, low success, low profits, that no one really wants to be in, but the start ups are forced to be in   tim ferriss   that's also an advantage, i would think, for beginners or novices compared to experts   kevin kelly   exactly   tim ferriss   they have less vested identify, less inertia, to have to reverse   kevin kelly   and that's back to my suggestion in the beginning, of why slack and fooling around when you're young is so important  because a lot of these innovations and things are found not by trying to solve a problem that can be monetized  it's in exploring this area without money  i mean, money is so overrated  it really      tim ferriss   could you elaborate on that? because i feel like this is a sermon i need to receive on some level   kevin kelly   (laughs) there's several things to say about  one is, obviously, if you're struggling to pay bills and mortgages and stuff     there's a certain amount that's needed  but here's the thing, accumulating enough money to do things is really a by product of other things  it's kind of a lubricant in a certain sense rather than a goal   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    great wealth, extreme wealth, is definitely overrated  i've had meals with a dozen billionaires, and they're no diff  i mean, their lives, lifestyles are no different  you don't want to have a billion dollars, let me put it that way  you really don't  there's nothing that you can really do with it that you can't do with a lot of less money  we'll set that aside  even just wealth itself, in this world where there is more and more abundance     even the money for, say, middle class is less significant in a certain sense, in the sense that     maybe their status, which is really not needed, but     the things that you want to do, the things that will make you content, the things that will satisfy you, the things that will bring you meaning     can usually  got better than having money  i mean, if you have a lot of time or a lot of money, it's always better to have a lot of time to do something  if you have a choice between having a lot of friends or a lot of money, you definitely want to have a lot of friends  i think there's a way even in which the technological progress that we're having is actually diminishing the role of money  and i want to be clear that i'm talking about money beyond the amount that you need to survive, but even that reflects back to what we were saying earlier, which is probably less than you think it is, to survive  so in a certain sense, most people see money as a means to get these other things, but there are other routes to these other things that are deeper and more constant and more durable and more powerful  money is a very small, one dimensional thing, that if you focus on that, it kind of comes and goes  and if you     whatever it is that you're trying to attain, you go to it more directly through other means, you'll probably wind up with a more powerful experience or whatever it is that you're after  and it'll be deeper, more renewable, than coming at it with money  travel is one of the great examples  many, many people who are working very hard, trying to save their money to retire so they can travel  well, i decided to flip it around and travel when copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    i was really young, when i had zero money  and i had experiences that basically even a billion dollars couldn't have bought  and it's not an uncommon sight, let me tell you, for young travelers who have very little money to be hanging out, doing something, and then there'll be some very wealthy people on their one week organized tour, looking at these young travelers, just saying, ""i wish i had more time "" (laughs) tim ferriss   yeah, i see it almost every time i go traveling  it reminds me of conversations i've had with rolf potts and also his book, vagabonding, which i just absolutely love  it was that book and walden that i took with me traveling when i had my own twoyear or so walkabout  he points out, in the beginning of vagabonding, that many people subscribe to the belief along the lines of charlie sheen's in the movie wall street, when he's asked what he's going to do when he makes his millions and he says, ""i'm going to get a motorcycle and ride across china "" (laughter) rolf of course points out that you could clean toilets in the us and save enough money to ride a motorcycle across china  (laughs)  kevin kelly   exactly   tim ferriss   let me ask you, this is maybe tangentially related, but you mentioned earlier that your middle age     your middle ages""middle ages"" maybe sounds odd, but in your middle age, that's when you optimize  and i find that horrifying on some level because i am so tired     i just turned 37 last week, and i'm really tired of certain types of optimizing, and the incremental slogging of making trains run slightly more efficiently on time  even though, like you said, from a strictly financial standpoint, the advice that i would receive from many people and have received when i've asked for advice is, ""here are one or two core areas you should focus on to optimize for income "" and on the flip side, i'm tempted to approach a kind of     not ""scorched earth"" but ""burned bridges"" approach, where i somehow use creative destruction to force me into another direction, to have these new experiences that i crave so much   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and you, just for people who aren't aware, i want to give     i remember going to the first ever quantified self meet up, you're part of the long now foundation  you've experimented in so many different arenas, and have looked so far into the future, and thought on such grand a scale, i aspire to do more of that     what would be your advice to someone? i know i have dozens of friends in the same position  they're, say, in their early  or mid 30s, in my particular peer group, and they want to explore but they're feeling pressured to optimize this thing that they've suddenly found their footing with, whatever it is  maybe they're a venture capitalist, maybe they're in start up, they feel they should start a new start up, and they want to step out of that slipstream  what would be your advice to those people? kevin kelly   well, first of all, i have to commend your honesty for this, and i will repeat that it is very, very difficult to do  i mean, i think the realization comes to people in middle age and they realize, ""oh my gosh, there's a little bit of a routine here and i'm not really happy with that "" i think that scorched earth, that kind of, you know, ""we'll just set fire to it and we'll walk away,"" i actually have     i think we probably have a mutual friend, i won't use his name because i don't know how public this is, but one of his solutions was the most radical one i've ever heard, to force himself, was that he gave up us citizenship   tim ferriss   oh, wow  yeah, that'll do it  (laughs)  kevin kelly   he was saying, ""i just feel so "" i was like, ""oh my gosh, that is so radical "" he was telling me about what is involved in that, and it wasn't for tax purposes, because actually before you can do it, the us actually requires that you square up on all taxes  but that was so radical, and i don't recommend that  (laughter) that's all i'm saying  i mean, he's doing fine, but i'm just saying that's unnecessary  i think the advice is     i'm probably taking a page from yourself  i don't think it's necessary to     i think you can experiment your way through this, you can do this incrementally  you can take small steps and do something, and then evaluate it, test how it's going, whether you're getting what  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    you want out of it, whether it's working, and then you continue in that direction  that's sort of the pattern of people who have second careers or ""reinvent themselves"", you hear that a lot  and you can do that in a disciplined, tim ferriss way  i don't think that it requires you to walk out and leave a burning pile behind  i think it's something that you're going to     i'm a big believer in doing things deliberately, and i think that you begin by looking at those areas that you get satisfaction out of, and those areas where     i often find that people kind of retreat back to the things that they did as kids and really, really miss, whether it's art or other things  the truth is, you're not really going to be able to escape all the other things you have going  and that's a good thing because that is part of you and part of what you do well  so you'll probably just bend in a certain direction  i think the one bit of advice is that you can't     it's not going to happen overnight  it took you 37 years to get where you are, it may take you another 30 years to get where you want to go  i don't think you should feel impatient, maybe that's the word i'm saying, is that i don't think you should imagine that you'll have another hat on with a new label next year  tim ferriss   just to maybe redirect that   and this may or may not be accurate   but in the process of researching for this conversation, which is an odd exercise in and of itself, given how much time we've spent together  (laughs) but i came across, in wikipedia, mention of your experience in jerusalem and deciding to live as though you only had six months left  i want to touch on that, but one of the questions that came to my mind when i turned 37 last week is, ""if i knew i were going to die at age 40, what would i do to have the greatest impact on the greatest number of people?"" so i find that constraint helpful and i worry that if i aim at not being impatient in that way, that i won't   because i could get hit by a bus   that i won't do what i'm capable of doing  maybe you could talk about     and i had no idea, i'm not sure if you would self describe yourself as a ""devout christian"", but that's certainly written here  maybe you could talk a little bit about that experience   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin kelly   yeah  one thing i would of course warn people is that, not everything on wikipedia is correct  (laughs)  tim ferriss   no, that's why i'm bringing it up  (laughs)  kevin kelly   but it is true that i got this assignment in jerusalem, which, by the way, if you want to hear the full version of it, listen to one of the very first ""this american life"", which ira glass and i told the story for the very first time  it's a story about how i got this assignment to live as if i was going to die in six months, even though i was perfect healthy and i knew that it was very improbable  but i decided to take the assignment seriously and that's what i did  my answer kind of surprised me, because i thought that i would have this sort of mad, high risk fling, do all these things, but actually what i wanted to do was to visit my brothers and sisters, go back to my parents, help out  my mom was not well at the time  but that lasted for three months before i decided i needed to do something big  so i actually road my bicycle across the us, from san francisco to new jersey, where i was going to basically die  i kept a journal of that  and that question was something that i keep asking myself now  i actually have a countdown clock that matt groening at futurama was inspired and they did a little episode of futurama about  what i did was, i took the actuarial tables for the estimated age of my death, for someone born when i was born, and i worked back the number of days  i have that showing on my computer, how many days  i tell you, nothing concentrates your time like knowing how many days you have left  now, of course, i'm likely, again, to live more than that  i'm in good health, etcetera  but nonetheless, there's something that really     i have 6,000 something days, it's not very many days to do all the things i want to do  so i think your exercise is really fantastic and commendable, and there's two questions   what would you do if you had six months to live, and what would you do if you had a billion dollars? and interestingly (laughs), it's the convergence of  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    those two questions  because it turns out that you probably don't need a billion dollars to do whatever it is that you're going to do in six months  so i think you're asking the right question  the way i answer it is, you want to keep asking yourself that question every six months and really try to answer it  i try to do that on a day by day basis  i learned something from my friend, stewart brand, who organized his remaining days around five year increments  he says any great idea that's significant, that's worth doing, for him, will last about five years, from the time he thinks of it, to the time he stops thinking about it  and if you think of it in terms of five year projects, you can count those off on a couple hands, even if you're young  so the sense of mortality, of understanding that it's not just old people who don't have very many     if you're 20 years old, you don't have that many fiveyear projects to do   tim ferriss   so i think it is     that's maybe part of the philosophy of thinking about our time and whether     even if you believe in the extension of life, longevity, living to 120, you still have to think in these terms of, what are you going to do if you   because you don't know if you'll live to be 120   what are you doing to do if you have a year, and what would you do with a billion dollars? and what's the intersection of those two? does religion play a large part in your life right now?  kevin kelly   in a certain sense, not in a ritualistic sense  i just wrote a book called what technology wants   tim ferriss   excellent book, i highly recommend it   kevin kelly   it was a theory of technology and i was trying to put technology in the context of the cosmos  i think what religion gives me is permission to think about cosmic questions  i'm right in the middle of finishing a kickstarter funded graphic novel that's about angels and robots  the intention there was to fictionalize the idea that robots would someday have souls, but these souls would be coming from angels and so that there was this  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    intersection of these two possible worlds of conscious robots who were en souled by angels  the reason why this was interesting was that the idea was that the angels that in soul less had been trained  they had been given moral guidance, but if you don't give the spirit some kind of moral guidance then they can wreak havoc  it was this idea that when we make robots we're also going to have to train them to be ethical  we just can't make a free being and not train it  it was a way to rehearse and think about some of the consequences of technology today  i think my religion gives me permission to ask those questions without embarrassment to say, ""well, what is the general direction of the arc of evolution? is it pointed somewhere? how does technology fit into the greater cosmos? what does it mean? what drives it? why is there more of it? is this a good thing? i consider this and other views so i have another view  i'm sympathetic to other world views  i don't necessarily have to believe all the other world views, but i get the idea that if you have another world view that can be very helpful in seeing other worldviews  people have a world view even though they don't know it, but i have a world view and i know that i have a world view  really, everybody has a religious or a spiritual orientation  even if they're atheists, they still have one  there are some assumptions that are at the basis of it and i like to question assumptions, including my own assumptions  tim ferriss   two things i can't resist asking and we can spend as much or as little time on this as you'd like, but recently grappling with a lot of these issues that i've been grappling with, some of which are existential, some of which are related to death, limited time on the planet, i have become deeply fascinating by indigenous use of plant medicine  i've had some very transformative experiences that are difficult to put into words because they make you sound like a complete crazy person  yeah, there's a something ness that is very difficult to communicate without sounding like you should be institutionalized   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    what do you think the role for people who aspire to do the greatest good in the world, what is the role of that type of direct experience? is it possible to benefit from that type of, for lack of a better descriptor ""spiritual experience"" without a religious framework around it? kevin kelly   yeah, yeah, no  it's a really good question  my little personal story there, of course, is i was basically a hippy  i worked for the hippy catalog, of the whole earth catalog, which was about hippies living in san francisco  all my friends were drug taking hippies, but i for some reason never did  i just had no appetite or inclination at all for ever taking any drugs or smoking pot or anything  when i was 50 years old i decided that i would like to take lsd sacramentally on of my 50th birthday and i did  i arranged with, i had a guide and i had an appropriate setting and i had some acid that came from a source that was extremely reliable and it was a sacrament  it was a very profound sacrament  i think, ""yeah, you can use the drugs recreationally and for entertainment,"" and i think that can go somewhere, but i think there's another powerful use for it which is kind of what you're talking about in which is to elevate one outside of yourself, to lose yourself, to be in contact with other things beyond your ego  i think it can be done and i think unfortunately, because of the legal status that we've had for a long time, the rituals and the practice around that have not had a chance to be developed or communicated  actually, trying to find this information was extremely hard  there was one book that i did find eventually from a guy who was doing lsd experiments while they were still legal and was able to accumulate enough wisdom about it that that would be the one place i would point people to  i think that it is important that the context and expectations and the setting they call it that revolves around it is very important and i do believe that these can be extremely profound and powerful experiences for good  they can remain long after and  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    most people who understand this and don't abuse it understand that in fact that experience was not in the pill, it was not in the chemical  it was a real experience  unfortunately, there's so much other stuff circulating around the use of these drugs and the misuse of them that that kind of information is often very, very difficult to find  but i do think maybe we're seeing a moment now in the us where the second prohibition is being undone and at least pot will become legal and maybe we can return to revitalizing the traditions and the necessary settings around that  an expectation that not just pot or lsd, but even other synthetic drugs can be extremely powerful in removing the ordinary guards that we have  we have an ego for our purpose  we have all these things to keep us sane on a day to day functional, exactly  if you remove it completely, you can become dysfunctional, but if you remove it deliberately and with great care you can be opened up  i think it's that  i think there's an expertise there  i think there's a lot of other things that that if we have the freedom and the wisdom to not abuse it i think it can be extremely powerful  tim ferriss   do you recall the title of the book?  kevin kelly   this is    tim ferriss   or how people might search for it?  kevin kelly   yes  this is one of the many resources that i recommend in my book cool tools  cool tools is a big catalog of the possibilities  it has about 1500 different items  a lot of them are like hantels, pliers and the great cordless drill, but it's much more than that  i include things like, ""what if you wanted to have a psychedelic experience that was transformative? what do you do?"" i would recommend this book or there's lots of other things in it  i don't actually have the book right in front of me  i should  i think it's called   i don't remember   tim ferriss   it's ok   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin kelly   in the show notes we will list it as the right one and there's also a little, tiny book that came from england  it was a cartoon guide  they gave a street, an unjudgmental view of all the different drugs there were and what each one did and didn't and what the plus and minuses are without recommending or forbidding them  it was just saying, ""this is what it is "" that information also believe it or not, is really in short supply  it's like, ""what do you do with this and how does it work and tell me the facts  i don't need to hear a lecture "" either way like, ""wow, this is great or this is terrible, but just tell me what's going on"" as you know that kind of information sometimes is in extremely short supply   tim ferriss   it's very difficult to find information that isn't politicized, inaccurate or like you said, so shrouded in either fear or irrational optimism that it's almost intelligible and certainly, generally useless  we'll put those books in the show notes for people  i want to come back to one of the things you said far, far earlier and that was related to the pieces that you tried to give away that eventually wouldn't die and came back  were there any common threads, any patterns in those pieces that you can pick out as being a uniquely, kevin kelly theme, for lack of a better term?  kevin kelly   yeah, one of the things that i discovered in my six months of trying to live as if i was going to die in six months because as i was coming close to that date, which happened to be halloween, october 31st, it was i kept cutting off my future  i may be like you  i tend to live in the future much more than the past  i'm always imagining  i'm saving this for someday when i'm going to do this  i'm looking forward  i'm going to do this here  i was very much in the future and then suddenly that future was being cut down day by day  i was thinking, ""why am i taking pictures? i'm not taking photographs because i'm not going to be here in another two months "" there was all these things that i'm cutting out and as i was cutting them out,  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    i had this realization, which was the thing i took away from this thing, which is that i was becoming less human  that to be fully human we have to have a future  we have to look forward to the future  that is part of us is looking into the future  after i came out of the, i embraced that  i'm saying, ""well, that future forward facing that's what i do  that's what i want to do and that's what i write about it "" in thinking about the future, one of the things that   it's very hard because the paradox about the future is that there are lots of impossible things that happen all the time  if someone from 100 years from now would come back and tell us things, there's a lot of stuff we just not going to believe  it's just like that's crazy  just like if we went back 100 years and told them what was going on now they would say, ""that's just not going to happen "" we could even go back 20 years  i could go back 20 years and say, ""we're going to have google street views of all the cities of the world and we're going to have encyclopedias for free that's edited by anybody "" they would say, ""there's no way "" i would tell them, ""most of it's for free "" they were saying, ""there is no economic model in the world that would allow for that,"" and there isn't, but here it is  the dilemma is, is that any true forecast about the future is going to be dismissed  any future that is believable now is going to be wrong and so you're stuck in this thing of if people believe it, it's wrong and if they don't believe it, where does it get you? you're dismissed  there is this very fine line between saying something that is right on the edge of plausibility and at the same time, right on the edge of having a chance of being true  what i discovered that was helpful in trying to get away from the kind of assumptions that bind us to just extrapolate was to think laterally, was to go sideways  one thing just take whatever it was that everybody knew and say, ""well, what if that wasn't true?"" tim ferriss   what would be a good example of that or an example?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin kelly   everyone says, ""moore's law will continue "" what if moore's law didn't continue? what would that mean? what would happen?  tim ferriss   maybe i could say for the audience, but i'll just say even to remind me, moore's law is   what is it? every 18 months the size and cost of technology will decrease by 50 , something along those lines?  kevin kelly   let's say even more simply   tim ferriss   oh no, there's speed involved as well   kevin kelly   right  moore law it does say that, but let's say something right now we live in a world where every year the technology is better and cheaper  what if that wasn't true?  tim ferriss   right, got it   kevin kelly   what if every year starting a couple years from now stuff was better, but more expensive? that's a completely different world  everyone assumes that things are going to get better and cheaper, but what if that wasn't true? you can take assumption, again that's something that's no one's really examining like one of the things i write about is the fact that we're going to have a population implosion globally  that the global population will drastically reduce in 100 years from now we'll have population, far, far less than we have right now   tim ferriss   all right, i have to bite at that  i thought a lot about this in what they call the malthusian dilemmas  is that going to be you think pandemic related, nuclear weapon related, all of the above?  kevin kelly   none of those   tim ferriss   none of those?  kevin kelly   no   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   ""ai"" coming into the rise of the machines, no?  kevin kelly   no  it's just pure demographics  if you look at the current trends in fertility rates in all the developed countries everywhere, except for the us, they are already either below replacement level  replacement level means that you are just sustaining the population just replaces itself  if it's below it means that there is getting less and less so japan, europe, they're all below replacement  the us is an exception because of only because of immigration  we need more people coming  otherwise, we would be there and this would not be any news to anybody  the real news is that people would point to developing world, but mexico is now aging faster than the us  china is aging faster because of their one child policy  of course, japan is completely   they are way under water completely  even the one exception is sub sahara africa and there's debate right now about how fast or whether they're slowing down, but generally around the world, south america, the rest of asia, the rate of fertility continues to drop and here's the thing is that the demographic transition that is happening everywhere where people become urban  every forecast shows the urbanity, the citification of the population continuing and i can't think of any counter force to stop this huge migration at the scale that we're seeing into the city and as that happens, the birth rates drop down  even in places like singapore or other places where they have taken very, very active countermeasures of cash for having kids, day care forever, bonuses, none of these work in terms of actually trying to raise fertility levels  you have to understand that to go above replacement level the average woman has to have 2 1 kids  well, that means there has to be tons and tons of women who have three or four kids to make up for those  how many people do you know with that many kids living in cities? there's not enough of them  this is a projection  some of these are un projections  they have three  they have a low, high and medium  the low one is not  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    good news because there's not a large cultural counterforce for women to have three  a lot, a very high percentage of the population to have three or four kids in a modern world and that's why the population continues to decrease every year  tim ferriss   this is perhaps a tangent, but one of the big debates in my head right now is to marry or not to marry, to have kids or not to have kids  i never thought those would even be questions in my mind and yet, here i am and now they are  what are your thoughts on having children? what type of people   this is very broad, but should have children or shouldn't have children, whichever way of answering is easier or how do you even think about that question?  kevin kelly   i think people who are privileged of which you are, should have children because you can bestow so many privileges and opportunities to your children and if the world is to be populated, why not populate it with children who have as many opportunities as possible? i also say from my own experience of growing up one of many kids and having   well, i have three kids  one of my other regrets in life is not having a fourth, but we just started a little bit too late and we were unable to have a fourth, but all my kids wished that we had had a fourth, too  i would say that it's a gift to your kids to have more than one  i know that from hanging out in china where so many kids grew up only children and really, really missed that  there is a total gift of the siblings, the brothers to each other, that is really very profound  there is also i know from my friends who have had lots of kids that there is a fair amount of teaching from the older to the younger and that's a lot of what they learn and that the curve of the amount of energy that you have to expend actually after three doesn't really matter in terms of the parents  i have one friend who has nine kids and i have another friend who has seven and basically, how do they do that? the older kids were helping to parent the younger kids  that's the only way that it really works, but that is actually, basically they have five parents instead of having two parents   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   right  it's very traditional in a way, traditional meaning reaching back thousands or tens of thousands of years   kevin kelly   it is  of course, in that the old days you may have had 12 born, but they rarely had 12 kids survive so that actually is a very recent   i mean it's like the 1800s onward  i hang out with the amish a lot and they still have these very large families and they all survived so they have in some senses an unnatural expansion  one of my predictions, again going back to the assumptions, one of my predictions is that in america in 100 years from now there will be   the complete countryside is run by the amish  the amish take over the entire countryside because they never sell land  they have eight kids and then there's all these people living in the city and it's like everybody's happy  you drive out to the amish lands and it's just fantastic  they are very happy doing their thing and running the farms  i have been predicting for years that the amish would come and start buying upstate new york and that's exactly what they're doing right now   tim ferriss   why do you spend so much time with the amish? this is news to me, but very interesting and how long has that been going on?  kevin kelly   for a while  by the way    tim ferriss   does your beard have anything, is there any relation to the amish?  kevin kelly   i had the beard before my interest in the amish  i'm going to show you some pictures when i was 19 years old  i have an amish beard, which means i have a beard without a mustache  the reason why the amish don't have mustaches is that it was at the time that they were adopting their dress code, the mustache was all military men had mustaches and so they were very anti military  they refused to serve in armies  they don't even vote  it was their rejection of the military by shaving off their mustache   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    i hang out with the amish because their adoption of technology seems to us totally crazy because first of all, they're not lettites  they're complete hackers  they love hacking technology  they have something called ""amish electricity,"" which is basically pneumatics  a lot of these farms had a big diesel   they don't have electricity, but they have a big diesel generator in the barn that pumps up this compressor that sends highpressure air tubes down tubing into their barn into their homes and so they have converted their sewing machine, washing machine to nomadic  tim ferriss   seems like a bit of a side step of the word of god?  kevin kelly   exactly  they'll have horse drawn buggies and horse drawn farm implements and the horses will be pulling this dieselgenerated combine and you're thinking, ""what are they doing?"" in fact, if you look at our own lives and i have done this many times, i can ask you tim or you can ask me, there will be some weird thing like, ""we don't have tv in our house, but i've got internet "" it's like, ""what is that about?"" we all have these things, but here's the difference is that the amish do it collectively  they are very selective  they are selecting their technology collectively as a group and secondly, because they're doing it collectively they have to articulate what the criteria is  a lot of us are adopting, ""we try this, we try that "" we don't have any logic or reason or theory or framework for why we're doing this stuff  it's just a parade of stuff, but the amish have very particular criteria and their criterion is there are two things that they're looking for  the main thing they want to do, the main reason why they have all these restrictions like horse and buggy and all of this stuff is that they want to have these communities, very strong communities  they noticed that if you have a car that you'll drive out and shop somewhere out of the community or you go to church somewhere out of the community, but if you have a horse and buggy you can go only 15 miles and so everything has to happen   your entire life, you have to support the community  you have the community  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    within 15 miles  you have to visit the sick and you have to shop locally so you're shopping with your neighbors  when a new technology comes along they say, ""will this strengthen our local community or send us out?"" the second thing that they're looking at is with families  the goal of the typical amish man or woman is to have every single meal with their children for every meal of their lives until they leave home  they have breakfast and they have lunch and they have dinner so breakfast and lunch is they go to a one room schoolhouse and they pedal back for lunch that their parents had with them  that means that the business is ideally in their backyard  they have a lot of shops and stuff  if they're not a farmer and they have a backyard shop, which actually has to be cleanish because it is in their backyard  well, it is in their backyard, so they really want to ensure that   many of them have metalworking shops which they really try to keep non toxic and work because it's in their backyard  that means that they can come home for lunch  they have breakfast and lunch so they're on the premise and they have every single meal with their children until they leave  they say, ""will this technology allow us to do that? will it help us do that or will it work against that?"" right now, they have been deciding whether to accept cell phones or not, even though they don't have land line phones  basically, some of them are going to accept cell phones and they do that by there's always some early amish adopter who's trying things and they say, ""ok ivan  bishop says you can  "" he has to get permission  he says, ""you can try this, but we're watching you  we're going to see what effect this has on your family, on your community  you have to be ready to give it up at any time we say that it's not working,"" and they do this on a parish by parish  it's very de centralized  they try it out  always trying out new technologies and they're always looking to see, ""does this strengthen the families? does this strengthen the communities? if not, we don't want it ""  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   i have two questions  the first is since you're normally as i understand it based on the west coast in northern california, how do you get out to the amish or is there a separate community closer by? secondly, what have you incorporated into your own life or your own family that originated from the amish?  kevin kelly   yeah  i don't get to see them as often as i want it actually, when i go east i have some contacts that i will exercise and i try to get to stay overnight and go to church in a buggy or something   tim ferriss   this is pennsylvania?  kevin kelly   actually, pennsylvania is the heart of it, but actually there are more communities in ohio, where my brother lives, iowa, there's a lot more happening in new york  the pennsylvania are the ground zero, but in fact there are bigger, more extensive communities outside of pennsylvania   tim ferriss   i didn't realize that  the amish diaspora   kevin kelly   it is  i'm saying they literally are just buying up farmland  they're expanding  they're constantly expanding  they have a very small attrition rate, very large families  they all are buying  basically, they're buying farms and stuff for their children and they never sell  they also don't even move into areas as a     they have a minimum number of families that need to move in at once  what did i learn from them? one of the things that we've had, particularly when we had younger kids was technological sabbaticals or sabbaths i should say  i've now seen other families who aren't even religious adopt that same thing which is once a week you take a break from either you can define it however you want, the screen or the keyboard or connectivity or something and you step back  you do that not because it's terrible or poison, but because it's so good  there's lots of people who are like they're going to drop out from twitter  they're kind of like, ""this is like a toxin  i need  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    to detox "" i think that's entirely long way to think about it is you want to take breaks from this not because they're toxic, but because they are so good  it's like you want to step back so that you can re enter it and with a renewed perspective, with a renewed appreciation, with having spent time looking at it in a different way  i think that kind of rhythm of having sabbaths and then yearly vacations, retreats  then every seven years you take a true sabbatical, i think that kind of rhythmic disconnection or sabbath i think is very powerful, something that works very well and was something that we had in our family  tim ferriss   i take saturdays off as it turns out as my screen less day  i really try to make that a weekly occurrence and it's incredible the effect that it has, this galvanizing effect of just a mere 24 hours, not even that if you just consider the waking hours  every seven years a vacation or sabbatical of how long in your case or your family's case?  kevin kelly   yeah  partly because my wife actually is granted a sabbatical from the company she works for which is genentech  it was one of the few companies that actually have an official sabbatical for all their researchers at least and it's very meager  it's six weeks  of course, a six weeks sabbatical is basically a european annual vacation  for an american    tim ferriss   right  it's three years   kevin kelly   that's a big thing  we're doing something different  this year we're taking one and we're going to camp in national parks for one month of it and then the other two weeks we'll go to asia, but we haven't been to a lot of the national parks  i'm going to do a different kind of project that i haven't done before and we'll do some car camping  we haven't really done a big road trip like that so it's all new for us   tim ferriss   what is the longest in the last few years that you've gone without checking email?  kevin kelly   oh, probably two weeks and in china   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   how do you manage that?  kevin kelly   well, it was not very easy  i was unable to pick it up because china was blocking google   tim ferriss   makes it more challenging   kevin kelly   i was in some remote places and so even the connection was hard, but it was like they weren't letting me get it  i'm not a mobile person  my first smartphone was the iphone 5 and i m still not using it properly  i use it for phone calls   tim ferriss   yeah  i don't use my iphone as an input device either  it drives me nuts   kevin kelly   i can't type  when i travel i like to leave everything  i spend a lot of my time sitting in front of a computer  i'm like the zen  walk walk, sit sit, don't wobble  i'm here  i'm really online  then when i leave this studio i don't want to be connected at all and i won't be and i'm not checking email  i'm not checking this other stuff and i can go days, typically i'll go days without checking even in the us if i'm traveling  if i'm overseas i will go probably three or four days before i get the email  that's pretty typical   tim ferriss   let me shift gears just a little bit  i'm looking at longnow org  i recommend everybody take a look at it, long now foundation  humans are generally i would say pretty bad at thinking long term, certainly when it comes to habit change, very, very high failure rate with long term incentives  ""you're going to get diabetes in 20 years,"" for instance, as opposed to ""you'll have more sex if you have a six pack when it comes to diet "" at the long now foundation i just want to read a few things on this website for people  ""the long now foundation is established in 1996,"" written as 01996, ""to creatively foster long term thinking and responsibility in the framework of the next 10,000 years ago "" then you have  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    10,000 year clock, which is a monument scale, multi millennial all mechanical clock  it's an icon to long term thinking  the rosetta project, building an archive of all documented human languages  long bets, featured bet is here, warren buffett, prot g  partners, llc  ""public arena for enjoyable, competitive predictions of interest to society with philanthropic money at stake,"" and then ""revive and restore,"" which is bringing extinct species back to life  there is a lot here  can you explain to people because i have greatly enjoyed many of the seminars and speeches of the long now foundation  i'm a supporter  i suppose i've even spoken there on stage and love the email synopses that stewart sends out  what is the function of the long now foundation and what is the value? kevin kelly   the long now foundation is reactive  it's reacting to the very inherent, short term bias that our society, particularly this technological society, particularly say the silicon valley exhibits, which is often a focus on the next quarter, the next two quarters, the next year, results needing to be immediate, instant satisfaction, if something is not on netflix streaming, we don't even wait for the dvd  it's this fairly very fast paced, short term thinking and also, somewhat blinded by the fact that we don't have a lot of sense of history either that we're ignorant about what's happened in the past  the term ""the long now"" came from brian eno who noticed that we have a very short now, which is the next five minutes and the last five minutes  the long now is an attempt to expand that so that we, as a society and as individuals, would try to think about things at a generational or civilizational scale  how about working on something that might take longer than your own lifetime to accomplish? you start something now that maybe make it so that it might take   like the cathedrals of old, what if we were trying to make something that might need 25 years to accomplish? how can we do that? we're trying to encourage people to think in that perspective, to take that perspective and then to maybe move in that direction  we're not necessarily saying we have to have the asimov  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    foundation where we have to have a master plan for the next 100 years and we're going to plan out the future  no, we're agnostic about what it is that people make or do  we're just saying that it would benefit thinking about the longterm  i've often heard some people who advised to counseling to individuals about thinking about the long term in your own life, even though you might want to act locally and be spontaneous, but you do want to keep in mind the fact that you'll be around for a while, whether it's putting some savings away or working on a skill that might take some time, more than the six months or a year to acquire or whatever it is that you can have both perspectives  we're not attempting to get rid of the need for people to survive, the need for companies to have a profit this year  we're saying there can be additional perspectives in addition to that where we say we commit to a program, a science research where it's pure science and the results of this say in mathematics is one of the most profound things that we can invest in, even though most of the things in the beginning seem to be non utilitarian  they don't have any purpose, but we know from our own history that in 20 years they'll pay off in some way or other  being able to construct a society so that we can allow the rewards of long term investment, long term thinking, long term perspective that would make us a better civilization  tim ferriss   i love the long now foundation  i encourage everybody to check it out, longnow org   tim ferriss   i'd love to perhaps jump into some rapid fire questions, and they don't have to even be rapid   kevin kelly   just some fire questions   tim ferriss   just some fire questions  the questions will be rapid  the answers can be as short or as long as you'd like  what book or  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    books do you gift or have gifted the most to other people outside of your own books? kevin kelly   there is a short graphic novel by daniel pink called bunko, and it's career counsel advice  it's aimed at young people  it's a graphic novel  it's a cartoon, basically, and it's aimed at young people as trying to teach them how to become indispensable  i've given that away to young people because it's, for me, the best summary of     again, it's not how to become successful  it's how to become indispensable, too   tim ferriss   that's right  it's adventures of johnny bunko, or something like that  i have that in my bookshelf back in san francisco, in fact   kevin kelly   if you know a young person who is just starting out, hand them that book  it's very easy for them to read  again, it's graphic novel  it's not threatening  it's fun  it'll give this five great principles for starting out and helping them go orient themselves as they start working, in the working life   tim ferriss   for someone who's facing a lot of the same questions let s just say, you have graduates asking the  what should i do? why am i here? what am i good at?  if we fast forward to say, for the sake of argument, mid 30s, people in middle age hitting that particular point, are there any books that you would recommend they read?  kevin kelly   there is a book that i'm recommending by cal newport  it's called so good they can't ignore you  this changed my mind because i bought into the new age california dogma of follow your bliss, one will follow  he makes a really good argument and convinced me that's actually not very good advice, that what you really want to do is to master something and to use your mastering of something as a way to get to your passion  if you start with just passion, it's paralyzing because     and i know  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    this from my own kids  they're 18  they literally don't know what they're passionate about  some people are lucky enough to know, and a lot of people aren't  this is a book for people who don't really know what they're really excellent at, don't really know what they're passionate about  his premise is that you master something, almost anything at all, just something you master, and you use that mastery to move you into a place where you can begin to have passion, and that you keep recycling that the way you find your passion is through mastery rather than the other way around, which is people think that they're going to get their mastery through passion  i believe that former     that passion would lead to mastery, but after thinking about it, looking at his examples and his argument, i'm pretty sure that, at least, for most people, you can get to your passion through mastery  tim ferriss   that would also give you a currency or a lever to use in getting to that point  do you have a favorite fiction book?  kevin kelly   yes   tim ferriss   i usually don't get one answer  this is great   kevin kelly   shantaram  it might take me a while to explain this, but it's author who wrote one book because this is very autobiographical  the premise of the book and the author's life seems completely incredulous and almost hollywood ish, but what you get from it and where it's set, it's set in india, it's set in the slums of india, and you get an incredibly vivid, immersive,  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    deep, and in some ways uplifting view of india and the underworld in india, into that part of asia  the main protagonist is this very interesting zen criminal  he's sort of a coyote trickster blend of someone who is     he does bad things, but at the same time, he's sorry about it, and he has a cosmic perspective  it's very, very unusual, but it's a long book  i actually recommend that if people are going to try this, you actually to get the audible version and listen to  it runs on and on, but it'd be one of those books that you wish will never end  i'll just tell you the beginning of it, which is that, and this is the true part, which is that the guy, the author became a bank robber in new zealand  he was hooked on drugs, started robbing banks, was eventually caught, and escaped from prison  he made his way to the slums of india, where because he had a medical kit, he was treated as a doctor  got involved and hooked on drugs in india  got involved with the mafia  was put to prison, tortured, left, abandoned  nobody knew he was even in there  started writing a book  hereafter, he wrote his book, they ripped it up, destroyed it  he was recruited, found a guru, an afghani, was recruited in   was fighting there because entire company was wiped out  that s just the beginning  that's like the first day  tim ferriss   it's really interesting that you would bring up shantaram for those people who haven't heard josh waitzkin  i also had him on this podcast  josh was the basis for searching for bobby fisher, the book and the movie  world class chess player  also very deep, soulful guy, and this is one of his favorite books as well  you would love josh  sometime, i will have to put you guys in touch, but any favorite documentaries?  kevin kelly   now you've asked the wrong question because i have a cycle of true films, for the past 10 years  i have reviewed the best  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    documentaries, and i actually have a book called true films, which is the 200 best documentaries that you should see before you die  tim ferriss   oh my god! no kidding  you have no idea how timely this is  it's t r u e films?  kevin kelly   yeah  true films  there are a couple of films that i would say have served universal appreciation  they may have a rating of 100 on rotten tomatoes or something  the one documentary that i think everybody i know have seen has love is man on wire   tim ferriss   that's such a good movie  oh my god! yeah   kevin kelly   it's just transcendent  it's just a beautiful movie  it's based on fact that this guy basically he's going to walk the twin towers  the moment was he was a 14 year old kid in france, was at a dentist's office looking at a magazine, and he's hold     there were had the plans to build this twin tower new york  he saw those two twin towers, and he said, ""i need to walk between them "" he didn't know how to tight walk  the towers had not been built  he was already planning this thing  he was filming himself the whole way  he does it, and how he does it is amazing  another great documentary that i love because it's very unusual among documentaries and that it films the villain side of the whole thing as well, which is king of kong   tim ferriss   this has been recommended to me  i still have not seen this movie   kevin kelly   king of kong is about a guy who becomes the video game, arcade game king of kong  he becomes the champion, but he is basically competing against this cabal of people who are trying  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    to subvert him and are doing all kinds of really terrible things to stop him, which was all on film  here's this really midwestern, really lovable guy, and you're rooting for him all the time while these really sleazy guys are trying to take him down  it's just fantastic  tim ferriss   i have to watch that   kevin kelly   that's the second one  the third one is when   but it's called state of mind  it's about the spectacles in north korea, which these two filmmakers had access to  they followed several different young athletes who were practicing for this spectacle, and these spectacles, of course, where there's these people are pixels  they have this huge stadium size things, and they're like little robots  they're cogs in this machine, which is perfect  you can imagine a picture that's made up of pixels, but every pixel is actually a little boy or girl holding up a card, colored cards in sequence so these things move, which means that there's not a pixel missing  it means that nobody's sick  you're not allowed to be sick  you can't make a mistake at all, and it's getting inside of north korea, which turns out to be a nationwide cult  i think that in 50 years when they're gone, nobody will believe that, that was impossible, and this documentary will be here saying like, ""no, no, no  there really was a nationwide cult, and they really did believe this "" it really is amazing just to see what's going on there   tim ferriss   i know what i'm doing for the next few days, next few evenings   kevin kelly   i can't go on unfortunately because i have a lot of them, but go to the true films   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   true films   kevin kelly   i only review ones that are great, so i don't do     i'm just saying these are fantastic   tim ferriss   man, i've been looking for this  i cannot believe that i'm only learning this now  i'm embarrassed about that  when you think of the word or hear the word successful, who's the first person who comes to mind?  kevin kelly   jesus   tim ferriss   why would you say that?  kevin kelly   there aren't that many people who've left their mark on as many people in the world as he has  i think what he was up to, what he was doing is vastly been twisted, misunderstood, whatever word you want, but nonetheless, what's remarkable is     and here's a guy who didn't write anything  i think success is also overrated   tim ferriss   i'd love for you to elaborate on that   kevin kelly   greatness is overrated  i mentioned big numbers, but it's more of the impact that they had on people's lives  i think we tend to have an image of success that's so much been skewed by our current media, just like our sense of beauty of women  in terms of all possibilities, it's in a very small, narrow, define     ritualistic in a certain sense  i think our idea of success is often today it means you're somebody who has a lot of money, or who has a lot of fame, or who has some of these other trappings, which we had assigned, but i think can be successful by being true to, and being the most 'you' that you could possibly be   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    i think that what's i think of as when you think of jesus, whether you take him as a historical character or anything beyond, was about     he certainly wasn't imitating anybody, let me put it that way  i think that's the great temptation that people have is they want to be someone else, which is basically they want to be in someone else's movie  they want to be the best rock star, and there's so many of those already that you can only wind up imitating somebody in that slot  i think to me the success is like you make your own slot  you have a new slot that didn't exist before  i think that's of course what jesus and many others were doing, but they were making a new slot  that's really hard to do, but i think that's what i chalk up as success is you made a new slot  tim ferriss   what is your new slot? you knew that was coming   kevin kelly   who says i'm successful?  tim ferriss   i'm not  i'm trying to not make any assumptions here  or what would be your slot?  kevin kelly   my slot would be kevin kelly  that's the whole thing  it's not going to be a career or you would really ideally be something that would     you had no imitators  you would be who you are, and that is success actually in some sense is you didn't imitate anybody, no one else imitated you afterwards  in a certain sense you have, if you become an adjective, that's a good sign, right?  tim ferriss   mm hmm (affirmative)   kevin kelly   i think success is actually you make your own path  if they're calling you a successful entrepreneur, then to me that's not the best kind of success   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   because you're being confined to that category   kevin kelly   you're in a category   tim ferriss   if you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?  kevin kelly   i could sing   tim ferriss   aha! you'd like to sing   kevin kelly   yeah  i seem to be unable to carry a tune  i can't remember when my wife can hear something once, she can just sing it back later  i can hear the same song or have heard the same song and i couldn't tell you three notes of it  i'm sure because i'm a tim ferriss fan, i'm sure i could train myself to   that  i know i could, but i guess i haven't, and it would be something that i have to really work at and i haven't, but i have trouble carrying a tune, staying in tune, remembering a tune  i love music, and that i appreciate it, but in terms of actually singing and or play     i don't play an instrument, so maybe i would say if it was a little easier for me, that would be something nice   tim ferriss   have you take lessons or attempted to take lessons?  kevin kelly   no   tim ferriss   i got it  just in the spirit of trade  i've recently started exploring hand drumming with jim bass and different types of drums  if anyone out there can get me a pen art hang, i would really love to hear from you  those of you that     won't mean nothing to most people who are hearing this, the research that has peaked my curiosity most recently, and, of course, you don't want to run out and just start swallowing these things, but there's a common anti epilepsy drug called the valproate, which apparently has some implications for opening a window for  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    achieving perfect pitch in mature adults  very fascinating stuff  if i do any experiments with that, i will certainly report back  kevin kelly   now that you've talked about it, not the drug part, but i did, i remember i did take one class     you mentioned drums  i took a one class at an adult summer camp, which i highly recommended  if your kids go to camp, you should go with them, and that was a steel drum course  i loved that  like you, i think if i did take up an instrument, it would be drums of some sort because that, i seem to respond to it, and i did pretty good for the intro course on steel drumming   tim ferriss   i find percussion to be so primal  it just satisfied some type of need that probably predates verbal communication even  certainly written notes   kevin kelly   i think it's your inner cave man that's responding   tim ferriss   are there any particular, let's just say in the first two hours of your day, any particular morning rituals or habits you have that when performed consistently, you find produce better days for you  i'm leaving better days undefined on purpose, but i love studying mornings and or what people do when they wake up  what time do you wake up? are there any particular habitual rituals that you find contribute to better days?  kevin kelly   i'm a very good sleeper  i don't sleep a lot  these days, i get up at 7 30 and i have some rituals, but i don't vary them enough maybe to know whether they are     i'm not morning person to begin with   tim ferriss   you're not a morning person  the fact that you don't vary them is perfect   kevin kelly   i know, but i don't necessarily optimize it in any way, or i can't tell which is better, but for better or worse, one of the first  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    things i do is i read the paper version of the new york times  it's what i call a guilty pleasure  i don't know whether that makes me better at anything else i do, but i don't drink coffee or anything  it's a ritual, and when i'm not here, i don't read it, so it's like i don't miss it  i'm curious, but if i'm here, it's like i got to do it  it's weird  tim ferriss   is that immediately after waking you read the paper, or is there anything you do?  kevin kelly   just about  in my pajamas, i walk out to the front gate, and i pick it up, and i read it  i don't read all of it  i just go through, and i usually don't even read the news part  i read the slower stuff  i'm not sure why  now that you're asking, and that's it  that s the entire ritual  i don't have the same thing for breakfast or anything like that  it's just that morning hit   tim ferriss   do you do anything throughout your day, regularly? maybe it's before bed or anything else that most other people probably don't do   kevin kelly   that's a good question  no   tim ferriss   really?  kevin kelly   i have no special sauce   tim ferriss   but you're very consistent  your days seem to be     don't vary very well  at least that, in and of itself, might be something that a lot of people don't   kevin kelly   let's pick up two different things  while i'm here in the studio, have a lot of control over my time  what i do during the day is greatly varied though  i do a lot of things for short amount of times  i'll go into my workshop  i'll read, actually read books, sit down and read books during the middle of the day  i'll go out  i'll do a hike and bring my camera almost every day   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    maybe that is something that most people don't do is probably they probably aren't taking pictures with their camera every day  tim ferriss   more reading books in the middle of the day for them i think  kevin kelly   maybe that's true, i guess   tim ferriss   how do you choose your books? that's a paradox of choice problem for a lot of people   kevin kelly   it is  it's like, what are you going to listen to next in music  the music becomes free, and everybody has all the music in the world, but deciding what you're going to listen to becomes the thing you pay for  that's been my prediction about amazon is they will soon going to have any book you want for free  amazon prime, digital version of it  you can have it whenever you want, but you'll pay for us for the recommendations  tim ferriss   that's a great point   kevin kelly   i have a network of friends, and i listen to lots of podcasts  i get it from all over the place  like probably you are at this point, i long ago decided that in terms of the greater scheme of things, the cost of books are really cheap, and if i wanted a book, i would buy it  the result is that i'm right now speaking in a two story high library of books that i have  i don't do the same with digital books because i finally figured out that if i purchase it, a book before i'm reading it, it's not going anywhere  it's just sitting there  i shouldn't really purchase a digital book until five seconds before i'm going to read it   tim ferriss   i have exactly the opposite habit   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin kelly   it's just there  the whole point of kindle is that you don't have to have it until you need it  on the digital books, i don't buy anything until i'm seconds away from reading it, then i'll get it, but the paper books, i was near to the point of actually digitizing and getting rid of all my paper books  i was that close about five years ago, but then i had an epiphany  i went to private library, and i realized that books were never as cheap as they are today  they never will be as cheap, and that there's some power about having these things in paper always available, no batteries, never obsolete, and that if you made a library now, you would never be able to make some of these libraries in 50 years, so i decided to keep and to cultivate this paper library as something that was going to be powerful in the future   tim ferriss   i like that  or at least i can use it as justification for keeping a lot of paper books around   kevin kelly   i get tips for books from podcasts, from blogs, from friends, from amazon recommendations, anywhere, and whenever i hear someone recommend a book, i'll go and check it out, and then i'm fairly free in buying it, but which means i read a lot of really mediocre books   tim ferriss   what?  kevin kelly   that's part of my job in cool tools  the book that we were just talking about, which is this catalog of possibility for the selfpublished that has, oh i don t know, 15 hundred  maybe there's couple hundred books that are recommended, but i probably read thousands and thousands and thousands of books in order to select those  i see part of my job reading through, and i read a lot of how to books  most of the books i'm reading is nonfiction  a lot of the  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    easy, instructional stuff on how to build a stonewall, how to do origami, how to send a cell, microcell to space, whatever it is, it doesn't matter  i'll look at it, and i've seen tens of thousands of them, 50 thousand how to books over my lifetime  i can spot a really good one, but still i'll read through the other ones so that someone else doesn't have to and i can recommend the same, ""this is the best book on building a tiny house if you want to build a tiny house "" tim ferriss   when you read these books on origami or stonewall, do you follow through and attempt these projects, or are you evaluating it purely based on your amassed experience of reading lots of these types of instructional books?  kevin kelly   no  actually, maybe one of the other things that i don't do every day, but one of the things i do in general that maybe everyone else is not doing is that i have thousand hobbies  i dabble in things  i have built stonewalls, more than one  i have done origami  i have made beer  i have made wine  whatever it is, i've tried to do these things in my life, and i continue to try and do that  i have homeschooled my son  as much as possible, this is     i was telling you before about my day  it's irregular in the sense that i'm here and i have things, but i'm doing new things, and i'm reading new things all the time  when i'm outside, i ll make a go kart or a wall  do something that i haven't done before  that's the basis for helping decide about these books  i don't have to be an expert in them, but i can know enough to tell whether or not the information they're telling me is useful   tim ferriss   what odd project over the last year has been the most fun? let's start there, for you   kevin kelly   just the last couple of months, i finally built myself a real workshop  i wish i could show it to you because one of the cool  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    things that i did was if you go on to u line or somewhere, this container, they have these racks of bins  i've filled an entire wall of hundreds and hundreds of bins so i can organize stuff  i'm a big fan of adam savage  he has a principle for his workshops called first order access, which basically means that you don't want to store things behind anything  everything has to be at the first level so you can look and see it  it has to be within reach  he says you have to be able to see everything that you have and it's accessible  you don't want things hidden behind other things  that s part of what i was doing with this workshop is this first order access  it's tremendously powerful  the few days or the weeks i've had working, and it just transforms everything  i had the same problem with my books for many, many years  i had books like multiple different bookshelves in the house  i had them in boxes  i had them this and that  moving everything to one location, to a library where there was two stories, i could see all my books, just transformed them and made it really useful because i could find them  just really go and reach for them  the same thing was i'm finally bringing that to my tools, which is that you want to have things plugged in, ready to go, labeled, organized, first order access, and it can make simple jobs really simple instead of the hours of looking for something  alsotim ferriss   like gathering all the tools   kevin kelly   gathering all the tools and also   tim ferriss   just like cooking  it's just like cooking  it's like having a manual, random access memory, right?  kevin kelly   right   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   you have your mise en place right in front of you   kevin kelly   you know the tools are   tim ferriss   that's very cool  if there were one object, manual project, building something, do you think every human should have the experience of doing, what would that be?  kevin kelly   that's very easy  you need to build your own house, your own shelter  it's not that hard to do, believe me  actually, i built my own house   tim ferriss   your house is amazing   kevin kelly   not this house  i built one from cutting down the logs, cutting down the trees in upstate new york, and doing the stone hearth  unfortunately, i don't recommend this, maybe like 2 by 4s from trees  you don't want to do that because it's a pain  standard lumber is very good  if those things are off a little quarter of an inch as they are with rough sewn lumbers, it's a mess  nonetheless, a large portion of people in the world have made their own homes, adobe, rammed earth, bamboo, whatever it is  going back to what we originally started off with, even if you don't wind up living in it, it's empowering to know that you can do it, and if you do wind up living in it, i have a friend, lloyd conn, who built his magnificent place in balinese that he built with salvaged material from scratch over the many years  it gives you the power to alter it  i believe that your house should be an extension of you, that really is another projection  it's another way of, and also, going back to what we're talking about, is just another way to discover who you are and discover what you're good at because a welldesigned house should really reflect you  what i've discovered,  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    lot of people designed houses, and they have this imaginary fantasy idea about themselves and what they're going to do  whatever it is, they're going to have a swimming pool  they're never going to use a swimming pool  whatever it is  very few people actually have a very good sense of who they are and what they're going to use something for, but if you really study yourself and really are honest and designed something that space can help you become successful in the sense of making a slot for you, making your own slot  it's both a by product of who you are, and also can help you become who you are  it works both ways  tim ferriss   i like that  you're not just finding yourself  you're creating yourself   kevin kelly   this is a larger philosophical question, but this is something i talk about a lot  in a very high dimensional space, which means space of many pending possibilities, the act of finding and the act of creating are identical  there's no difference between discovering something and inventing something  we could say that philosophically, benjamin franklin invented electricity  we could say that christopher columbus invented america  we could say that discovery and invention are the same, so that discovering yourself and inventing yourself is really the same things that bring about that process  you have to do both at once   tim ferriss   i really enjoyed that  last question  if you could give your     let's say, you can pick the age, either 15 or 20 year old self, one or a few pieces of advice, what would they be?  kevin kelly   you don't have to do everything yourself  you can hire people to do stuff  i wish i had known that when i was younger  i wish that i had, when i was 20 working for whole earth catalog, i  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    wish i had known that i could have hired a programmer to do something  i could have hired someone  it took me a long time to understand that  then recently, i'd been really big on it, hiring people through elance  because i came from a little bit of a do it yourself     i made a nature museum when i was 12  i had a chemistry lab that i built myself, building that stuff  i could buy any glassware, but i had a whole chemistry lab  i had nature museums  i did all the stuff, and i did it myself, and then of course moving into the whole earth catalog, which is a do ityourself thing, i really was     i just talked about building my own house  now, i will hire professionals to work  it just took me a long time to realize that there's something about     being able to pay professionals to do what they do really well is not a weakness  it helps them  i'm happy  they're happy  we're all happy  i can do a lot more  there's certainly a pleasure in doing things yourself and dabbling in it, but there's also this other thing, which i didn't realize, which is there's this leverage that you get by hiring people who are really good, paying them fairly, working with them to amplify what it is that you want to do  i wish i knew that when i was younger  tim ferriss   that's a fantastic answer  you have, if i remember correctly, an assistant and a researcher  is that still true?  kevin kelly   yes, one and the same person   tim ferriss   they are the same  i thought that at one point, you had believed that you needed those people to be two separate people but you   kevin kelly   here's what i was saying was that it's very unusual to find one person who can do both of those tasks  both of those tasks are often not found on the same person because there's the hunting,  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    the researching  there's a hunter aspect to research that's often found in a certain personality, and then they're the kind the admin  it's more nurturing, kind of making sure things, gardening a little bit  it's often rare to find someone who can do both, but it's possible  tim ferriss   was it luck that you happened upon this particular individual that you work with now? or did you have a method for     ? was there a particular approach    kevin kelly   i found that the place where i found   over the 14 years, i've had two, the place where i found that they're more likely than not to have a combination was librarians   tim ferriss   i love it   kevin kelly   we put out notices on the librarian mailing list and stuff   tim ferriss   i said last question  this will be the last question  is there any other thoughts or advice you'd like to leave with the listeners, and then where would you like people to find more from you, your writing, anywhere else   kevin kelly   i would say congratulations to the people who have listened to the podcast  i think podcast are these fantastic new medium  i'm spending a lot of time there  i think it's this really great  we're in the early days of where this will go  i'm really impressed by the power of this medium to teach and to inform  sometimes to entertain  again, i'm thankful to you, tim, for having me on and having the chance to gab here, but to the people who are listening, i think keep going  listen to more podcasts  try to go wide  i know tim mentions them here and there  take a chance  listen to some more  that's one thing i would say as far as finding out more about me, i lucked out with a very easy website  it's my initials, kk   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kk org  i have very public email for the past 25 years  you can find it very easily on my website if you want email directly  i have not outsourced that unlike other people that i know  my writings and books and whatnot are www kk org  cool tools is a book that i really believe that each of you out there should have  it's on paper  it's the best of the website, cool tools, which is me going on for 11 years now where we review every day, one great tool  they're only positive reviews  why waste your time on anything but the best? tools in the broadest sense of the word of things that are useful, whether it's elance, or a book on how to do psychedelics, or a book on how to build a workshop, or how to build a house, or how to hitchhike around the world  i and others recommend the best here with some great contexts  it's printed on paper, available on amazon  not so easily found in bookstores because it's huge  it's like 5 pounds weighs  it's really, really big  if you don't find 500 things you didn't know about but you wished you know about, like last year, i'll give you your money back  enjoy that  that said, cool tools or cool tools in amazon  tim ferriss   kevin, this has been a blast  it always is  every time we chat, i feel like we should chat more  hopefully, we'll get a chance to spend some more time together soon back in nor cal or somewhere else?  kevin kelly   nor cal? in china   tim ferriss   or in china  it's been a long time  i could get back   kevin kelly   i'm heading back to japan again, and i know that you have lots of roots in asia, but i go there to renew my sense of the future because they are     they're bulldozing the past as fast as they can and headed, racing into the future  i want to see what asia  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    has in store for us because mathematically, we don't count anymore  1 3 billion, whatever, the 3 billion asians and 300 million americans  what can you say? tim ferriss   study up, folks  specialization is for insects  i think that was a hind line   kevin kelly   hind line   tim ferriss   enjoy your time on this planet and look broadly like kevin said  kevin, thank you so much  i will talk to you soon, and have a wonderful day  i will talk to you soon   kevin kelly   thanks for having me, tim   tim ferriss   buh bye   kevin kelly   bye bye   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    "
92,96,96: Kevin Kelly ,"   hello, boys and girls, this is tim ferriss, and welcome to another episode of the tim ferriss show, where it is usually my job to deconstruct world class performers across all different areas and industries, whether they be military, chess, sports, entertainment, or otherwise, business, of course, being the obvious one  this time, it is a conversation between friends, and i am extremely excited to have kevin kelly back on the show  kevin kelly   i ve said this before   might be the real life, most interesting man in the world  i m not making up what i m about to read to you  he is  senior maverick  at wired magazine, which he cofounded in 1993  he also cofounded the all species foundation, a nonprofit aimed at cataloguing and identifying every living species on earth  in his spare time   of course, i m using that tongue in cheek   he writes bestselling books, many of them  cofounded the rosetta project, which is building an archive of all documented human languages  and serves on the board of the long now foundation  as part of the last, he s investigating how to revive and restore endangered or extinct species, including the wooly mammoth  that is not made up, folks  we touch on a lot of really fun stuff in this episode, and when kevin arrived at my house to record, i had certain plans  i asked him what he wanted to highlight or focus on, and we just decided to catch up as friends  so, this is very truly the type of conversation that led me, in the first place, many moons ago to ask,  why don t i record these and share these conversations?  because i have so much fun catching up with friends like kevin  this is about as close to a banter over drinks as you re going to get in my life, certainly, putting this out publicly  so, i hope you enjoy it  we touch on all sorts of things  stories about jeff bezos and his email management approach, favorite books, impactful books, tech literacy, and why there are  no vr experts,  which is very inspiring  there is a video that didn t make it into this interview, but kevin mentioned afterward, that i think is the history of japan in nine minutes that i highly recommend everybody checks out  we talk about the evolution of china, why he spent so much time  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    in china, artificial intelligence, network effects, virtual reality, gmo   we talk about everything  if you think i am the only big fan of kevin, well, of course that s not true  here is a little bit of praise for his most recent book, called the inevitable  these are real quotes  i ll truncate some of them, so here we go   anyone can claim to be a prophet, a fortune teller, or a futurist, and plenty of people do  what makes kevin kelly different is that he s right   it goes on and on  that s david pogue, who many of you will know  then we have,  kevin kelly s been predicting our technological future with uncanny prescience for years  now he gives us a glimpse of how the next three decades will unfold   that s ernest cline, author of ready player one  and then, also referring to the book the inevitable, marc andreessen, who i had on the podcast recently, cofounder of andreessen horowitz, technological icon, refers to it as  an automatic must read   so, i hope you enjoy this very informal and wide ranging conversation with none other than kevin kelly  if you want to listen to a longer conversation where i dig into his bio and learn all sorts of nuggets that even i didn t know, then you can check out fourhourworkweek com kevin  just go to fourhourworkweek com kevin and you can find previous conversations with him  enjoy  kevin, welcome back to the show  kevin kelly   it s always a pleasure, tim  it s so great to be here  it s a fantastic low horizontal space   tim ferriss   thank you  it s great to have you in my house for a change  i remember, still, the very first quantified self meet up at your place in pacifica with however many people it was   kevin kelly   there were 25 people who showed up, with a call to,  if you think you re quantifying yourself, come,  and tim was one of the people who arrived   tim ferriss   it was a broad spectrum of folks   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin kelly   it was  it was really good  we had no idea what to expect, gary wolf and i, probably eight or nine years ago  that was the very first meeting of the quantified self movement, and it was meeting in my studio in pacifica   tim ferriss   and where is quantified self now? what is the scope of that?  kevin kelly   there are meetings in almost 300 cities around the world, and we have an international conference once a year, so it s entered into the vocabulary  people talk about it, whether for or against it  there are, of course, tons and tons of hardware sensors  the last ces before this year was called the quantified self ces because there were so many wearables, the apple watch being one of many  so, it sort of entered into the mainstream, in a certain sense  it remains to be seen where it goes next  you re probably not wearing your fitbit today    tim ferriss   i m not   kevin kelly   so, some people have spells with this, where they find it useful, and the question is,  how deep can these sensors go so that they re kind of something that everybody does, and it s the new normal?  i think we re still a ways from that   tim ferriss   i don t think we re that far away from it being opt out, though, instead of opt in  and for most people, actually, you re already quantifying yourself because you have an iphone with an accelerometer that has location tracking and so on  the fascination that i have with your life extends in many different directions, but one is that there s the kevin kelly, futurist technologist, and then there s the kevin kelly   and they re one and the same, of course   who sends me your family letters  i love getting these letters  they read like fiction, quite frankly  it s straight out of like rin tin tin  i remember just recently getting a text from you, and it was from a number i didn t recognize  what did it say?  i just finished tracking elephants     kevin kelly    temple procession elephants in kerala, and i m on my way to oman tomorrow,  or whatever   tim ferriss   yeah,  would you like to come?  and i was like,  i m sorry, who is this?  and you spend time with the amish   we talked about this in the first episode we did together, certainly   but at the same time, we  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    can get really granular and tactical  but first, before we go to my questions about email and books and hamilton and so on, why do you spend so much time in china? you ve written a little bit about this in your family letter updates, but you seem to spend, every year, more and more time in china  and why do they love you so much? kevin kelly   so, it s a very complicated reason  my connection to china is kind of deep, starting with the fact that my wife is chinese  my kids are all bilingual and have spent time in china  but more importantly, i wrote a book called out of control 25 years ago, or maybe more now   1994, i guess   and it was a little early because it was about how the internet was going to happen before the internet really happened  it was about how these decentralized, sharing things were almost biologically inspired, and they were going to go into our built environment  that s what i was talking about, and i was talking about all the rules that the internet was going to run by before there was an internet  it never really took off in the us, but it was translated into chinese   crowd source translated   about five years ago, and it was just at the right time, when pony ma, jack ma, and all these guys in china were starting their internet companies  they read the book in chinese, and were influenced by it, and talked about it  there s a little bit of a social herd mentality in china, so when these famous successes were talking about this book    tim ferriss   i don t think we do that at all in the us   kevin kelly   that s exactly right  everybody started to buy it, so i became, for better or worse, kind of the alvin toffler of china, and they have this ridiculous idea that i m predicting the future  in fact, there were very few predictions in the book  it was just that i was talking about things that later on became common  so, they always introduce me as  the guy who invented the internet  or  who predicted the internet,  and of course, the next person who introduces me has to kind of ratchet that up even higher, so it s embarrassing at this point  but i have a lot of fans in china who are trying really hard to be innovative  they re kind of listening to people from the west   not just me   about how to do that in their culture, so my book has become one of those books that they are reading to understand  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    where it s going because they are rushing into that future so fast that they really need all the guidance they can get  tim ferriss   for people who don t know toffler, can you give a little context?  kevin kelly   yes  alvin toffler wrote a book called future shock in the  70s or  80s  i don t remember when it was  he, in some ways, for a long time, was the most famous futurist, and even people who didn t know what he was talking about knew him as a futurist  if you knew about a futurist, it was alvin toffler, even though you hadn t read his book  i have the same thing in china, where people might recognize my name and call me a futurist even though they ve never read anything by me  alvin toffler s book, future shock, is still worth reading  he was the one who introduced the term  future shock,  which was that people would have a resistance or a reaction to the future in general just because things were changing fast  he also invented, in that same book or the next one, the term  prosumer,  which is a person who is both producing and consuming   which we now call  user generated content    this idea that most of this economy would be prosumers  that was his idea in like the  70s or  80s, so he was way ahead of it   tim ferriss   that s incredible  how do you see china changing in the next, say, 10 to 20 years?  kevin kelly   i believe that china is, within five years, on the cusp of actually having a global brand of something that everybody in the world would want   tim ferriss   meaning a nike or a fill in the blank?  kevin kelly   exactly  whether it s a car or a drone or a camera or some appliance or device or digital thing, it would be world class in its innovation and its quality, like sony eventually became for the japanese  the reason why i think that is because, as you said, i go there a lot  i go there probably every three months, and i don t just go to the big cities, where i do my talks, but i always will take an extra week or two and go into the hinterlands, out to hunan or quanchi or some other province, and i spent some time on the silk road way in the west where it s muslim, to get a sense of the other china and to gauge the depth of their dream  i m constantly thinking,  what do the chinese want? they re going so fast  what are they aiming for?  what they re trying to do  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    is innovate, and they re coming to the west to learn how to innovate, like we taught the japanese to do quality  the japanese said,  how do we do quality?  so they went to taylor, and all these guys gave them a list of,  do this and do this and do this, and you ll have quality   the japanese went through their list  they did it, and then they became kind of the world s expert on making quality  the chinese are saying,  how do we do innovation?  and all the people from the west, like me, are like,  you need to have science fairs  you have to have innovation hubs  you have to have startups  you have to have all this stuff   so, they re going down the checklist,  we re going to do that  we re going to do that  we re going to do that,  and i think they are doing it, and they are going to succeed in making something that we all want  i don t know what it is, but i feel that they re really doing all the things they want to do, although there are two cultural characters that they haven t yet gotten too  those two cultural ones are that they haven t yet embraced failure and that they still don t collectively question authority enough  they re working on those, and they know that they have to do those, and they know that those are difficult to do collectively  individually, of course, there s no problem  the chinese who come to america can do all those  but collectively as a culture, those are challenging for them  they re working on them  it ll be some more years, but i think they will do it  tim ferriss   i know we re getting pretty china focused here, but as a sidebar, you were talking about visiting these far flung corners of china  china, for those people listening who haven t been, is a lot more diverse than you might think  in fact, when you hear chinese the language, like mandarin chinese, it s basically beijing dialect chinese  on top of that, if you were to go to china, there are many ways to say chinese, depending on where you are, and it indicates a lot of how you feel  so, you could say,   speaking chinese ,  like the center country, middle kingdom language  then, you can also say,   speaking chinese ,  the language of the han people, who were the dominant ethnic group  if you say,   speaking chinese ,  if you go to taiwan   now, the mainlanders hate that   it means the mainland talk  i m translating very liberally here, and that, of course, really irks the chinese who view taiwan as sort of a rogue province that  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    is, nonetheless, still part of them, much like quebec or something in canada  if you look at, say, singapore, singapore has tried, with some success, for at least, i would say, the last ten years, to replicate silicon valley, and they ve faced very similar cultural hurdles  but they have fantastic   at least, my impression is   financial resources, they have unilateral freedom to do whatever they want, and they have a well educated population  they are very, very, very small  the sandbox is incredibly small  you can walk around singapore in a day, and then you re like,  what am i going to do here? i need to go to malaysia to have a new meal   why will china differ? is it just the sheer number of people that they have to choose from or filter from, from which you can find the michael jordans, the jeff bezos s, the fill in the blank? kevin kelly   absolutely  i think this is an arithmetic problem   1 4 billion people  by the way, there are like 0 3 billion north americans  it s like there are a billion more of them  i think there definitely is a critical mass, a scale, that the chinese have, and it s almost kind of translated into a momentum that you need, and then that you have this critical mass of people behind you doing  you were mentioning diversity, which singapore does not have as much of  they have a lot for being a little city, but not compared to china  you have a huge diversity in china   not just a language, but even ethnically and geographically  and so, i think they have all those necessary requirements, the requisite complexity, that you would need to make something  but i would say two things  one is that if they attempt to make another silicon valley, i think that fails  there are network effects in all of these things, and the network effects are that the best get bigger, and that the bigger you get, the better you get, and that the better you get, the bigger you get  so, you have this sort of compounding acceleration  that means that there are only going to be one or two dominant players  and, by the way, ai is going to be a network effect phenomenon  social media is a network effect phenomenon  the kind of startup culture is a network effect phenomenon in a particular category  so, if they try to do a silicon valley for software, it will not happen  if they decide to take something   which i think they might   like robotics or aviation or biotech, and really develop and grow it to a sufficient scale, i think they could have an equivalent, and right now, they do have one in manufacturing   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    in the pearl river delta area, from guangzhou to shenzhen, and hong kong, they do the world s best manufacturing in china  it s not because it s the cheapest  it s because it s the best  and they have this whole ecosystem with thousands and thousands of suppliers and dynamic, real time inventory control, and this whole thing  so, they do have the silicon valley for manufacturing in that area, and they will continue to grow that  people are going there not because they re the cheapest   in some cases, they aren t   but because they have the absolute best in manufacturing  tim ferriss   for those people listening, kevin and i decided to wing it  we had a conversation prior to recording, and this is just us talking about stuff that we re interested in  so, i ve been, over the last few weeks, discussing with folks, visiting silicon valley and the origins of silicon valley, or trying my best to explain why silicon valley may have happened here and not elsewhere  how much of silicon valley do you think can be attributed to a handful of companies that just happened to land here, like fairchild or some of these semiconductor companies  the inability to enforce non compete contracts in california, which i think allowed these people to then split off and form many other companies that might have stepped on their former bosses  territory  or other? when somebody asks you,  why did silicon valley happen here?  what do you say?  kevin kelly   there are reasons why, and there was actually a really good book on this by anneliese axline, i believe her name was, and she studied route 128 around boston and silicon valley, and compared the two because route 128 actually had a little head start in this kind of tech world, and why they didn t become the silicon valley   tim ferriss   why did sand hill road kill them?  kevin kelly   there are a number of different reasons, but one of them was because   i think you mentioned a couple, but there are others   silicon valley was so far from the west coast government, the dc government    tim ferriss   the east coast government   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin kelly   excuse me, the east coast government, dc   that they had to find a whole bunch of different sources for funding  they invented the funding model  128 around boston was still locked into a lot of the government defense contracts  so, that was kind of a difficulty but a liberation for silicon valley, where it was really divorced from the government handouts, government subsidies, or government funding   not completely, but enough to actually really develop this alternative way of financing things   tim ferriss   venture capital   kevin kelly   right, venture capital  and i think, psychologically, there was this other division, this other kind of whole california story of  no adult supervision,  not asking for permission, which started in  49ers and before  i think that also continued to influence the culture  so, there was a cultural innovation, and many people say that the greatest invention from silicon valley was not the transistor or software  it was this model, this innovation model, that that is the kind of meta    tim ferriss   the  innovation model  meaning the set of beliefs and maxims and so on that those people carried in their heads?  kevin kelly   exactly, right  it s the venture funding model, the startup model, this method, this culture that would reward  the joke was that you change a job and you walk across the street  and also, it was the fact that you were encouraged to change your job  far from lifelong employment, it was this idea that you ve been here a couple of years, so it s time to move on  and so, there are a whole bunch of things that are ingredients to that, and this book studied this in kind of a more economically rigorous way of,  why did one surpass the other?   tim ferriss   there are a number of fascinating documentaries on this, as well, and maybe it s all sort of hindsight logical, but in reality, 90 percent of it was just a random collision of people and factors  i don t know   kevin kelly   i would also recommend john markoff s book with this really trippy title called what the dormouse said, which is about the hippie origins of the personal computer industry  so, there s a whole other strand that is very influential, which was the fact that the hippie generation embraced computers unlike the other technologies that they rejected  they embraced them from doug  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    engelbart to steve jobs to a lot of the ai guys  a lot of the people in the early computer industry had kind of a little of the hippie background, and they saw these things as augmentations, as basically kind of a new age way to augment the human  so, people had tried the communes  they didn t work, with their long hair, but they learned a lot of skills, including small business skills, making their candles, their sandals, and their macram , selling honey, or doing whatever it was  so, unlike people who went to college and never dropped out, who went to work for the big organizations like the ibms, they were at craft fairs getting business skills  then, when they came along, they transferred those directly into this idea of small businesses, which were not cool  if you told somebody in the  50s that you were at a startup, that was code for,  i m unemployed  i was fired   tim ferriss   it s like  consultant,  right?  oh, you mean unemployed   that was the analog  have you ever been to   i know i m jumping around here   to christiania in copenhagen?  kevin kelly   yes, in copenhagen   tim ferriss   so, there s this area   for people who haven t been   called christiania  i m pretty sure i m getting it roughly right  it s effectively like a hippie anarchist commune around copenhagen  there are gates that you walk through, and it says,  here ends the european union,  when you walk through  and as you described, there are people walking their kids around in wheelbarrows, making honey, making candles  they have breweries  it s such a funky experience   kevin kelly   it s a little autonomous region  it started off as kind of a squatter city that is not semi legal, in some capacity, and they do have their own little government at this point  it s quite extensive  it s not quite as big as singapore, but    tim ferriss   it s not that far off   kevin kelly   right  it s a worthy experiment to go visit because there are a lot of alternative governments and structures, and cultures are really important  let me just say one thing about travel before we go into other things  i travel a lot, and not just to china, but to other places, as  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    much as i can because i find that it really keeps my mind flexible  in fact, i find that it s the most exercise that i can do in a short amount of time, more than anything else  sure, i can learn a new language and do these other things, but i find you can do all those while you re traveling, too  travel really forces me to be flexible, to confront others, and to think about things differently  even if i have a different idea there, it s just the habit of trying to think and come at things differently that i find really, really, useful, in addition to the fact that you actually, literally, are looking at your own culture from a different lens, and even just the general habit of trying to let go of what you think you know  i go to china, above all else, because every time i go, i have decided that i know less than the last time  there is so much happening there, it s happening so fast, and it s so big that the chinese have no idea what s happening  i think i know something, and then i go, and i realize that i don t know what s happening here either  i know less than the last time i visited  tim ferriss   or it s a different country than the last time you were there   kevin kelly   exactly, right  so, i think travel is so important, particularly to young people, that i really believe it should be subsidized at the federal level   tim ferriss   i think gap years should be mandatory   kevin kelly   i think a two year national service should be a requirement, and you can fulfill it any way you want, including going overseas and working at the peace corps, a visa, or whatever it is  take two years   if you want to go do military, that s fine  if you want to go to inner city, that s fine  if you want to go overseas, that s fine  we ll pay you for two years   nothing would transform america as much as having an overseas experience for the majority of people who, by the way, don t have passports at this moment   tim ferriss   i agree  i could not agree more  and we agreed on a few other things earlier  when we were talking about podcast questions and i was making some funky mushroom coffee, not of the psychedelic sort, that i ll describe some other time, you suggested that i ask people about their email systems  how do they handle inbound email?  kevin kelly   right  for ordinary people, they get a lot of email, but if you have any level of success, notoriety, or prominence, dealing with  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    incoming email in a sane way that actually works is a real mystery to me  so, people like you or people who get a lot of demands on them, how do you actually deal with email? do you have more than one account? if you have more than one account, how do you handle it? do you have your assistant involved? tim ferriss   etc , etc  there are many different facets to it  and you mentioned that you had a conversation with jeff bezos, and i said we had to save that for the podcast  so, now i have to ask, what was this conversation?  kevin kelly   i had the opportunity to ask jeff, at some point, about his email because i wanted a sense of,  who do i send it to? how do you do your email?  he said   and i think this is probably a ten year old answer, so i can t verify that this is still happening    i finally figured out what to do  here s what it is  anything you send to me    and his email s actually fairly well circulated    my assistants will read, and they are in charge of doing something with it     tim ferriss   right, vetting   kevin kelly    to give the appropriate response, but i also read it all  i don t really normally answer it, unless there s something  then, if there is something that i want to respond to, i ll respond  so, the worstcase scenario is that you ll get two replies   from my assistant, if it needs to be replied to, and me   so, in other words, everything goes through in parallel circuit  one is to his assistants, and they deal with what has to be, and most of it s probably going to be, ignored  for those that need to have something done, they nudge him or whatever  and he s also looking at it, and he can reply personally to it  he said the worst is that you might get two  so, he has one email, and i have gotten responses to that email, and sometimes it just kind of goes and, obviously, he doesn t need to respond to it   tim ferriss   to the ether  this is something that i ve had to get increasingly better at  the tools and tactics as i laid them out, for instance, in the 4 hour workweek, still work very well   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    however, i ve had to develop more nuanced layers on top of what i did because now it s thousands of email coming and hitting me, my assistants, and everyone  decisions have to be made for how to vet and use tools like boomerang to schedule things to be sent in the future, or automatic follow ups, you name it  moving a lot of internal communication to slack so that it s separate from the inbox  etc  do you still have an assistant and a separate researcher? kevin kelly   i do  i have an assistant and a fulltime researcher, but they don t do my mail  i do all my own mail   tim ferriss   what is your researcher currently helping you with, if you can talk about it?  kevin kelly   i would love to talk about it  in fact, we just had a review today  i ve been working on a project    tim ferriss   a review meaning that you reviewed    kevin kelly   we have an annual review  i have an annual review with the two people who work for me  once a year, we sit down and do an employee review  we talk about the past year, and we evaluate what s coming up  her name is camille, and what camille s working on is gathering every long term forecast that we can find anywhere in any of the industries or published anywhere  we re bringing them together, and we re going to try to integrate all of the long term forecasts into an integrated forecast of the future    long term  meaning ten years or more   tim ferriss   so, forecasts could be anything from,  this is how we see gasoline prices moving in the next 20 years,  to,  this is how we anticipate the number of seats filled in air travel to move in the next 20 years    kevin kelly   right  and we re going even broader, like the future of sports, the number of attendees at sports game, transportation    we re going through the whole list of things  she s been working on it for six months, and we probably have another six months  this is what i call the  official future   having been trained in gbn, which was a consultancy that did strategy for global companies, the mantra was that all predictions are wrong and, particularly, official futures  so, there s official extrapolation  you take what s been happening for the past five years, and you  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    extrapolate  they are invariably not correct because things jig and jag, and new things are invented that kind of disrupt the pattern  my premise is that, while they are wrong, they re still useful, and they would be particularly useful if they were integrated together  so, you would say,  the future of transportation looks like this, and the future of electric cars looks like this, and these both can t be right  they have to kind of inform each other in some ways   so, that s the next step of kind of integrating and having these official futures inform each other, to see if i can make a scenario that s more useful out of the sum of the parts  so, she has been working on that for six months, and she also did the research when i was doing the big cover story for wired on vr  so, for five months, i was trying out every single vr headset input content that i could, and i wrote this article  the way wired works, like other magazines, is they have this fact checking, which is in some ways kind of a legal, cover your ass thing, which means that every single statement that i make has to be verified and proven, like a scholarly article, like a footnote, which is totally insane, but that s what you have to do  so, you say something that seems obvious to you, some statement like,  people get sick in it,  or,  they have motion sickness   can you prove that? where does that come from? how do you know about that? so, she did a lot of that hard legwork and finding the documentation for these kinds of statements that aren t footnoted in the article, but actually are footnoted in what i turn over to them  so, i have a completely scholarly footnoted article  people don t realize that, but behind the scenes with new yorker and wired and places like that, there s a fulltime staff that will fact check every single fact  tim ferriss   oh, yeah, it s a big, dedicated staff   kevin kelly   by the way, books do not do that, and newspapers do not do that   tim ferriss   yeah, we could spend a lot of time talking about all of that   kevin kelly   so, going back to my assistant, i have a researcher who does all that kind of research and anything else i need research on  that s the main thing   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    this was my one dream, to have somebody   and this was even before google   to ask  i do a lot of travel, and so, they sometimes do research on simple things like,  is it a sane idea to rent a car in oman, or should i get a driver?  so, you kind of troll the trip advisor boards or lonely planet   tim ferriss   the state department    kevin kelly   yeah, so it s that kind of stuff   tim ferriss   aside from those types of logistics, how do you choose projects for your researcher to help you with? and you could delve into anything you like, so how do you choose?  kevin kelly   projects in general? what am i going to do next?  tim ferriss   sure  yeah, how do you choose what you re going to do next?  kevin kelly   this has taken me a long time to get there  you ve seen these venn diagrams of things that you like to do and things that other people need, but for me, there s actually a third important circle  there are things that i want to do   so that has to be a key thing   that i m good at doing   that s the second thing because there are lots of things i would have fun doing but i m no good at   and then there are things that would maybe be useful to other people  but this other circle that s become more important to me is,  can anybody else do it?  if somebody else can do it, i am not going to do it  i spent a lot of time trying to give away ideas and trying to talk about what i m doing in the hope that someone else comes along and says,  oh, i m doing that,  and then it s like,  oh, phew! what a relief  now i m not going to do that   i talk about this future stuff  if i can find someone else out there, and they write to me and say,  i m doing that,  it s like,  oh, my gosh, thank you! now i don t have to do that   and so, what i m trying to look for is really good things that i would enjoy, that other people value, that nobody else is going to do, and that i can t convince anyone else to do  they think it s a terrible idea, or they think it s a lousy idea, but for some reason, i think it s a good idea, and i can t get anyone else to do it  no one  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    will steal it from me  i m trying to give it away, and no one s going to take it  it s like,  all right, i have to do that now   tim ferriss   that s how i feel about books  i get asked,  why don t you write a book on this? why don t you write a book on that?  and i m like,  there are already plenty of good books on both of those subjects   it has to be something that bothers me for so long, it seems like such a crackpot idea to everybody else, i can t buy it anywhere to scratch the itch, and i m like,  okay, just to fix that neurosis, i have to address it   so, titles are important, and you mentioned the title of a book just a few minutes ago, before we started recording, which caught my attention because we were looking at the slow creep of books and piles on my table, which is ironically right next to this marie kondo book on the japanese magic of cleaning up  i can never remember the name of the book   kevin kelly   let s be more accurate  the book about cleaning up is on a stack of other stuff   tim ferriss   exactly  i took a photograph of it because it s a lot better than it was  it used to be kind of like the trash compactor in star wars, and this book on japanese decluttering would just kind of surf this wave of flotsam jetsam around my house  it s a lot better now  but you mentioned that another book called all too much    kevin kelly   it s all too much, and it actually preceded her book, at least in english  i thought it was so valuable that in this really huge book i did called cool tools, i list it as the very first tool, which is how to deal with all this stuff and how not to have a bunch of stuff  i actually gave it a whole page because i thought the message was so profound  it s not about tidying up and cleaning  he talks about the fact that if you have something that is valuable, you need to show it  if you have collections and they re not visible, then they re not working for you  so, he s not against collecting things, but if you collect them, they have to be prominent  they have to bring you joy  they have to be doing something in your life  what you want with decluttering is basically to remove the junk so that you have room for your treasure  all these kinds of things, where it s not about the stuff, it s about your mental state, your openness to new ideas, and the clutter is, in some ways, prohibiting your self fulfillment, the best you, because  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    you re buried under it  so, there is this sort of   i wouldn t call it pop psychology, but it is a little bit about trying to get at that core of what you re about, what your house is about, and what your life is about, and making room for these things  the kinds of techniques that he uses are very similar to what the japanese gal   i can t remember her name   tim ferriss   kondo   kevin kelly   kondo   which is  you pick up something and ask,  does that object give you joy?  actually, she does it differently  she says,  take everything in your house    and she goes by categories    put all your clothes in the center  make a big pile  by default, you re going to get rid of all of them, but as you re going through, if you pick up something that gives you joy, that s what you keep, and everything else is just gone   and the same is true for all your other possessions  category by category, you decide that they re all, by default, going to be gone, and you only retrieve those things that give you joy  that s a little bit of what he s talking about in that same kind of profound way   tim ferriss   i did try this  i gave it a good college try, and i did find certain aspects of it very helpful, but then there was the joy part of it  i picked up, i remember, these printouts that were like legal documents or tax returns, and i m like,  not joyful  this is not giving me joy, but it would be very neglectful and irresponsible of me to throw these out  now what, marie kondo?  the topic of simplicity is one that i try to consistently return to because our lives tend to entropy, right? what books or resources have you found helpful for simplifying your life? and if that s not the right question, you can tackle it a different way   kevin kelly   i think it s all too much  this kind of decluttering and her book are actually helpful in simplifying things  i m maybe not as big of a fan of simplicity as you are  i think our lives are inherently more complex than our parents and our grandparents  and our children and their grandchildren and future generations will be more complicated  i think that is generally the drift of this thing that we call life, and evolution, and technology, and they re going to become more and more complicated  i think, right now, some people are very upset  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    over our distracted manner or the way we kind of skip through or surf through the nets and internet and social media  i actually think that s a very sane response to the environment, where we kind of have to scan because things are much more complicated, and we ll do more scanning in the future  so, i think maybe there are appropriate kinds of complexity  maybe we avoid complications, and complexity is okay  the thing about life is that it surfs a very fine line between rigid order, which is death, and complete chaos, and there s this edge    edge of chaos,  they call it   this edge where there s this sort of particular kind of falling forward, or particular kind of chaotic order or orderly chaos, or something  so, it s not rigid simplicity, and it s not this overly chaotic complication  there s a variety of complexity that is not just healthy, but it is the source and the genius of, i think, health, wealth, and everything else that we want  tim ferriss   i think that i might be able to ask a better question, which is  in the face of the notifications, and social media pings, and so on and so forth, a lot of people feel anxious, and they feel conflicted and overcommitted  maybe you just mask it really well, but i ve never had that feeling from you  i ve never gotten the impression that you feel those things  why not? are there particular rules or ways that you  ?  kevin kelly   there is one thing, and maybe this is kind of a zen thing  the zen mantra is,  sit sit, walk walk, don t wobble    tim ferriss   i haven t heard that before   kevin kelly   it s this idea that when i m with a person, that s total priority  multitasking? no, no, no, no  so, i have a priority  people topeople or person to person trumps anything else, and if there s something else going on, i have given my dedication to this  if i go to a play or a movie, i am at the movie  i am not anywhere else  it s 100 percent  i am going to listen  if i go to a conference, it s like i am going to go to the conference   tim ferriss   that s true  i ve never seen you on a device while with or near other people, now that i think about it   kevin kelly   even at wired, before, i had a rule  it was like if i m person toperson and the phone rings   no, never  if i m on the phone and the notification rings   no, i m on the phone  so, i think it s this sense  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    of   and you can have a priority if you want, whatever it is   i m going to be present, whatever that is, at that time, and everything else is sort of,  we ll deal with it later   it s,  sit sit, walk, walk, don t wobble   tim ferriss   right  what books have you found   and i always come back to books, but it doesn t have to be books  it could be sources, something that people listening could look at themselves or listen to   have given you rules like that, or maxims or sayings, that have proved very useful?  kevin kelly   i come from religious tradition, and i actually think some of the religious texts are very good for that  i think it s very hard to read the bible all the way through  by the way, i recommend that you do that at least once in your life  no matter who you are, sit down   well, it will take a long time   and read through the bible  read a modern version  it will take you some time, but it is probably the most amazing thing you haven t read yet  it s highly disturbing, highly influential, and whatever your opinion about it is, you re going to be wrong  read it through  it s an amazing book  i would say the same thing about the quran  try to read the sufi stuff  there s nothing that i enjoy more at night than reading rumi  something about it is just   he s a sufi mystic from afghanistan who is a transcendent thought leader maybe like seneca or something  he has tremendous wisdom  so, i think the wisdom of the ancients, in general, has a lot to offer us  i think the reading of things like the zen parables, like the sound of one hand clapping, zen mind, beginner's mind, and that kind of wisdom, it s not like you have to be slavish or obedient to them  take what you find useful and move on  but i ve found a lot of use in those texts   tim ferriss   so, we have, in a sense, these timeless philosophies and belief structures that can help us make better decisions and so on  then, we have subject matter expertise of different types which can become more or less relevant over time  we were chatting, before we started recording, about a question that i get asked all the time, which is,  what industries should i be paying attention to in the next three to five years? what skills should i learn?  most of these are business focused   what skills should i learn to be able to take advantage of new, non obvious industries in the next 10 to 15 years?   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    you mentioned   and i might be getting the wording off   sort of tech literacy or   kevin kelly   technoliteracy   tim ferriss   technoliteracy, different types of literacy  can you elaborate on that?  kevin kelly   let me put it in a little bit of context  i ll talk a bit more, but let me just preface it and say that i do talk a bit about this in my new book, called the inevitable, which is    tim ferriss   i have one of the few copies right here in front of me   kevin kelly   tim has one of the first copies right off the press  it s talking about the next 20 to 30 years, mostly about digital technology and the trends that i consider nonnegotiable   inevitable, in a sense  there s not much we can do about it  there s a lot we can do about the specifics, but not about the bigger trends  they re coming whether we want to    tim ferriss   the inevitable subtitle is understanding the 12 technological forces that will shape our future   kevin kelly   right  and one of the first chapters talks about this question of skills  i think, instead the specifics like,  what language should i be learning in school?  or,  what business skills should i have?  what are more useful and what i counsel even my own kids about are these meta level skills   the skill of learning how to learn, the skill of learning how technology in general operates   which is what i would call the technoliteracy skills  an example of a technoliteracy skill is that   besides the initial purchase cost of a technology, whatever technology you buy   you now have a maintenance cost  that maintenance cost includes making sure that it s upgraded, integrated, or just maintained in some capacity  so, there are several levels of the cost  it s not just how much it costs to buy, but how much it costs to maintain in your life  there s a price to dealing with it when it breaks down, or upgrading  it s sort of like owning a boat, a little bit  it s not the initial cost of the boat, but it s the maintenance that really is the costly part, and it s the same thing with anything that we buy  so, if you get something into your house, there s now a relationship with that thing  it s like having a pet or an animal  you  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    have to deal with it and its interaction with other things  that s just kind of an elementary thing  there is a sense in which there are also negative costs, too, in terms of whatever it is that we have, there is going to be some downside  journalists are usually pretty good about identifying that you should pay attention to what people say about the negative aspects of it because they are real  it s not that it should discourage you from using the technology   and i m going to argue that it shouldn t   but we should be aware of them and willing, in a certain sense, to pay the price  tim ferriss   what would be a clear example to you of a technology with a downside that perhaps is underappreciated, or downsides that are underappreciated?  kevin kelly   automobiles kill 1 million humans on earth every year  now, imagine if we were going to introduce automobiles and say,  we have cars  they will kill 1 million of us  do you want to drive it?   tim ferriss   that s not the best pitch i ve heard   kevin kelly   i know, but that s what i m saying  i m saying that there are all these hidden   but that s real, and this is one of the reasons why i think driverless cars are going   so, here s the thing  when the first driverless car kills a person, people will go completely bananas, but we re killing 1 million of them ourselves, and that s not registered, for some reason  it s like,  that doesn t count?   tim ferriss   yeah, they ve lost the reference point   kevin kelly   right, exactly  so, driverless cars will kill some people, but they re not going to kill as many as we kill  and there are going to be, by the way, ethical issues with driverless cars because we give ourselves a pass when we have an accident  it s like,  oh, i didn t have time to react  i wasn t thinking   but the driverless car has to be programmed, so you have to give it a preference  if there s an accident, do you give the passenger safety preference over the pedestrian?  tim ferriss   right, or do you give the three elementary school kids    kevin kelly   it s the trolley problem   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   exactly, it s the trolley problem   over the seven people who were 70 years old   kevin kelly   right  and so, when you go to buy a car, and volvo says,  hey! we give passengers preference,  is that ethical?  tim ferriss   is the programming one of the selling points?  you are 12 percent less likely to be sacrificed in compromising environments    kevin kelly   and so, technoliteracy is saying we need to be cognizant of this, that there are costs and that there are ethical dimensions to this  and there are other technoliteracy skills like the fact that you don t really want to learn a programming language, but that you want to learn how to learn a language because you re going to have to relearn it later on  you want to understand that when you buy something, it s kind of immediately obsolete, always, by definition  so, one of the things i recommend is that you want to buy things five minutes before you need it and not ever before  there s no sense in hoarding the stuff because it s just going to change   tim ferriss   just in time instead of just in case   kevin kelly   exactly  so, i think those kinds of skills are going to be much more useful  i might have said this before, but when i was at wired and we were doing hiring, first of all, i never looked at anybody s educational background  i looked at their experience  the model that i had in my head was you hire for attitude and train for skills  i wasn t really hiring people for a skill set, per se  it was more of their attitude, their orientation, their technoliteracy, their ability to learn and adapt  that was far more valuable than the particular skills they had  now, at some level, skills play into it, and there is a certain skill requirement, but i think maybe as important are these other levels   tim ferriss   it makes me think of what i think is a bit from neil gaiman s commencement speech,  make good art   he says that at some point he realized that there are three important components if you want to keep a job  they are  get along with people, have people like you  deliver things on time, and be good at your job  he said the good news is that you don t actually need all three  he said you just need two out of the three  if you have two out of the three, they ll keep you around  do things on time and have people like  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    you, or be really, really good  he s like,  you only need two of the three   kevin kelly    do things on time  is really great, but in terms of other people who are self starters   like if you don t have a job and you re trying to do something   the equivalent of that is to just do lots of it over and over and over again  i can t emphasize how important that  doing it a lot  is because it s the only way to find out what you re really good at or what no one else can do  it s a lifelong project   tim ferriss   you have to throw a lot against the wall and see what sticks   kevin kelly   you have to do a lot a lot  the more failures you have, the more successes  it s a really very clear ratio that s linked, and you just have to do a lot  that s the only way you can find out what you re good at  how many college kids, young people coming out, they say,  i don t have that passion  i don t know what i m good at ? the only way i know to find out your passion is to actually work to it by trying lots of stuff and becoming an expert at something   tim ferriss   right  this might sound clich d, but instead of discovering yourself, you re creating yourself  and so, these kids    kids,  i sound like such an old man   these young people graduate from college, and then they want to sit down and journal for ten minutes, or take multiple choice tests to figure out their myers briggs and have their assignment for passion, and i m like,  that s not how this works  you re not a block of ice that s being chipped away to reveal the sculpture underneath  you re actually just a small piece of clay, and all the other bits and pieces need to be added  there s a kernel of it that is you, but you need to construct that, and the way you do that is by doing these experiments and trying x, y, and z and everything else in between   i still feel like i m doing that   kevin kelly   i m still doing that  i m almost 65, and i m still doing that  the people i respect the most in my circle are still doing that  they re still asking themselves, at 70 years old,  what am i going to do when i grow up? who am i? what am i here for? should i be doing this?  that s actually why i respect them so much, because they re still constructing their lives rather than, say, discovering it or finding it  they re constructing it, and i think that s a really wonderful metaphor   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   you said, a while back when we were just putzing around in my living room looking at the living wall and whatnot, that there are no vr experts   kevin kelly   right, right  so, i wrote this big cover story on wired about vr, and a couple years ago, i wrote about ai  by the way, these are the kinds of things that are in my book the inevitable, where i m looking at these things which are coming  so, ai is coming in a big way  vr is coming  the particulars of how it arrives, who owns it, how it s structured, those are not inevitable, those aren t predictable, and they make a lot of difference to us  so, we have a lot of choice in this thing  but one of the things that i want to emphasize is that, right now, basically, there are no vr experts  it s completely open  we   collectively, humans   have no idea how vr is going to work, what content will really work best in vr, what the necessary amount of equipment will be, or what that consumer breakthrough version will be  even though there is vr today, the vr today is good enough to improve  so, it hasn t been good enough to improve, but now, today, with the oculus and the vive and this other stuff, it s now good enough to improve, for reasons like we talked about, and it will improve very fast  but there are no experts  so, that means that a person out there, listening to this, could easily become a vr expert  there are really no ai experts  there are a lot of people working on ai, but compared to what we ll know in 20 years from now, we don t know anything  and so, it s actually not that difficult to become an ai expert   tim ferriss   so, let s say someone listening said,  you know what? i ve read about vr  this is really exciting  i m tired of my comparative literature major  i d like to switch gears and really immerse myself   what would you suggest they do? if they seemed earnest, intelligent, and committed, and they were like,  i want to become a vr expert    or ai, take your pick?  kevin kelly   there is a guy, kent bye, who runs the voices of vr podcast  two years ago, he quit his job and since has done 400 interviews of almost every person working in vr  that s his job now  he just does interviews of the voices of people working in vr  he s kind of doing the journalistic side  i would say   very, very easy   you purchase some gear, and you start making vr  you actually do it  you ll get a pair of google  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    cardboard, which you can get for free, and use your phone, and start making vr  you ll learn more about it than reading about it, than working, than whatever it is  try to make a vr experience  make something for five minutes  the issues are incredible  there are lighting issues  there are continuity issues  we don t even have a vocabulary for it  like in cinema, we have a whole syntax of what a  cut  is, how you do a  jump  or  dissolve    tim ferriss   a  panning shot  of x, y, and z   kevin kelly   none of that really works in vr  it doesn t mean the same thing, so somebody has to invent all those  the interface, the mouse   there s no mouse for vr  there are people who have invented it, but there s nothing that has worked like the windows mouse that engelbart made  there is so much that has to be invented  somebody who just decides that they re going to work at this every day, or every day on weekends, or whatever it is, can make a huge advance  i think you ll need to do it because you love it  this is not economics  we re talking about investing into mastery   tim ferriss   i was having a chat with marc andreessen recently, and he said   what did he say? i just had a complete mental blank  i need more tea  he said a lot of very interesting things, and you will hear about them another time because i just had a complete premature alzheimer s moment  so, that s going to have to be a footnote for later  what are you most excited about right now?  kevin kelly   i m going to take that in the professional sense    tim ferriss   take it in any sense  i value your opinion   kevin kelly   in the personal sense, i m still very excited about asia  asia is a combination, for me, of the future   i go to china to hear what the future will be   and also because i have a love for the asian traditions that are disappearing very, very fast, and i m trying to record them  so, i go to asia to photograph these disappearing traditions, ceremonies, and whatnot  tim was just joking that i just came back from kerala, india, where i was photographing these massive elephant processions that the temples have with 40 elephants parading through, and all kinds of ceremonies  i don t know how long they can continue that  it s a very expensive, elaborate spectacle, and not just in one place but throughout the rural areas  it s like other areas   as they become  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    modern, some of these traditions become harder to hold onto  i m not nostalgic about wanting to keep them or protect them  i just want to record them because i think they will go away  so, that excites me  i m working on another book, and it s personally something i love to do for joy  that s the only reason   just because i love to record and document these things, and see them  but the other thing i m excited about in the world of the future is ai  i can t over enthuse on the disruptive nature that i think ai will be, in the broadest sense  many people use analogies, and i have several analogies, but the one that maybe would make sense to most people is  the industrial revolution was this huge, huge thing from the world of agriculture, where we used our own physical muscles and the muscles of animals to get things done, and then we had this thing where we automated that with artificial power   electric power and steam power and, later, gasoline power  this was artificial animal power, artificial human power, that we used to make our lives so much easier and so much different  this house has been built using this automated power  imagine if you had to make it by hand  it s just insane  we couldn t do it  so, all these motors and the harnessing of that power propelled this industrial revolution into the modern world that we have  150 years ago, farmers would take an item, like a hand pump, and say,  we ll make it electric   so, they took things and they electrified them  what we re doing now   we re at the very beginning of it   is we re going to take all of the things that we electrified, and we re now going to cognify them  we re going to add intelligence to them   everything, and not just things that are electric but even inert things like a chair, like the door  people laughed and said,  you re going to put a computer in a door?    20 or 30 years ago    yes   go to a hotel today  there s a computer in your door  there s a little card reader  so, we re going to just keep adding this, and it s going to get smarter and smarter in multiple different ways  so, that intelligence, what i call  artificial smartness,  is not like human intelligence  it s like artificial power  it s like synthetic learning  it s just a very specific, narrow, brute force kind of intelligence  when you drive a car, it s what? 240 horsepower  you have 240 horses at your disposal  and we re going to do the same thing with copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    ai, like you re going to have 250 minds right here to do whatever it is that you want to think about and solve  you just hire this  and so, it ll be like electricity in the sense that you re not going to make the ai  you re going to buy  it would be in the cloud  tim ferriss   it ll be like amazon web services   kevin kelly   exactly  in fact, google is now selling their ai  you can purchase ai from google today  and that s what we ll do, yes  it s  0 60 per 1,000 instances   tim ferriss   really?  kevin kelly   yes  and google ai can do amazing things like it can look at a picture and tell you what s going on in a picture, and you can actually ask it questions  you can say,  what s that person wearing? what color is that hat? what are they doing?  and it will tell you back    0 60 per 1,000   tim ferriss   what would your response be to those who have a fear of the rise of the machines   skynet and the summoning of demons we can t control, etc ? how would you respond to that or comment on it?  kevin kelly   i would say, first of all, it s possible but very unlikely   tim ferriss   why do you say that?  kevin kelly   there are a lot of reasons  one is that the general trend is that automation, including this ai, will create more jobs than it destroys, and it will take a lot of jobs away  i think in 20 years, at least 50 percent of the people driving trucks will no longer drive trucks  and by the way, truck driving is the most common occupation in the us   tim ferriss   i did not know that   kevin kelly   yes, so 50 percent of those will not have jobs, especially the longhaul trucks and stuff like that  so, there will be jobs   i like to think that there are tasks   that are going to be taken away   automation tasks, including white collar tasks like mortgage, people working in bank loans, or anything like that  if you have a job that s defined by productivity or efficiency, that s a job that s going to go to the ai   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    so, productivity is for robots  productivity is for robots  what humans are going to be really good at are asking questions, being creative, and experiences  almost everything in our world, right now, is becoming cheaper and cheaper in cost  the few things that are increasing in cost are all experience based  tickets to a concert, tickets to hamilton, tickets to travel, personal coaching, nursing care, weddings, etc  those are the things that are going up in price because they re not commodifiable  they re not manufacturable  they re experiencedbased  they re not efficient  science is terribly inefficient  you re not learning anything unless you re making mistakes  that s inefficient, by definition  innovation is inherently inefficient  so, we will move to those things  they don t all have to be highbrow   nursing care, being a companion for someone, giving them attention, giving them an experience, etc  there s a big room there  but i think we re going to move away from things that are going to be measured in terms of efficiency because anything that s concerned with efficiency   whether it s white collar, knowledge work, or physical work   goes to the robots  tim ferriss   what has been the most impressive vr experience, or profound, that you ve had?  kevin kelly   this is a good question because i saw them all, and i saw the secret of magic leap, which had a really good visual representation, but it turns out    tim ferriss   magic leap being augmented reality?  kevin kelly   they call it a mixed reality because it s the kind where you have a clear glass that you re wearing, like google glass, but you have a full vision, and there is a synthetic or artificial object, or a being, or something in your vision  so, i could be looking around this room, and i would have these glasses on, and i could see either a virtual screen, or a virtual teacup, or a virtual book, or a virtual animal, and it would be really present   tim ferriss   yeah, for people who want to just get a sample of this, i m sure you could just google it, but there s also a really, i thought, good piece written by chris dixon on,  what s coming next in computing?  i think that was the title, the headline  there s a little animated gif of magic leap    kevin kelly   magic leap, right   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   it s a demonstration of this little   it looks like a japanimation kind of robot hanging out under someone s desk   kevin kelly   right, and it s very vivid  i saw the robot, and where it doesn t work, where they have to improve, is that that object is not lit in the same way as the rest of the room  so, there s a little mismatch to do that  to light that thing and render it in real time with the light of the room, we re way off on that  so, what you have is an artificial thing that s really there  it s like having a cartoon thing  you know it s not really real, but it really is there   tim ferriss   it s like who framed roger rabbit?  kevin kelly   yeah  but that s very useful if you re designing a prototype and you can actually walk around  you can have a virtual screen  they talk about this being the last screen because, within it, if you wear this goggle, you can have virtual screens that are very, very highly detailed  i could watch an hd movie in it without any discomfort at all  so, you can have as many screens as you want, and you re interacting with them, but you just take off the goggles and they re gone, which means you can also make them appear anywhere you want  so, this is the future of work, and you can actually have teleconferencing, which is another thing, where you have a virtual person next to you, and that is amazing, and it s something that i would pay like   i don t know   thousands of dollars for, right now, if i could have that   tim ferriss   so, were you, in general, then, more impressed by the augmented reality or mixed reality than virtual reality?  kevin kelly   augmented or mixed reality is the more difficult of the two to do, and if you can do mixed reality, you can do vr just by turning lights out and making it black  so, technically, vr is a subset of the mixed reality  so, the visual accomplishment of magic leap is there, but that wasn t the most amazing experience i had  it turns out that the visual is only 50 percent of your sense of experience  it s the tactile  it s the audio, and the feeling, and using your hands and your body   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    the best experience i had that was really amazing was something called the void, based in utah  they are making an arcade version of vr where they provide all the equipment, and you go and you pay for an experience, say for half an hour  you pay  30 00 for 30 minutes, and you go in  it s a full vest  you re suited up, and it s amazing  it really is because it mixes the real and the virtual  let me give you kind of an example  there s something called  redirected walking   the way redirected walking is is imagine you have your goggle on, you see something inside, and you turn 90 degrees, a hard 90 degree turn to the right  but what you ll see is only an 80 degree shift  they re cheating you 10 degrees, and they can compound that cheat so that you think you re walking in a straight line for a mile across this amazing cityscape   tim ferriss   oh, but they have you go in a slight arc   kevin kelly   you re going in a circle   tim ferriss   that s wild   kevin kelly   you re going in a circle, and you don t know that  and they can do redirected touching, where you re grabbing things, and you think you re grabbing different things, but it s the same thing  or even stairs   you think you re walking up the stairs, but it s just stairs that are cycling through   tim ferriss   they re rotating   kevin kelly   right  and so, they re able to give you a 30 minute where you re exploring this incredible thing, and it s just a little tiny room  here s the other cool thing they did  so, you re wearing this vest, this haptic vest that s vibrating and doing all kinds of stuff  they had you go up this elevator, and you re kind of on the second story  it was kind of an indiana jones demo that i saw  there was this floor right before you, and it s rocky and not very stable, and you need to get across  and you re walking across, and you fall down two stories, and what happens is you re on a platform that moves 6 inches, but you have just fallen two stories   tim ferriss   wow! that sounds terrifying   kevin kelly   well, no, it s exhilarating!  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   so, does the floor just drop out from under you, like cartoon style, and then you re like floating for a second, and then you drop?  kevin kelly   exactly   tim ferriss   oh, my god  i hope they have great waivers   kevin kelly   of course, it only moves 6 inches  the point of all this is that there are all these tricks to what we assign our own believability of what is real and where we are  it s just like cinema exploits a trick of our vision  you think mickey mouse, which is not a real character, is throwing a baseball, and you think that ball is really moving across the screen, but there s no movement  there s only a series of still images that we can assemble in our brain  vr is exploiting a similar set of new discoveries so our bodies believe that these things are happening  our minds know    tim ferriss   well, it s like going from optical illusions to full body sensory illusions   kevin kelly   exactly  and this turns out to be very, very important  and so, what i say is, and what i discovered from looking at this vr is, that we re moving from an internet of information, where you can get any information anywhere in the world   anybody who lives anywhere can have all the information they want   to an internet of experiences  this is very, very powerful   experiences  so, it s not just the experience of horror or falling, but all kinds of other experiences that we re going to have  when you re there, you come out of these vr, and it s not that you remember seeing something  you remember something happening to you  it s a much different presence  in fact, first person shooter games turn out to be a little too emotionally exhausting when you re in vr   tim ferriss   it produces ptsd if it gets real enough   kevin kelly   yes  there was this vr documentary of going to a pig slaughter, and you re in the chute with the pigs  people said,  i could watch that, but i can t go through it  i can t be in there   and there was another demo someone had called  killing the alien  where you have to stab this alien being, but there s haptic involved and    copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   what do you mean by  haptic ?  kevin kelly    haptic  is this term for tactile sense or touch  they call it haptic technology, and it means that when you grab something, there s a response to it, or you could feel it   tim ferriss   like there s a resistance or texture?  kevin kelly   there s a texture  there is a lot of work in how you get the sense that you grabbed something or you could feel something   tim ferriss   how far do you think we are from vr sex?  kevin kelly   well, let me tell you  i had a great one last night! well, there s teledildonics   tim ferriss   teledildonics, where you can remotely integral various sex apparatuses   kevin kelly   i saw these guys who have a technology for what is called  volumetric capture,  3 d volumetric capture, which means that    tim ferriss   i m getting all sorts of terrible images in my head   kevin kelly   right  so, with volumetric capture, they use like seven or more cameras to record a person in all their detail so that when you see them in vr, they re moving around, and you can see every single hair, and you can see    tim ferriss   i ve been volumetrically captured before, and it s    kevin kelly   live? or was it a snapshot?  tim ferriss   it was a still   kevin kelly   that s the difference  this is not a still   tim ferriss   no, understood, but even the still was eerie because it was exactly me  it was just mapped  if you zoomed in, you could see these tiny, little grids, and it was like,  whoa, okay    kevin kelly   so, the volumetric capture of a live movement is amazing, and you re in a 3 d presentation of it  i felt uncomfortable even getting close to that person, like you re in their space  you react to it  they really feel like they re there, and if they are giving you eye contact  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and a voice, you have a total   again, going back to their body, maybe your mind says they re not really there, but your body is saying,  they are there  that s them   and it turns out, the second life is now doing a vr version called sansar, and it s a thousand times better than the old second life because those avatars are getting their body language from that person  they re getting the voice, and they have the eye contact  and even if the avatar is not exactly them, you can still see them with their voice, their body movements, and their micro expressions  they re really there  tim ferriss   when do you think the haptic technology will be at a point where    kevin kelly   okay, we re back to sex?  tim ferriss   oh, yeah  dating in san francisco s a real pain in the ass  i can skip the pleasantries and just have    kevin kelly   the reason why i mentioned the volumetric capture is i was saying,  this is amazing,  and i was saying,  like sex, right?  and they were saying,  those are the first people who have come to us, all the porno  they were the first to say,  we ve got to have that    and i think i heard that pornhub actually has a vr channel now, or something   tim ferriss   it wouldn t surprise me  it s the most popular website in the world that no one admits to going to   kevin kelly   they ve been way ahead in terms of their use video grammar, summaries, and stuff like that  i haven t seen it personally, but i think that, to answer your question, i m sure that, right now, there are probably one or two places that have probably put this together   tim ferriss   if you were a betting man, if you had to be, would you say it ll be available to those who can afford it in five years?  kevin kelly   oh, absolutely  it ll be fewer than five years, absolutely fewer than five years  as i was saying, the void is already open  it s here  to outfit your whole body like this is doable now  i think this is going to be something that is going to be mostly regulated by economics and then the law, like where this is going to    tim ferriss   things are going to get really, really nasty really quickly   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin kelly   like is there someone on the other end, or is this like a simulation? is this ai?  tim ferriss   are there actors, like  inaudible   01 24 12 ? are there people who are outfitted with their own haptic suits who you re interacting with, in which case, what types of laws apply?  kevin kelly   and if you re in different states, so, yes, i think this will be a very sticky problem   tim ferriss   what are people worried about right now that you think they shouldn t be worried about? the only reason i ask    kevin kelly   what they shouldn t be worried about? well, i think the idea of the ais taking over and killing us all   cross that one off  i think they shouldn t be worried about gmos  cross that one off   tim ferriss   they should not be worried about gmos?  kevin kelly   they should not be worried about gmos  we genetically modify all the crops that you re eating  we do them in different ways  we do them through breeding, or whatever it is, but they ve all been modified  and actually, if you want to modify crops, modifying their genes with crispr is a lot better than trying to modify them with breeding because, with breeding, you have no control over what happens   tim ferriss   it is a much more elegant process  so, crispr you re not concerned about?  kevin kelly   no  there are things that i am concerned about  in fact, i just saw a documentary last night, which will be released pretty soon  it s called zero days, and it s very well done  it s not sensational  it looks at the stuxnet virus, which was a computer virus that was developed by the us and israel to demolish the uranium processing centrifuges in iran  so, the message is that they were looking at,  can you really destroy physical things with a computer virus?  and the answer is yes  you absolutely can  we re at the point where you can actually affect the physical infrastructure with computers  and then, the question is,  what are the rules for that? is that an act of war?   tim ferriss   like the geneva convention   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin kelly   right  and it turns out that there are no rules, and yet, the us and others are developing these technologies, and nobody wants to talk about them because they re all classified, and therefore, nobody wants to admit to it  therefore, you can t have the conversation about it  and yet, iran retaliated  they made the largest cyber army in response to the efforts to take them down, which did not work in the end  so, there already is cyber warfare going on, but it s not being talked about  it s not being admitted  the us government won t talk about the offensive, and there are now all the other countries who are now building capacity  and what are the rules? is it okay to disrupt the banking system? there is going to be collateral damage  what s accepted? i think the fact that we don t have any rules for cyber war is something i m really worried about   tim ferriss   i remember at a conference a few years ago, this very wellrespected technologist got up and talked about precisely this, cyber warfare, and some of the scarier scenarios and potential tactics that could be used  for instance, if there were a natural disaster in san francisco and people went to google, assuming there was still internet connectivity, to try to determine how to respond, if someone could initiate the disaster somehow and then also figure out a way to present certain search results that were misinformation   that s maybe even more elaborate than is necessary  maybe that s the 007 bad guy, like,  i m going to leave you here with this sophisticated laser set up while i go have a sandwich, mr  bond  i ll see you in 20 minutes,  and then he gets away  maybe it s a lot simpler than that  maybe it s taking out electrical grids with different types of viruses or electromagnetic pulse weaponry  or, for that matter, i ve been astonished at how vulnerable a lot of this stuff is to just long range marksmanship, for instance  it s like old technology applied to an increasingly fragile, in some capacities, internet of things   kevin kelly   exactly  and then, when you introduce ai into that, as the us pentagon has just gotten some funding to have ai do these kinds of things, to weaponize ai, basically, i m also worried about that   kill decisions and this idea that, right now, we have legally mandated assassinations in the us  we have assassinated us citizens   tim ferriss   could you elaborate on that?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin kelly   with the drones  the drone program will take out a particular individual  so, we killed what s his name? he was an american citizen in yemen, i guess, and they targeted him, and they killed him  there was no trial  there was nothing  so, we now have assassination  these drones usually have people back in nevada steering them, and they usually have generals and a whole chain of command involved to do the kill decision  but, increasingly, there is pressure to expand this kind of warfare because you don t have to have troops on the ground  the american public seems much more sympathetic to sponsoring warfare like this, and as that increases, there s the need to have it autonomous  so, there s a very long feedback loop to come back and have humans decide this and that  if you could have autonomous ai driven drones that didn t need that, then they could actually be making these decisions  that s scary  that s very scary   tim ferriss   this is also a topic of common debate in silicon valley in the ai circles  there are some people who would say,  if you look at deep mind or some of these other ai focused groups in the us, they have ethics committees  they are collaborating with one another to look at safeguards  the real people you need to be worried about are sort of the fast moving solo acts in places like china and places like fill in the blank who do not have that safetyfirst mentality   and people would argue that maybe that s not the case in the us either, in certain places, but if someone were going to cause a big mess with ai, who do you think is the most likely? what are the characteristics?  kevin kelly   ai is still so early that i wouldn t hazard a guess, but i do acknowledge, and i would emphasize, that this is a global enterprise  the chinese are very keen on making ai  the three ingredients you need for ai these days are  these deep neural nets, like deep mind  huge farms of gpus, graphical processing units, which have been commoditized by the video game industry    tim ferriss   like in video chips   kevin kelly   it turns out that there are parallel processors that are really affordable  so, before, ai was done on supercomputer parallels that would cost millions and millions of dollars, and then it turns out that these little video chips that you make for video games were parallel processing, and they were really cheap  so, now, they buy these big farms of these cheap video game processors   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    so, you need lots of those, and then, you need big data  big data is sort of the rocket fuel  so, companies like baidu and alibaba who have big data are actually able to do this kind of ai right now  there s no monopoly on ai right now  china, europe, and even japan will all get into this business  i would expect, just given history, that there will be an ai disaster of some sort  tim ferriss   it s inevitable  it s not to say that ai shouldn t be pursued  it s just like anything else   kevin kelly   right  someone will abuse it   tim ferriss   if you re going to have large scale water projects, there is going to be some horrible flood that ll kill a bunch of people, or fill in theblank disaster   kevin kelly   right  so, we have to be ready for that and not freak out, which is what i think will be one of the tendencies,  okay, stop ai research  no more federal funding ai   that will also happen, too  people will respond to that by saying we have to stop ai   tim ferriss   if you had to, again, sort of play nostradamus a little bit, what do you think the first few big wins of ai will be, where people will really step back and go,  whoa ?  kevin kelly   there are two things  i think there will be these huge, huge big wins, but what s very curious about this is that whenever these wins happen, as they have in the past, then immediately we don t call it ai  ai is only what we can t do  what we hope to do is called ai, and once we do it, it s called machine learning  so, the first big win will be like a translation  we ll have a little device that we can wear in our ear, and it ll hear you speaking chinese, and it ll whisper english to me  we ll have that in   i don t know   five years or so, but we re not going to call it ai   no, that s not ai  they re just dumb computers doing this stuff   it s no longer ai  people don t think of siri as ai   oh, that s just machine learning    tim ferriss    it s just siri    kevin kelly   driving the car? that s no longer ai    of course computers can drive a car  of course they can play chess    because once it happens, it s like,  of course   that s obviously not ai  ai is sort of always what we can t do   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and so, there will be these wins, like perfect translation, that will be very common, and talking to these assistant bots  that s the other thing  you ll have these conversations,  let s do this, do that    echo   tim ferriss   i was going to say that sounds a lot like an early iteration of echo   kevin kelly   right  is that ai? do people think of that as ai?  no, that s not ai  that s just echo,  or whatever it is  and so, i think that conversation is the interface, mostly, to ai for a very long time, and we ll get really good at that, and then, i think people will ignore it, or people will become invisible to that  i think most of the ai will be invisible, like we were talking about amazon web services  it s going to be behind the scenes  it s going to be very particular  right now, your calculator is smarter than you are, in arithmetic  it doesn t freak you out, right? that s great  google is better than you in recall  so, we have this very specific artificial smartness, and that s where a lot of this is  most of the ai we re going to make is not like human intelligence  that s why we re making it  the whole point is to think differently, to make things think differently than us  the reason why we want these ai to drive cars is because they aren t driving like humans  they aren t worried about whether they left the stove on or having an argument with the garage  they are just driving better than we can drive  when google is remembering all the web pages in the world, that s inhuman  it s not anything we could do  and once we see the machines doing it, we ll say,  obviously we weren t the only ones who could do that   it s all in retrospect   tim ferriss   right  this is a total left turn, but do you journal? is that a practice that you have or not really?  kevin kelly   it s an occasional practice  it s something i do occasionally at night, late at night   tim ferriss   when do you do it, meaning what triggers it? what are the occasions on which you decide to journal?  kevin kelly   i haven t been able to determine the trigger, but sometimes, i ll just be seized of this,  i need to sit down, and just journal stuff, and write stuff, and doodle   i haven t been able to detect a pattern, but i have a book that i use called late night, and i usually do it  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    late at night, very late, and maybe there s a buffer that gets filled or something  tim ferriss   you have to unload it  you have to delete the downloaded folder   startup disk almost full  i d better get this into my journal   what change in your life, or behavioral modification, are you proudest of in the last, say, year or recent memory, and which habits or behaviors are you trying to change?  kevin kelly   good question  i think it was mark zuckerberg who was going to give a thank you note every day for 30 days, or something  so, this idea of consciously really trying to express gratitude in kind of a disciplined way is something i m been working on to try to make it more of a habit   tim ferriss   how do you express gratitude? is it a phone call? is it a text message?  kevin kelly   generally, it has been in email  i m not a phone person  i don t like voicemail  i don t like talking on the phone  i came into my professional life   i was basically noticed online, in writing short, telegraphic, email ish stuff, so, for some reason, email is my medium, and i m most comfortable with email   tim ferriss   gratitude  well, on that note, i want to thank you for taking time to have yet another jam session  i always have a blast  what are you up to right now? what would you like people to check out? where can they find you?  kevin kelly   so, i have this book that will be released june 6th  it s called the inevitable, published by viking  it s, i think, a pretty good outline of the technological trends for the next 20 or 30 years  at the highest level, it talks things that we can t ignore and that we really should be embracing  i think that if you re interested in what s coming, you ll really find it very useful because it s not really technical  it s at a high level  if you re looking to where things will be in 20 years, i think i have a pretty good map of where that s going   tim ferriss   so, people can, i m sure by the time they hear this, grab it on amazon  where else? kk org?  kevin kelly   yes  kk org is my homepage and where i hang out  there will be links  if you want other languages or the audible version, kindle, i  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    think that all should be listed there  i may even have a calendar ish thing going  tim ferriss   it ll show what you re up to in terms of speaking engagements or whatever   kevin kelly   right  and in july, i m going to be doing a bunch of stuff of basically appearing on a gazillion podcasts  i ve dedicated that for the month of july   tim ferriss   that is why i like to do mine early   kevin kelly   yes, exactly   tim ferriss    another exclusive tim ferriss show opportunity     kevin kelly   it is  this is an exclusive  i m so delighted, tim, that you reached out and made the invitation to be at your glorious home   tim ferriss   i m thrilled to have you here   kevin kelly   i hope that it was useful to the listeners out there because we did kind of go all over the place   tim ferriss   that s why they come  they come for the ocd plus the adhd with a dash of, hopefully, definitely, intelligence from my guests and occasionally a glimmer of something approaching semiintelligence on my part  everybody, check out kk org  it s full of all sorts of things that i ve recommended many, many times over the years, including  1,000 true fans,  of course, and much, much more than that, like the quantified self  everything can be found somewhere at the hub that is kk org  where on social media, if somebody wanted to say hello, would be the best place to say hello?  kevin kelly   i do look at the twitter stream, and i m kevin2kelly  i have facebook, which i don t look at as much, but actually, i do look at google    tim ferriss   oh, you do?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kevin kelly   i do because i find that the comments and the conversation on it is very, very high quality  even though there are not that many people, those who are there are very active, and i pay attention   tim ferriss   so, if they just search  kevin kelly     kevin kelly   yeah, i m the kevin kelly on google    tim ferriss   perfect  all right, we will put that in the show notes  so, everybody listening, you can find everything we ve talked about, assuming i can track it down, in the show notes at fourhourworkweek com podcast  you can also find links to our previous conversations  we had two very, very fun conversations where we went into a lot of kevin s bio and asked a lot of my rapid fire questions that we ve already covered previously  you re going to find that and much, much more at fourhourworkweek com podcast  and, kevin, thank you very much also for taking the time  i always have so much fun  to everyone listening, as always and until next time, thank you so much for making the tim ferriss show part of your daily podcast experience   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    "
156,164,"Kevin Kelly – AI, Virtual Reality, and The Inevitable (#164)","'he also co founded the all species foundation, a non profit aimed at cataloging and identifying every living species on earth  in his spare time   of course i m using that tongue and cheek   he writes bestselling books, many of them  he co founded the rosetta project, which is building an archive of all documented human languages, and serves on the board of the long now foundation ''as part of the last, he s investigating how to revive and restore endangered or extinct species including the wooly mammoth  that is not made up, folks  we touch on a lot of really fun stuff in the episode  when kevin arrived at my house to record, i had certain plans and i asked him what he wanted to highlight or focus on and we just decided to catch up, as friends  so this is very truly the type of conversation that led me, in the first place, many moons ago to ask, why don t i record these and share these conversations? because i have so much fun catching up with friends like kevin ''this is about as close to a banter over drinks as you re going to get, in my life certainly, putting this out publicly  so i hope you enjoy it  we touch on all sorts of things  stories about jeff bezos and his email management approach, favorite books, impactful books, tech literacy, why there are  no vr experts,  which is very inspiring ''there is a video that didn t make it into this interview but kevin mentioned afterward that i think is  the history of japan in nine minutes  that i highly recommend everybody check out  we talk about the evolution of china, why he spends so much time in china, artificial intelligence, network effects, virtual reality, gmo, we talk about everything  if you think i am the only big fan of kevin, well of course that s not true  here is a little bit of praise for his most recent book called the inevitable and these are real quotes  i ll truncate some of them ''so here we go   anyone can claim to be a prophet, a fortune teller or a futurist, and plenty of people do  what makes kevin kelly different is that he s right   it goes on and on  that s david pogue  many of you will know  then we have  kevin kelly has been predicting our technological future with uncanny prescience for years  now he gives us a glimpse of how the next three decades will unfold  ''that s ernest cline, author of ready player one  and then also referring to the book (the inevitable, that is) marc andreessen (who i had on the podcast recently), co founder of andreessen horowitz and technological icon, refers to it as  an automatic must read   so i hope you enjoy this very informal and wide ranging conversation with none other than kevin kelly  if you want to listen to a longer conversation where i dig into his bio and learn all sorts of nuggets that even i didn t know, then you can check out fourhourworkweek com kevin  just go to fourhourworkweek com  kevin and you can find previous conversations with him  enjoy ''kevin, welcome back to the show ''kevin kelly  it s always a pleasure, tim  it s so great to be here  fantastic low horizontal space  thank you  it s great to have you in my house for a change  i remember still the very first quantified self meet up at your place in pacifica with however many people it was ''kevin kelly  there were twenty five people that showed up with a call to  if you think you re quantifying yourself, come   tim was one of the people who arrived  it was a broad spectrum of folks ''kevin kelly  it was  it was really good  we had no idea what to expect  this is gary wolf and i, probably eight or nine years ago  that was the very first meeting of the quantified self movement  it was a meeting in my studio in pacifica  where is quantified self now? what is the scope of that?''kevin kelly  there s meetings in almost 300 cities around the world  amazing ''kevin kelly  we have an international conference once a year  so it s entered into vocabulary   that is, people talk about it   whether for or against it  there are of course tons and tons of hardware sensors  the last ces before this year was called the quantified self ces because there were so many wearables  the apple watch being one of many ''so it sort of entered into the mainstream in a certain sense  it remains to be seen where it goes next  you re probably not wearing your fitbit today  i m not ''kevin kelly  some people have spells with this where they find it useful and the question is, how deep can these sensors go so they are something that everybody does? it s the new normal  i think we re still a ways from that  i don t think we re that far away from it being opt out though instead of opt in ''kevin kelly  right  for most people   actually, you re already quantifying yourself, because you have an iphone with an accelerometer that has location tracking and so on ''kevin kelly  exactly  the fascination i have with your life extends in many different directions  but one is there s the kevin kelly futurist, technologist  and then there s the kevin kelly, and they re one in the same of course, but another aspect of you which sends me your family letters  i love getting these letters ''they read like fiction, quite frankly  it s straight out of rin tin tin  i remember just recently getting a text from you and it was from a number i didn t recognize  what did it say?  i just finished tracking elephants ?''kevin kelly  temple procession elephants in kerala  and i m on my way to oman tomorrow or whatever  yeah,  would you like to come?  i was like  i m sorry, who this is?  you ve spent time with the amish  we ve talked about this in episodes  in the first episode we did together, certainly  but at the same time, we can get really granular and tactical  but first, before we go to   i have a question about email and books and hamilton and so on  why do you spend so much time in china? you ve written a little about this in your family letter updates, but you seem to spend every year more and more time in china  and why do they love you so much?''kevin kelly  yes, okay  so it s a very complicated reason  my connection to china is kind of deep  starting with the fact that my wife is chinese and my kids are all bilingual and have spent time in china  but more importantly, i wrote a book called out of control twenty five years ago or maybe more now, 1994, i guess  it was a little early because it was about how the internet was going to happen before the internet really happened  it was about how these decentralized, sharing things were going to   they were almost biologically inspired, and they were going to go into our built environment  that s what i was talking about  i was talking about all the rules that the internet were going to run by before there was internet ''it never really took off in the us, but it was translated into chinese, crowd source translated about five years ago  it was just at the right time when honi ma, jack ma, and all these guys in china were starting their internet companies ''they read the book in chinese and were influenced by it and talked about it  there s kind of a little bit of a social herd mentality in china  so when these famous successes were talking about this book   i don t think we do that at all in the u s ''kevin kelly  exactly, right  everybody started to buy it  so i became, for better or worse, kind of the alvin toffler of china  they have this ridiculous idea that i m predicting the future  because, in fact, there were very little predictions in the book  it was just that i was talking about things that later on became common  so they have this idea   they always introduce me as the guy who invented the internet or who predicted the internet  of course, the next person who introduces me has to ratchet that up even higher, so it s embarrassing at this point  i have a lot of fans in china who are trying really hard to be innovative ''they re listening to people from the west   not just me   about how to do that in their culture  so my book has become one of those books that they are reading to understand where it s going because they are rushing into that future so fast that they really need all the guidance they can get  for people who don t know toffler, can you give a little context?''kevin kelly  yeah  so alvin toffler wrote a book called future shock in the  70s or  80s  i don t remember where it was  but he, in some ways, for a long time was the most famous futurist  and even people who didn t know what he was talking about knew him as a futurist  so if you knew about a futurist, it was alvin toffler, even though you hadn t read his book  i have the same thing in china where people might recognize my name and call me a futurist, even though they have never read anything by him  so alvin toffler s book future shock is still worth reading ''he was the one who introduced the term  future shock  which was that people would actually have like a resistance or a reaction to the future, in general, just because things were changing fast  but he also invented, in that same book or the next one, the idea or the term  prosumer   which is a person who is both producing and consuming, which we now call user generated content  but this idea that most of this economy would be prosumers  that was his idea in like the  70s or  80s, so he was way ahead  that s incredible ''kevin kelly  yeah  how do you see china changing in the next 10 to 20 years?''kevin kelly  i believe that china is within five years on the cusp of actually having a global brand of something that everybody in the world would want  meaning a nike, a fill in the blank ''kevin kelly  yeah exactly, whether it s a car or a drone, or a camera, or some appliance, or device, or digital thing that would be world class in its innovation, in its quality ''like sony became eventually for the japanese  the reason why i think that is because, as you said, i go there a lot  i m going there probably every three months  i m not just going to the big cities, which i do my talks at, but i will always take an extra week or two and go out to the hinterlands  out to yunnan or guangxi or some other province  i spent some time on the silk road way in the west, where it s muslim, to get a sense of the other china and to gauge the depth of their dream  what do the chinese want? they are going so fast, where are they aiming for? what they are trying to do is innovate  they are coming to the west to learn how to innovate ''i think like we taught the japanese how to do quality  the japanese said, how do we do quality? so they went to taylor and all these guys gave them a list of  do this and do this, and do this, and you ll have quality   the japanese went through their list, they did it, and then they became the world s expert on making quality  the chinese are saying, how do we do innovation? all the people from the west,  you need to have science fairs and you have to have innovation hubs  you have to have start ups  you have to have all this stuff ''so they re going down the checklist  we re going to do that, we re going to do that, we re going to do that  i think they are doing it and they are going to succeed in making something that we all want  i don t know what it is, but i feel that they re really doing all the things that they wanted to do, although there are two cultural characters that they haven t yet gotten to ''and those two cultural ones are that they haven t yet embraced failure and they still don t collectively question authority enough  they re working on those and they know that they have to do those and they know that those are difficult to do collectively  individually of there s no problem  the chinese come to america, they can do all of this  but collectively as a culture, those are challenging for them  they re working on them  it ll be some more years but i think they will do it  now if you look at, let s say singapore, i know we are getting pretty china focused here, but as a sidebar you were talking about visiting these sort of far flung corners of china  china   just for those people who are listening who haven t been   is a lot more diverse than you might think  in fact, when you hear chinese, the language for instance, like mandarin chinese   it s basically beijing dialect chinese  on top of that, if you were to go to china, there are many ways to say chinese depending on where you are ''it indicates a lot of how you feel  so you could say like  speaking chinese  like center, the center county, middle kingdom language  then you can also say like  speaking chinese  so the language of the han people who are the dominant ethnic group ''kevin kelly   speaking chinese    speaking chinese  if you go to taiwan  now the mainlanders hate that  if you say  speaking chinese  that means kind of like the mainland talk  i mean i m translating very liberally here  that, of course, really irks the chinese who view taiwan as a rogue province that is nonetheless still a part of them, much like quebec or something in canada  the other point that i was going to make, or question, rather, that i was going to impose is, if you look at singapore  singapore has tried with some success for at least i would say the last ten years to replicate silicon valley  they ve faced very similar cultural hurdles, but they have fantastic, at least my impression is, financial resources ''they have unilateral freedom to do whatever they want  they have a well educated population  they are very, very, very small, right? the sandbox is incredibly small  you can walk around singapore in a day and then you re like what am i going to do here? i need to go to malaysia to have a new meal  why will china differ? is it just the sheer number of people that they have to choose from or to filter from, from which you can find the michael jordans, the jeff bezos, the fill in the blank?''kevin kelly  absolutely, i think this is an arithmetic problem  i mean, 1 4 billion people  by the way there s like  3 billion north americans  there s a billion more of them  i think there definitely is a critical mass, a scale that the chinese have  it s almost translated into a momentum that you need and that you have this critical mass of people behind you doing ''you were mentioning the diversity, which singapore does not have as much of, but it does have a lot for being a little city, but not compared to china  you have a huge diversity in china, as you were saying  not just the language, but even ethnically, geographically  so i think they have all those necessary requirements, the requisite complexity that you would need to make something  but i would say two things  one is, if they attempt to make another silicon valley, i think that fails  there are network effects in all these things and the network effect says that the best get bigger ''and the bigger you get, the better you get  and the better you get, the bigger you get  so you have this sort of compounding acceleration  that means that there is only going to be one or two dominant players  by the way, ai is going to be a network effects phenomenon  social media is a network effect phenomenon  the kind of start up culture is a network effect phenomenon in a particular category  nso if they try to do a silicon valley for software, it will not happen  if they decide to take something, which i think they might, like robotics or aviation, or biotech, and really develop and grow to a sufficient scale, i think they could have an equivalent  right now they do have one in manufacturing  right ''kevin kelly  the pearl river delta area from guangzhou to shenzhen  hong kong that is, that is basically one they do the world s best manufacturing in china  it s not because it s the cheapest, it s because it s the best and they have this whole ecosystem, with thousands and thousands of suppliers and dynamic real time inventory control and this whole thing  they do have the silicon valley for manufacturing in that area, and they will continue to grow that and people are going there not because they re the cheapest, in some cases they aren t, but because they have the absolute best in manufacturing  how much of the   and this is for those people listening  kevin and i decided to wing it  we had a conversation prior to recording and this is just us talking about stuff that we re interested in  i ve been, over the last few weeks, discussing with folks visiting silicon valley and the origins of silicon valley, or trying my best to explain why silicon valley may have happened here and not elsewhere  how much of silicon valley do you think can be attributed to a handful of companies that just happened to land here, like fairchild or some of these semiconductor companies?''the inability to enforce non compete contracts in california, which i think allowed these people to then split off and form many other companies that might have stepped on their former bosses  territory or other? when somebody asks you why did silicon valley happen here, what do you say?''kevin kelly  so there are reasons why  there was actually a really good book on this by annalee saxenian, i believe her name was ''she studied route 128 around boston and silicon valley and compared the two  because route 128 actually had a little head start in this kind of tech world  why didn t they become the silicon valley?''tim ferriss  why didn t sand hill road kill them?''kevin kelly  yeah, and part of the reason  there s a number of different reasons, but one of them was because, i think you mentioned a couple but there s others  and that was silicon valley was so far from the west coast government, the d c  government that they   or the east coast government ''kevin kelly  excuse me, the east coast government, d c    that they had to find a whole bunch of different sources for funding  they invented the funding model  which 128 around boston was still locked into a lot of the government defense contracts  right ''kevin kelly  okay? so that was kind of the difficulty, but a liberation for silicon valley, where it was really divorced from the government hand outs or government subsidies, the government funding ''not completely, but enough to actually really develop this other, alternative way of financing things  venture capital ''kevin kelly  right, venture capital  i think psychologically there was this other division, this other kind of divorcing from the whole california story of no adult supervision, not asking for permission, which started with the  49ers and before  i think that also continued to influence the culture  so there was a cultural innovation  many people say that the greatest invention from silicon valley was not the transistor or software, it was this model  it was this innovation model  that is the kind of meta   the innovation model meaning the set of beliefs and maxims and so on that those people carried in their heads?''kevin kelly  exactly, right  the venture funding model, the startup model, this method, this culture that would reward ''the joke was you change your job and you walk across the street  and also the fact that you were encouraged to change your job  far from lifelong employment, but this idea that you ve been here a couple years, time to move on  so there was a whole bunch of things that are ingredients to that  this book studied this in a more economically rigorous way of why did one surpass the other?''tim ferriss  there s a number of fascinating documentaries on this as well and maybe it s all sort of hindsight logical, but in reality, 90 percent of it was just random collision of people and factors  i don t know ''kevin kelly  i would also recommend john markoff s book with this really trippy title called what the dormouse said  what the dormouse said ''kevin kelly  which is about the hippy origins of the personal computer industry  so there s a whole other strand which is very influential, which was the fact that the hippy generation embraced computers unlike the other technologies that they rejected ''and they embraced them from doug engelbart to steve jobs, to a lot of the ai guys  a lot of the people in the early computer industry had a little of the hippy background and they saw these things as augmentations, as basically it s kind of like a new age way to augment the human  so when people left the communes   they tried the communes, they didn t work  with the long hair  but they learned a lot of skills, including small business skills  making their candles, and their sandals, and their macram , selling honey or whatever it was ''so unlike people who went to college and never dropped out  who went to work for the big organizations, the ibm, they were at the craft fairs getting business skills ''then when they came along, they transferred those directly into this idea of small businesses which were not cool  if you told somebody in the  50s that you were at a startup that was a code for  i m unemployed, i was fired   it s like consultant right? oh, you mean unemployed  that was the analog ''kevin kelly  right  have you ever been to   i know i m jumping around here   but to christiania? i think it s in copenhagen ''kevin kelly  yes, in copenhagen  so there s this area   for people who haven t been   called christiania  i m pretty sure i m getting it roughly right  it s effectively like a hippy anarchist commune in the middle of or around copenhagen  there are gates that you walk through and it says here ends the european union when you walk through  and as you describe, it is people walking their kids around in wheelbarrows, making honey, and making candles  they have breweries  it s such a funky experience ''kevin kelly  it s a little autonomous region that started off as a squatter city that is now semi legal in some capacity and they do have their own little government at this point and it s quite extensive  you could spend   it s not as quite as big as singapore  it s not that far off ''kevin kelly  right  it s a worthy experiment to go visit because there are lots of alternative governments and structures  cultures are really important  let me just say one thing about travel before we go into other things  i travel a lot, not just to china but to other places, as much as i can because i find that it really keeps my mind flexible  in fact, i find that it s the most exercise i can do in a short amount of time than anything else  i mean sure i can learn a new language and do all these other things  i find you can do all of those while you re traveling too ''but travel really forces me to be flexible and to confront others and to think about things differently  even whether if i have a different idea there, it s just the habit of trying to think and come at things differently that i find really, really useful  in addition to the fact that you actually literally are looking at your own culture from a different lens but even just the general habit of trying to let go of what you think you know  i go to china above all else because every time i go, i actually have decided i know less than the last time ''there s so much happening there  it s happening so fast  it s so big, the chinese have no idea what s happening  i think i know something and then i go and i realize i don t know what s happening here either  i know less than the last time i visited  it s a different country than the last time you were there ''kevin kelly  right  i think travel is so important, particularly to young people that i really think it should be subsidized at the federal level  i think gap year should be mandatory ''kevin kelly  i think a two year national service should be a requirement and you can fulfill it anyway you want including going overseas and working at the peace corps or a visa or whatever it is  take two years  want to go do military? fine  want to go to an inner city? fine  you want to go overseas? fine  we ll pay you for two years  nothing would transform america as having an overseas experience for the majority of people who, by the way, don t have passports at this moment  i agree  i could not agree more  we agreed on a few other things earlier when we were talking about podcast questions and i was making some funky mushroom coffee, not of the psychedelic sort, that i ll describe some other time  but you suggested that i ask people about their email systems  how do they handle inbound email?''kevin kelly  right, because for ordinary people, they get a lot of email  but if you have any level or success or notoriety or prominence, dealing with the incoming in a sane way that actually works is a real mystery to me  people like yourself, or even the other people who get a lot of demands on them, how do you actually deal with email? do you have more than one account? if you have more than one account, how do you handle it? do you have your assistant involved?''tim ferriss  etc , etc , there are many different facets to it ''kevin kelly  right, right  and you mentioned you had a conversation with jeff bezos  i said we have to save that for the podcast  so now i have to ask, what was this conversation?''kevin kelly  so i had the opportunity to ask jeff at some point about his email  because i wanted to send something  i said,  who do i send it to, how do you do your email?  again, i think this is probably a ten year old answer  so i can t verify this is happening  but he said,  i finally figured out what to do  so here s is what it is, is anything you send to me,  and actually, his email is fairly well circulated  he says,  anything you send to me, my assistants will read and they are in charge of responding or doing something with it   right, vetting ''kevin kelly  no, to give the appropriate response   but i also read it all, and since i don t really normally answer it unless there is something  and then if there is something that i want to respond to, i ll respond to it  so the worst case scenario that you ll get two replies from me  from my assistant, if it needs to be replied to, and me   so in other words, everything goes in a parallel circuit  once to his assistants and they deal with what has to be (and most of it s probably going to be ignored)  those that need to be done something, they may nudge him or whatever ''and he s also looking at it, and he can reply personally to it  he said the worst is you might get two  that seemed to be   he has one email and i have gotten responses to that email, and sometimes it just goes and obviously he doesn t respond to it  into the ether ''kevin kelly  right  do you still have   this is something that i ve had to get increasingly better at because the tools and tactics as i laid them out, for instance, in the 4 hour workweek still work very well  however, i ve had to develop more nuanced layers on top of what i did because now it s thousands of emails coming and hitting me, my assistants, everyone  deciding how to vet and use tools like boomerang to schedule things to be set in the future or automatic follow ups, you name it, moving a lot of internal communication, the slack so it s separate from the inbox, etc  do you still have an assistant and a separate researcher?''kevin kelly  i do  i have an assistant and a full time researcher, but they don t do my mail, so i do all my own mail  what is your researcher currently helping you with, if you can talk about it?''kevin kelly  i would love to talk about it  in fact, we just had a review today  so i ve been working on a project  a review meaning that you reviewed  ''kevin kelly  we have an annual review  i have an annual review with the two people who work for me  so once a year we sit down and we do an employee review, we talk about the past year and evaluate what s coming up  her name is camille, and what camille is working on is we are gathering every long term forecast that we can find anywhere, in any of the industries or published anywhere  we re bringing them together and we re going to try to integrate all the long term forecasts into one integrated forecast of the future  long term meaning ten years or more  so forecasts could be anything from  this is how we see gasoline prices moving in the next 20 years,  to  this is how we anticipate air travel to the number of seats filled in air travel to move in the next 20 years  ''kevin kelly  right  and we re going even broader, like the future of sports, the number of attendees at sports game, transportation  we are going through the whole list of things  so she s been working on it for six months and we probably have another six months of what i call the  official future   having being trained in gbn, which was a consultancy that did strategy for global companies, the mantra was that  all predictions are wrong,  and generally, particularly official futures  so there s official extrapolation  you take what s been happening for the past five years and you extrapolate  they are invariably not correct, because things jig and jag and new things are invented that disrupt the pattern ''but my premise is that while they re wrong, that they re still useful  and they would be particularly useful if they were integrated together  so you would say the future of transportation looks like this and the future of electric cars looks like this and they both can t be right, they have to inform each other in some ways  so that s the next step of integrating and having these official futures inform each other and to see if i can make a scenario that s more useful out of the sum of the parts  so she has been working on that for six months ''she also did the research when i was doing the big cover story for wired on vr  so for five months i was trying out every single vr headset, input, content that i could and i wrote this article  and the way wired works, like other magazines, is they have this fact checking which is sort of in some way kind of a legal cover your ass thing  cover your ass thing ''kevin kelly  which means every single statement that i make has to be verified and proven  like a scholarly article, like a footnote, which is totally insane but that s what you have to do  so we were involved in   you say something that seems obvious to you, there s some statement    vr, people get sick in it, or they have motion sickness    can you prove that? where does that come from? how do you know about that?  so she did a lot of the hard legwork in finding the documentation for these kinds of statements that aren t footnoted in the article, but actually are footnoted in what i turn over to them ''so i have a completely scholarly footnoted article  people don t realize that, like behind the scenes of new yorker and wired and places like that, there is a huge amount of   there is a full time staff that will fact check every single fact  oh yeah  it s a big, dedicated staff ''kevin kelly  by the way, books do not do that and newspapers do not do that  yeah  we can spend a lot of time talking about all of that ''kevin kelly  so going back to my assistants  i have a researcher who does all that kind of research and anything else i need research on, which that s the main thing, but this was my one dream was to have somebody   this was even before google that i could ask   i do a lot of travel  so they sometimes do research on simple things, like is it a sane idea to rent a car in oman or should i get a driver? so you troll the tripadvisor boards  the state department,  inaudible  ''kevin kelly  it s just kind of looking around, yeah it s that kind of stuff  how do you decide aside from those types of logistics? how do you choose projects for your researcher to help you with? and you could delve into anything that you d like  so how do you choose?''kevin kelly  like projects in general? what am i going to do next?''tim ferriss  sure, yeah  how do you choose what you re going to do next?''kevin kelly  okay  so this has taken me a long time to get there, but one of the questions that i   well you have seen these venn diagrams of things you like to do, things that other people need?''tim ferriss  yeah ''kevin kelly  but for me, there is actually a third important circle  and that s not just things that i want to do, so that has to be a key thing that i m good at doing, that s the second thing  because there s lots of things i would have fun doing, but i m not good at  so they have to be things i m good at  and then there is maybe would be useful to other people  but this other circle that s become more important to me is, can anybody else do it?''tim ferriss  yeah, right ''kevin kelly  if somebody else can do it, i am not going to do it  i spend a lot of time trying to give away ideas and trying to talk about what i m doing in the hope that someone else comes along and says,  oh, i m doing that   that s like whew, what a relief because now i m not doing that  it s like i m talking about this future stuff   if i could find out someone else out there   they write to me and they say  i m doing that   i m like oh, my gosh, thank you  now i don t have to do that  and so what i m trying to look for is really good things that i would enjoy, that other people value, that nobody else is going to do ''that i can t convince anyone else to do  they think it s a terrible idea or they think it s a lousy idea, but for some reason i think it s a good idea and i can t get anyone else to do it  i can t talk  no one will steal it from me  you re trying to give it away and no one will take it ''kevin kelly  i m trying to give it away and no one s going to take it  it s like all right, i have to do that now  that s how i feel about books  so i get asked,  why don t you write a book on this? why don t you write a book on that?  i m like,  there are already plenty of good books on both of those subjects  ''kevin kelly  right  it has to be something that bothers me for so long, but seems like such a crackpot idea for everybody else, i can t buy it anywhere to scratch the itch  and i m like, okay, well  ''kevin kelly  that s me  just to fix that neurosis, i have to address it  so titles are important and you mentioned the title of a book just a few minutes ago before we started recording that caught my attention, because we were looking at the slow creep of books and piles on my table, which is ironically right next to this marie kondo book on the japanese magic of tidying up ''kevin kelly  let s be more accurate  the book about cleaning up is on a stack of other stuff  exactly  which i took a photograph of because it s a lot better than it was  it used to be like the trash compactor in star wars, and this book on japanese decluttering would just surf this wave of flotsam and jetsam around my house  it s a lot better now  but you mentioned that another book called all too much  ''kevin kelly  it s all too much, and it actually preceded her book at least in english  i thought it was so valuable, that in this really huge book i did called cool tools, i list it as the very first tool, which was how to deal with all this stuff, how not to have a bunch of stuff  i actually gave it a whole page because i thought the message was so profound  because it s not about tidying up and cleaning, he talks about the fact that if you have something that is valuable, you need to show it ''hiding things, if you have collections and they are not visible, then they are not working for you  he s not against collecting things, but if you collect them they have to be prominent  they have to bring you joy, they have to be doing something in your life  what you want with decluttering is to remove the junk so you have room for your treasure ''all these things where it s not about the stuff  it s about your mental state, your openness to new ideas  and the clutter is, in some ways, prohibiting your self fulfillment, the best you  because it s hiding, you re buried under it  there is this sort of   i wouldn t call it pop psychology   but it is a little bit about trying to get at the core of what you are about, what your house is about, what your life is about, and making room for these things, and the kind of that techniques he uses are very similar to what the japanese gal, i can t remember her name   kondo ''kevin kelly  kondo  which is you pick up something and does that object give you joy? actually, what she does is different  she says take everything in your house, and she goes by categories  put all your clothes in the center, make a big pile, and by default, you re going to get rid of all of them  but as you re going through, if you pick up something that gives you joy, that s what you keep ''everything else is just gone  the same thing about all your other possessions  category by category you decide they re all by default going to be gone, and you only retrieve those things that give you joy  that s a little bit what he s talking about in that same kind of profound way  i did try this  i gave it a good college try, and i did find certain aspects of it very helpful, but then the joy part   i picked up these printouts that were legal documents or tax returns and i m like, not joyful  this is not giving me joy  but it would be very neglectful and irresponsible of me to throw these out  now what, marie kondo? the topic of simplicity is one that i try to consistently return to because our lives tend to interrupt you, right?''kevin kelly  right  what books or resources have you found helpful for simplifying your life? and if that s not the right question, you can tackle it a different way ''kevin kelly  well i think it s all too much of this decluttering and her books are actually helpful in simplifying things  i am maybe not as big a fan of simplicity as you are  i think our lives are inherently more complex than our parents and our grandparents and our children and their grandchildren and future generations will be more complicated  i think that is generally the drift of this thing we call life and evolution and technology, and they re going to become more and more complicated ''i think right now some people are very upset over our kind of distracted manner or the way we skip through or surf through the nets and internet and social media  i actually think that a very sane response to the environment  where we have to scan because things are much more complicated and we ll do more scanning in the future ''i think maybe there s appropriate kinds of complexity  complications maybe we avoid and complexity is okay  the thing about life is that it surfs a very fine line between rigid order, which is death, and complete chaos  there is this edge of chaos, they call it  there is this edge where there s this particular kind of falling forward or particular kind of chaotic order, or orderly chaos, or something  i think it s not rigid simplicity and it s not just overly chaotic complications  there is a very fine variety of complexity that is not just healthy, but it is the source and the genius of health, wealth, and everything else that we want  so i think i might be able to ask a better question, which is, in face of the notifications and social media pings and so on and so forth, a lot of people feel anxious and they feel conflicted and over committed  maybe you just mask it really well, but i ve never had that feeling from you  i ve never gotten the impression that you feel those things  why not? are there particular rules or ways that you  ''kevin kelly  there is one thing and that is   and maybe this is kind of a zen thing  the zen mantra is  sit, sit, walk, walk, don t wobble   i haven t heard that before ''kevin kelly  yeah  so it s this idea that when i m with a person, that s total priority  anything else is multi tasking  no, no, no, no  so i have a priority ''the people to people, person to person trumps anything else  if there is anything else going on, whatever  i have given my dedication to this  if i go to a play or a movie, i am at the movie  i am not anywhere else  it s like 100 percent i am going to listen  if i go to a conference, i am going to go to the conference  that s true  i have never seen you on a device while with or near other people ''kevin kelly  right  now that i think about it ''kevin kelly  even at wired  i had the rules of if i m with a person to person and the phone rings   no, never  if i m on the phone and a notification rings   no, i m on the phone  so i think this sense of, and you can have a priority if you want, whatever it is  but it s sort of like i m going to give, i m going to be present, whatever that is, at that time and everything else we ll deal with it later   sit, sit, walk, walk, don t wobble  ''kevin kelly  right  what books have you found have given you   and i always come back to books (it doesn t have to be books   sources, something that people listening could look at themselves or listen to), have given you rules like that or maxims or sayings that have proved very useful?''kevin kelly  well, i come from religious tradition and i actually think some of the religious texts are very good for that  i think it s very hard to read the bible all the way through  by the way, i recommend that you do that at least once in your life  no matter who you are, sit down   well, it will take a long time  but read through the bible and read a modern version  it will take you some time  it is probably the most amazing thing you haven t read yet  it s highly disturbing, highly influential and whatever your opinion about it is, you re going to be wrong  whatever you think, whether you think it s the greatest   read it through it s an amazing book  i say the same thing about the koran  try to read the sufi stuff  there is nothing that i enjoy more than at night reading rumi  yeah ''kevin kelly  i mean it s just something about it  he s a sufi mystic from afghanistan who is a transcendent, thought leader maybe like seneca or something  he has tremendous wisdom  so i think the wisdom of the ancients, in general, have a lot to offer us and i think reading the zen parables, you know, the sound of one hand clapping, zen mind, beginner mind   these kinds of things  for me, that kind of wisdom   it s not like you have to slavish or obedient to them  take what you find useful, move on  but i found a lot of use in those texts  so we have in a sense these timeless philosophies and belief structures that can help us make better decisions and so on  then we have subject matter expertise of different types that can become more or less relevant over time ''we were chatting before we started recording about a question that i get asked all the time  which is, what industry should i be paying attention to in the next three to five years? what skills should i learn? and most of these are business focused   but what skills should i learn to be able to take advantage of new, non obvious industries in the next 10 to 15 years?''kevin kelly  right  you mentioned, and i might be getting the wording here off, but sort of tech literacy?''kevin kelly  techno literacy  techno literacy, different types of literacy, can you elaborate on that ''kevin kelly  right  so let me put it, again, into a little bit of context  i ll talk a bit more, but let me just preface and say that i do talk a bit about this in my new book called the inevitable  yeah, i have one of the few copies right here in front of me ''kevin kelly  tim has one of the first copies off the press  it s talking about the next 20 to 30 years, mostly about digital technology and the trends that i consider non negotiable, inevitable in the sense that there is not much we can do about it ''there s a lot we can do about the specifics, but i don t know about the bigger trends  they are coming whether we want them to or not  the inevitable subtitle,  understanding the 12 technological forces that will shape our future  ''kevin kelly  right  and one of the first chapter talks about this question of skills  i think that the specifics, like what language should i be learning in school? or what business skills should i have? i think what i think are more useful and what i counsel even my own kids about, are there are these mental level skills  the skills of learning how to learn, the skills of learning how technology, in general, operates, which is what i would call the techno literacy skills  an example of a techno literacy skill is that besides the initial purchase cost of the technology, whatever you buy you, you now have a maintenance cost ''that maintenance cost is making sure that it s upgraded or integrated, or just maintaining it in some capacity  so there are several levels of the cost  it s not just how much does it costs to buy, how much does it cost to maintain in your life  there s a price to dealing with it when it breaks down, upgrading  it s sort of like owning a boat, a little bit  it s not the initial cost of the boat, it s the maintenance that really is the costly part  and the same thing with anything that we buy  so if you get something into your house, there is now a relationship with that thing  it s like having a pet or an animal or something  you have to deal with it and its interaction with other things  that s just an elementary thing  there is also a negative cost too, in terms of whatever it is that we have, there is going to be some downside  journalists are usually pretty good about identifying  you should pay attention to what people say about the negative aspects of it because they are real ''it s not that they should discourage you from using the technology, and i ll argue that it shouldn t, but we should be aware of them and willing in a certain sense to pay the price  what would be an example, a clear example to you of a technology with a downside that perhaps is underappreciated or downsides that are underappreciated?''kevin kelly  automobiles kill one million humans on earth every year  now imagine if we were going to introduce automobiles and say here are cars  it ll kill one million of us, do you want to drive it?''tim ferriss  not the best pitch i ve heard ''kevin kelly  i know, but that s what i m saying  i m saying there are all these hidden   but that s real and this is one of the reasons why i think driverless cars are going to   even though they will   here s the thing  the first driverless car that kills a person, people will go completely bananas, but we are killing one million of them ourselves  that s not registered for some reason  it s like, that doesn t count?''tim ferriss  yeah, they ve lost the reference point ''kevin kelly  exactly  so there is going to be driverless cars will kill some people, but they are not going to kill as many as we kill  so in evaluating that, in evaluating whether you want to get in   there are going to be, by the way, ethical issues with driverless cars because we give ourselves a pass when we have an accident  it s like, i didn t have time to react or i wasn t thinking  but the driverless car has to be programmed  and so you have to give it a preference  if there is an accident, do you give the passenger safety preference over the pedestrian?''tim ferriss  right  or do you give the three elementary school kids  ''kevin kelly  the trolley problem  exactly  the trolley problem  over the seven people who are 70 years old ''kevin kelly  right  so when you go to buy a car and volvo says,  we give passengers preference,  is that ethical?''tim ferriss  is the programming one of the selling points? you are 12 percent less likely to be sacrificed in compromising environments ''kevin kelly  exactly  so techno literacy is to like say we need to cognizant of this, if there s cost, if there s ethical dimensions to this  and there are other techno literacy skills, like the fact that you don t really want to learn a language, a programming language, you want to learn how to learn a language, because you are going to have to relearn it later on and you want to understand that when you buy something, it is immediately obsolete, right? it s always, by definition  so one of the things i recommend is you want to buy things five minutes before you need it not ever before  there is no sense in hoarding this stuff because it s just going to change just in time  just in time  just in case ''kevin kelly  exactly  so there are things, i think those kinds of skills are going to much more useful  i think i might have said this before, but when i was at wired and we were doing hiring, first of all i never looked at anybody s educational background  i looked at their experience  the model that i had in my head was you hire for attitude and the skills we ll train  we ll train for skills  i wasn t really hiring people for skill set per se, it was more of their attitude, their orientation, their techno literacy, their ability to learn and adapt  that was far more valuable than the particular skills they had  now at some level, skills play into it and sure, there is a certain skill requirement, but i think maybe as important is these other levels  now it makes me think of this, i think it s a bit from neil gaiman s commencement speech  make good art,  but he says at some point he realized that there are three important components if you want to keep a job ''it is get along with people, have people like you, deliver things on time, be good at your job  he said, the good thing is you don t really need all three, you just need two out of the three  if you have two out of the three, they ll keep you around  do things on time, have people like you, or be really, really good  he s like, you only need two of the three ''kevin kelly  do things on time is really great, but in terms of other people who are self starters, like if you don t have a job if you re trying to do something, the equivalent of that is to just do lots of it over and over and over again  i can t emphasize how important that doing it a lot is, because the only way to get through, the only way to find out what you re really good at or if no one else can do, is basically a lifelong project  you have to throw a lot against the wall and see what sticks ''kevin kelly  you have to do a lot and lot  the more failures you have, the more successes  it s a really, very clear ratio that s linked  you just have to do a lot  that s the only way you can find out what you re good at  because how many college kids, young people coming out, they say  i don t have a passion  i don t know what i m good at   the only way that i know to find out your passion is to actually work to it by trying lots of stuff and becoming expert at something  right  well, in a way this might sound clich d, but instead of discovering yourself, you re creating yourself  these kids (kids   i sound like such an old man) but these young people who graduate from college and then they want to sit down and journal for ten minutes or take multiple choice tests to figure out their myers briggs and have their kind of assignment for passion  i m like, that s not how this works  you re not a block of ice that is being chipped away to reveal the sculpture underneath ''you re actually just a small piece of clay and all the other bits and pieces need to be added  there is a kernel of it that is you, but you need to construct that and the way you do that is by doing these experiments and trying x, y, and z and everything else in between  i still feel like i m doing that ''kevin kelly  i m still doing that  i m almost 65  i m still doing that  and the people that i respect the most in my circle are still doing that  they are still asking themselves at 70 years old, what i am going to do when i grow up? i mean, it s like who am i? what am i here for? should i be doing this? and that s actually why i respect them so much because they are still constructing their life rather than discovering it or finding it  they are constructing it and i think that s a really wonderful metaphor  you said a while back when we were just putzing around in my living room looking at the living wall and what not  you said there are no vr experts ''kevin kelly  right  so i wrote this big cover story in wired about vr, and a couple years ago i wrote about ai and, by the way, these are the kinds of things that are in my book, the inevitable, where i m looking at these things which are coming  ai is coming in a big way, vr is coming  the particulars of how it arrives, who owns it, how it s structured   those are not inevitable, those are not predictable  they make a lot of difference to us  so we have a lot of choice in this thing  but one of the things i want to emphasize is that right now, basically, there are no vr experts  it s completely open  really, we (collectively) humans have no idea how vr is going to work, what content will really work best in vr, what the necessary amount of equipment will be, what that consumer breakthrough version will be ''even though there is vr today, the vr today is good enough improve  so it hasn t been good enough to improve but now today with the oculus and the vive and this other stuff, it s now good enough to improve for reasons i can talk about  it will improve very fast, but there are no experts  so that means that a person out there listening to this, could easily become a vr expert, okay? there are really no ai experts  there are a lot of people working on ai, but compared to what we ll know in 20 years from now, we don t know anything  so it s actually not that difficult to become an ai expert  so let s say someone listening said, you know what? i ve read about vr  this is really exciting  i m tired of my comparative literature major  i d like to switch gears and really immerse myself ''what would you suggest they do? if they seemed earnest, intelligent, they were committed, they were like i want to become a vr expert or ai, you can take your pick ''kevin kelly  yeah  there was a guy, kent bye, who runs the voices of vr podcast  two years ago, he quit his job and has interviewed 400, he s done 400 interviews of almost every person working in vr  that s his job now is he just does interviews of the voices of people working in vr  he s doing the journalistic side  i would say it s very easy, which is you purchase some gear and you start making vr  you actually do it  you buy or you get a pair of google vr, cardboard, which you can get for free  use your phone and start making vr ''you ll learn more about it than reading about it, than working, whatever it is  try to make a vr experience  make something for five minutes  the issues are incredible  there s lighting issues, there s continuity issues  we don t even have a vocabulary for editing  like in cinema we have syntax of what a cut is  right ''kevin kelly  how do you do a jump, a dissolve  a panning shot of x, y, and z ''kevin kelly  we don t have any of that  none of it really works in vr  it doesn t mean the same thing  so someone has to invent all of those  the interface, the mouse  there is no mouse for vr  there are people who have invented it, but there is nothing that has worked like windows and the mouse that engelbart made  so there is so much that has to be invented and that somebody who just decides that they re going to work at this every day or every day on weekends or whatever it is, can make a huge advance  i think you ll need to do it because you love it  because this is not economics  we re talking about investing into mastery  i was having a chat with marc andreessen recently and he said, what did he say? i just had a complete mental blank  i need more tea  he said a lot of very interesting things  you will hear about them another time because i just had a complete premature alzheimer s moment so that s going to have to be a footnote for later  what are you most excited about right now?''kevin kelly  i m going to take that in the professional sense  you can take it in any sense  no, i really mean that ''kevin kelly  well, in the personal sense, i m still very excited about asia  asia is the culmination for me of the future ''you asked me before about   i go to china to hear what the future will be and also because i have a love for the asian traditions that are disappearing very fast and i m trying to record them  so i go to asia to photograph these disappearing traditions, ceremonies, and what not  tim was just joking that i came back from kerala, india, where i was photographing these massive elephant precessions that the temples have, with 40 elephants parading through and all kinds of ceremonies  i don t know how long they can continue that ''it s a very expensive, elaborate spectacle, not just in one place but throughout the rural areas  it s like other areas that as they become modern, some of these traditions become hard to hold onto  i m not nostalgic about wanting to keep them or protect them, i just want to record them, because i think they will go away ''so that excites me  i m working on another book, and that s personally something i love to do for joy  that s the only reason  just because i love to record and document these things and see them  but the other thing i m excited about in the world of the future is ai  i can t overestimate or over enthuse on the disruptive nature that i think ai will be in the broadest sense  many people use analogies and i have several analogies, but the one that maybe would make sense to most people was the industrial revolution was this huge thing from the world of agriculture, where we used our own physical muscles and the muscles of animals to get things done ''and then we had this thing where we automated that with artificial power, artificial electric power, and steam power, and later gasoline power  this is artificial animal power, artificial human power that we used to make our lives so much easier and so much different  everything our whole lives   in fact this house has been built using this automated power  imagine if you had to make it by hand  it s just insane we couldn t do it  so all these motors and the harnessing of that power propelled this industrial revolution in the modern world that we have  150 years ago, farmers would take an item, like a hand pump, and say we ll make it electric ''so they took things and they electrified them  what we are doing now, we re at the very beginning of it, is we re going to take all the things that we electrified and we re now going to cognify them  we re going to add intelligence to them ''everything   and not just things that are electric, but even inert things, like a chair, like the door  people laugh, or they say you re going to put a computer in a door? 20 years ago or 30 years ago  yes, go to a hotel today, there is a computer in your door, there is a little card reader  so we re just going to keep adding this and it s going to get smarter and smarter in multiple different ways  so that intelligence, what i call artificial smartness, is not human intelligence  it s like artificial power  it s like synthetic learning  it s just very specific, narrow, brute force kind of intelligence  so while we can think of our lives as having   when you drive a car, it s what? 240 horse power? you have 240 horses at your disposal ''then we are going to do the same thing with ai like you re going to have like 250 minds right here to do whatever it is that you want to think about or solve  you just hire this  and so it will be like electricity in the sense that you re not going to make the ai, you re going to buy it from the cloud  it will be like amazon web services ''kevin kelly  exactly  in fact, google is selling their ai  you can purchase ai from google today  and that s what we ll do, yes    60 cents per thousand instances  really?''kevin kelly  yes  google ai can do amazing things, like it can look at a picture and tell you what s going on in that picture  and you can actually ask it questions  you can say what s that person wearing? what color is that hat? what are they doing with it? and then it will tell you back     60 a thousand  so what would your response be to those who have fear of the rise of the machines? skynet and creating the summoning of demons that we can t control, etc  how would you respond to that or comment on it?''kevin kelly  i would say first of all, it s possible but very unlikely  why do you say that?''kevin kelly  a lot of reasons  one is that the general trend is that automation, including this ai, will create more jobs than it destroys  it will take a lot of jobs away  i think in 20 years, at least 50 percent of the people driving trucks will no longer drive trucks  and by the way, truck driving is the most common occupation in the us  i did not know that ''kevin kelly  so 50 percent of those won t have jobs  especially long haul trucks and stuff like that  so there will be jobs  i like to think that there are tasks that are going to be taken away  so automation, including white collar tasks like mortgage, people working in banks all this kind of stuff, anything  if you have a job that s defined by productivity or efficiency, that s a job that is going to go to ai  so productivity is for robots, okay?''tim ferriss  yeah ''kevin kelly  productivity is for robots  what humans are going to be really good at are asking questions, being creative and experiences  so almost everything in our world right now is becoming cheaper and cheaper in cost  the few things that are increasing in cost are all experience based   tickets to a concert, tickets to hamilton, and tickets to travel, personal coaching, nursing care, and weddings  those are the things going up in price because they re not commodifiable, they re not able to be manufacturable   they are experienced based  they re not efficient  science is terribly inefficient  you re not learning anything unless you re making mistakes  that s inefficient by definition  innovation is inherently inefficient, so we will move to those things, and they don t all have to be highbrow ''again, nursing care, being a companion for someone, giving them attention, giving them an experience, so there is a big room there  but i think we re going to move away from things that are being measured in terms of efficiency because anything that s concerned with efficiency, whether its white collar, knowledge work, or physical work, goes to the robots  what has been the most impressive vr experience or profound that you ve had?''kevin kelly  so this is a good question, because i saw them all and i saw  the secret of magic leap,  which had a really good visual representation, but it turns out   magic leap being augmented reality?''kevin kelly  they call it mixed reality, because it s the kind where you have a clear glass that you re wearing  like google glass, but you have a full vision and there is synthetic or an artificial object or a being or something in your vision  so we could be looking around this room and i will have these glasses on and i could see either a virtual screen, or a virtual tea cup, or a virtual book, or a virtual animal and it would look   it would be really present  for people who want to just get a sample of this, i m sure you could just google it, but there is also a really, i thought, a good piece written by chris dixon on  what s coming next in computing,  i think was the title, the headline, and there is a little animated gif of magic leaps ''kevin kelly  magic leaps, right  a demonstration of this little sort of, it looks like a japanimation robot hanging out under someone s desk ''kevin kelly  desk, right  it s very vivid and i saw the robot and so there are several things about where it doesn t work  where they have to improve is that object is not lit in the same way as the rest of the room, so there is a little mismatch  to light that thing and render it in real time with the light in the room   we are way off on that  so what you have is you have an artificial thing that s really there  it s like having a cartoon thing  you know it s not really real but it really is there  it s like who framed roger rabbit ''kevin kelly  yeah, but that s very useful  if you re designing a prototype and you can actually walk around and you can have a virtual screen  so they talk about this being the  last screen  because within it, if you wear these goggles you can have virtual screens that are very highly detailed  i could watch an hd movie in it without any discomfort at all  so you can have as many screens as you want and you re interacting with them  but you just take off the goggles and they re gone  which means you can also make them appear anywhere you want  so this is the future of work and you can actually have teleconferencing, which is another thing were you have a virtual person next to you  that is amazing and it s something i would pay, i don t know, thousands of dollars for right now if i could have that  so were you, in general then, does that mean more impressed by the augmented reality, or mixed reality than virtual reality?''kevin kelly  augmented or mixed reality is the more difficult of the two to do, and if you can do mixed reality, you can do vr just by turning the lights down, making it black  so technically, vr is a subset of the mixed reality  understood ''kevin kelly  okay? so the visual accomplishment of magic leap is there but that wasn t the most amazing experience that i had  it turns out that the visual is only 50 percent of your sense of experience  it s the tactile  it s the audio and the feeling, and using your hands and your body  the best experience i had that was really amazing was something called the void, based in utah  they are making an arcade version on vr, where they provide all the equipment and you go in and you pay for an experience, say for a half an hour  you pay  30 00 for 30 minutes ''and you go in and they re going to give you a full vest  you re suited up and it s amazing  it really is because they mix the real and the virtual  so let me give you an example  there s something called redirected walking  the way redirected walking is, is imagine you have your goggles on  you see something inside and you turn 90 degrees, a hard 90 degree turn to the right  but what you ll see is only an 80 degree shift  they are cheating you 10 degrees  and they can compound that cheat so that you think you re walking in a straight line for a mile across this amazing city scape  oh, but they have you going in a slight arc ''kevin kelly  but you re going in a circle  okay, that s wild ''kevin kelly  you re going in a circle and you don t know that  and they can do redirected touching, where you re grabbing things and you think you re grabbing different things, but it s the same thing  or even stairs that you think you re walking up the stairs, but it s just stairs that are cycling through  like they re rotating ''kevin kelly  right  so they are able to give you a 30 minute, where you re exploring this incredible thing, and it s just a little tiny room  wow ''kevin kelly  okay? and here s the other cool thing they did in this  so you re wearing this vest, this haptic vest that s vibrating and doing all kinds of stuff  they had you go up this elevator and you re on the second story and it s kind of like this indiana jones demo that i saw  and there is this floor right before you and it s rocky and it s not very stable and you need to get across and you re walking across and you fall down two stories  and what happens is that you re on a platform that moves six inches, but you have just fallen two stories, okay?''tim ferriss  wow  that sounds terrifying ''kevin kelly  well no, it s exhilarating  so does the floor just drop out from under you like cartoon style?''kevin kelly  yeah  and then you re floating for a second and then you drop?''kevin kelly  yeah, exactly  oh, my god ''kevin kelly  well, the point of all this is   i hope they have great waivers ''kevin kelly  the point of all this   because in only moves six inches  the point of all this is that there are all these tricks to what we assign our own believability of what is real, where we are  just like cinema exploits a trick of our vision  you think mickey mouse, which is not a real character, is throwing a baseball, and you see that ball as really moving across the screen but there is no movement right? there is only a series of still images that we can assemble in our brain  vr is exploiting that similar set of new discoveries so our bodies believe that these things are happening  our minds know  well it s like going from optical illusions to full body sensory illusions ''kevin kelly  exactly  and this turns out to be very important  so what i say is and what i discovered from looking at this vr, is that we are moving from an internet of information where you can get any information anywhere in the world  anybody who lives anywhere can have all the information they want, to an internet of experiences  these are very powerful experiences  so it s not just the experience of horror or falling, but all kinds of other experiences that we re going to have  and when you re there, you come out of these vr and it s not that you remember seeing something, you remember something happening to you  it s a much different presence  in fact first person shooter games turn out to be a little too emotionally exhausting when you re in vr  they produce ptsd if it gets real ugly ''kevin kelly  yeah  there was this vr documentary of going to a pig slaughter, and you re in the shoot with the pigs  oh, god ''kevin kelly  people said i could watch that but i can t   go through it ''kevin kelly    go through it  i can t be in there  there was another demo someone had and it was called killing the alien where you have to stab this alien being  but there s haptics involved and stuff  what do you mean by haptic?''kevin kelly  haptic is this term for tactile, of sense, touch  got it ''kevin kelly  they call it haptic technology and it means that when you grab something there is a response to it, or you can feel it  right, there s a resistance or texture ''kevin kelly  there s a texture and there s a lot of work into how do you get that sense that you ve grab something or you can feel something  how far do you think we are from vr sex?''kevin kelly  well, let me tell you  i had a great one last night  well, there s teledildonics  teledildonics   where you can remotely control various sex apparatuses ''kevin kelly  i saw these guys who have a technology for what s called volumetric capture, 3 d volumetric capture  i m getting all sorts of terrible images in my head ''kevin kelly  right  so volumetric capture is   they use like seven or more cameras to record a person in all their detail, so that when you see them in vr, they re moving around and you can see every single hair  so i have been volumetrically captured before ''kevin kelly  live or just a snapshot?''tim ferriss  it was a still ''kevin kelly  that s the difference  this is not a still  no, understood  but even the still was eerie because it was exactly me  it was mapped with   if you zoomed in you could see these tiny little grids and it was like, whoa, okay ''kevin kelly  right  so the volumetric capture of live movement is amazing because   and you re in a 3 d presentation of it  i felt uncomfortable even getting close to that person ''like you re in their space  you react to it  you really feel like they re there  if they re giving it eye contact and a voice, you have a total   like again, going back to the body, maybe your mind says they are not really there but your body is saying they are there, that s them  it turns out that second life is now doing a vr version called sansa  it s a thousand times better than the old second life because those avatars are getting their body language from that person  they are getting the voice and they have the eye contact  even if their avatar is not exactly them, you can still see them with their voice and their body movements and their micro expressions, they re really there  when do you think the haptic technology will be at a point where  ''kevin kelly  okay we are back to sex?''tim ferriss  yeah, oh yeah  dating in san francisco is a real pain in the ass  i could skip the pleasantries and just have  ''kevin kelly  well, the reason i mention the volumetric capture, as i was saying, this is amazing  i was saying, sex, right? they were saying  those are the first people who had come to us  all the porno  they were the first  we have got to have that   i think i ve heard that pornhub actually has a vr channel now or something  it wouldn t surprise me  it s the most popular website in the world that no one admits to going to ''kevin kelly  right  they have been way ahead in terms of their use of video grammar, the summaries, and stuff like that  so i haven t seen it personally, but i think that to answer your question, i m sure that right now there are probably one or two places that have probably put this together  so if you were a betting man, if you had to be  would you say available to those who can afford it in five years?''kevin kelly  absolutely, less than five years, absolutely less than five years  the void is, i think they re already opened  it s here  to outfit your whole body like this, it s doable now  i think this is going to be   things are going to be mostly regulated by economics and then the law, like where this is going to   yeah, things are going to get really, really messy ''kevin kelly  like is there someone on the other end, or is this a simulation, is this ai?''tim ferriss  right  are there like actors like the diamond age by neal stephenson? are they people who are outfitted with their own haptic suits who you re interacting with? in which case, which types of laws apply?''kevin kelly  right and if you re in different states  i think this will be a very sticky problem  nice  what are people worried about right now that you think they shouldn t be worried about? the only reason i ask  ''kevin kelly  that they shouldn t be worried about? i think the idea of the ai taking over and killing us all, cross that one off  i think they shouldn t be worried about gmos, cross that one off  they should not be worried?''kevin kelly  they should not be worried about gmos  we genetically modify all the crops that you re eating  we do them in different ways  we do it through breeding or whatever it is, but they ve all been modified  actually, if you want to modify the crops, modifying their genes with crispr is a lot better than trying to modify then with breeding because with breeding you have no control over what happens  it is a much more elegant process  so crispr you re not concerned about?''kevin kelly  no  there are things i am concerned about  in fact, i just saw a documentary last night which will be released pretty soon it s called zero days ''the theme of it   it s very well done, not sensational   it looks at the stuxnet virus, which was a computer virus that was invented, developed by the us and israel to demolish the uranium processing centrifuges in iran  the message is, they were looking at can you really destroy physical things with a computer virus? the answer is yes, you absolutely can  we are at the point where you can actually affect the physical infrastructure with computers  then the question is, what the rules are for that? and is that an act of war?''tim ferriss  like the geneva convention ''kevin kelly  right  and it turns out there are no rules  and yet, the us and others are developing these technologies and nobody wants to talk about them because they re all classified and therefore, no one wants to admit to it  therefore, you can t even have a conversation about it ''and yet iran retaliated  they made the largest cyber army in response to the efforts to take them down, which did not work in the end  so there already is cyber warfare going on, but it s not being talked about, it s not being admitted  the us government won t talk about the offensive  there are all the other countries that are now building capacity  and what are the rules? is it okay to disrupt the banking system? there s going to be collateral damage  what s accepted? i think that we don t have any rules for cyber war is something i m really worried about  yeah  i remember at a conference a few years ago, this very well respected technologist got up and talked about precisely this, cyber warfare and some of the scarier scenarios and the potential tactics that could be used ''for instance, if there were a natural disaster in san francisco and people went to google (assuming there was still internet connectivity) to try to determine how to respond  if someone could initiate the disaster somehow and then also figure out a way to present certain search results that were misinformation, maybe even more elaborate than is necessary  like maybe that s the 007 bad guy, like  i m going to leave you here with this sophisticated laser set up while i go have a sandwich  mr  bond, i ll see you in 20 minutes,  and then he gets away?''maybe it s a lot simpler than that  maybe it s taking out electrical grids with different types of viruses or electromagnetic pulse weaponry  or, for that matter, i ve been astonished at how vulnerable a lot of this stuff is to just long range marksmanship, for instance  it s like old technology applied to an increasingly fragile, in some capacities, internet of things ''kevin kelly  right, exactly  so when you introduce ai into that, as the us pentagon has just got some funding to have ai do this kind of stuff  to weaponize ai, basically  i m also worried about that  kill decisions, this idea of right now we have legally mandated assassinations in the us  we have assassinated us citizens, okay?''tim ferriss  can you elaborate on that?''kevin kelly  with the drones  got it ''kevin kelly  the drone program will take out a declared individual  we killed what s his name? he was an american citizen in yemen, i guess? and they targeted him and they killed him  there was no trial  there was nothing  so we now have assassination  but these drones usually have people back in nevada steering them ''and they usually have generals and there s a whole chain of command involved in the kill decision  but increasingly there is pressure to expand this kind of warfare because you don t have to have troops on the ground  the american public seems much more sympathetic to sponsoring warfare this   and as that increases, there is a need to have autonomous  so there s a very long feedback loop to come back and have humans decide on this or that  if you could have autonomous ai driven drones that didn t need that, then they could actually be making these decisions  that s scary  that s very scary  do you think just because this is also a topic of common debate in silicon valley in the ai circles  there were some people who say if you look at deepmind or some of these other ai focused groups in the us, they have ethics committees  they are collaborating with one another to look at safeguards  the real people you need to be worried about are sort of the fast moving solo acts in places like china  in places like fill in the blank, who do not have that safety first mentality  and people would argue that maybe that s not the case in the us either in certain places  but if someone is going to cause a big mess with ai, what are the characteristics of that?''kevin kelly  ai is still so early in it that i wouldn t hazard a guess, but i do acknowledge and i would emphasize that this is a global enterprise, and the chinese are very keen on making ai ''the three ingredients you need for ai these days are these deep neural nets, like deepmind  and then you need huge farms of gpus, graphical processing units, which have been commoditized but the video game industry  like in video chips ''kevin kelly  it turns out there are parallel processors that are really affordable  so before, ai was done on super computer parallels that would cost millions and millions of dollars  then it turns out that these little video chips that you make for video games were parallel processing and they were really cheap  so now they buy these big farms of these cheap video game processors  so you need lots of those  and then you need big data  big data is sort of the rocket fuel  so the companies like baidu and alibaba, who have big data, are actually able to do this kind of ai right now  i think there s no monopoly on ai right now ''china, europe, even japan, will all get into this business and i would expect, just given history, that there will be a disaster, an ai disaster of some sort  i mean it s inevitable, right? it s not to say that ai shouldn t be pursued  it s just like anything else ''kevin kelly  someone will abuse it  if you re going to have large scale water projects, there s going to be some horrible flood that ll kill a bunch of people or a fill in the blank disaster ''kevin kelly  right  so we have to be ready for that and not freak out about it, which is what i think one of the tendencies will be  okay, stop ai, research, no more federal funding ai  that will also happen, too  people will respond to that by saying we have to stop ai  if you had to again, sort of play nostradamus a little bit, what do you think the first few big wins of ai will be? where people will really step back and go, whoa ''kevin kelly  yes  it s going to be, well, two things  i think there will be these huge big wins  but what s very curious about this is that whenever these wins happen, as they have in the past, then immediately we don t call it ai  ai is only what we can t do  what we hope to do is called ai, and once we do it, it s called machine learning  so the first big win will be a translation  we ll have a little device that we can wear in our ear and it will hear you speaking chinese and it will whisper to me english  we ll have that in, i don t know, five years or so  but we re not going to call it ai  no, that s not ai  they re just dumb computers doing this stuff  it s no longer ai  people don t think of siri as ai  that s just machine learning  it s just siri ''kevin kelly  driving the car   that s no longer ai  of course computers can drive a car  of course they can play chess  because once it happens, it s like of course  that s obviously not ai  ai is always what we can t do  so there will be these wins like perfect translation  that will be very common  and talking to these assistant bots  that s the other thing  you ll have these conversations   let s do this, do that, echo  i was going to say it sounds a lot like early innovation of echo ''kevin kelly  right, okay  is that ai? do people think of it as ai? no, that s not ai, that s just echo, whatever it is  so i think that conversation is the interface mostly to ai for a very long time and we will get really good at that  i think people will ignore it  it will become invisible to them  i think most of the ai will be invisible, like we were talking about amazon web services  it s going to be behind the scenes, it s going to be very particular  i mean right now, your calculator is smarter than you are in arithmetic  it doesn t freak you out, right? right? it s great ''google is better than you in recall  so we have this very specific artificial smartness and that s where a lot of this is  most of the ai is not like human intelligence  that is why we are making it  the whole point is to think different, to make things think differently than us  the reason why we want these ai to drive cars is because they aren t driving like humans  they aren t worried about whether they left the stove on or having an argument with the garage  they are just driving better than we can drive  so we ll make a lot of the stuff that does things that are not   i mean, like when google is remembering all the webpages in the world, that s inhuman ''it s not anything we can do  so a lot of this stuff will be   and once we see the machines doing it, we ll say well, obviously, we weren t the only ones who could do that, but now it s all in retrospect  right  do you, and this is a total left turn, but do you journal? is that a practice that you have or not really?''kevin kelly  it s an occasional practice and something that i do occasionally at night, late at night  when do you do it? meaning what triggers it? what are the occasions that you decide to journal?''kevin kelly  i m trying to figure out  i haven t been able to determine the trigger, but sometimes i ll just be seized with this kind of, i need to sit down and just journal stuff and write stuff and doddle  i haven t been able to detect a pattern, but i have a book that i use and it s called late night ''i usually do it late night, very late and just kind of i don t know  maybe there is a buffer that gets filled or something  you have to unload it  you have to delete the download folder ''kevin kelly  right, exactly  start up disk almost full  better get this into my journal  what change in your life or behavioral modification are you proudest of in the last year or recent memory? and which habits or behaviors are you trying to change?''kevin kelly  good question  i think i m working on  i was mark zuckerberg who had this kind like he was going to give a thank you note every day for 30 days or something  so this idea of consciously really trying to express gratitude in a disciplined way is something i have been working on to try to make it more of a habit  how do you express gratitude? is it a phone call? is it a text message?''kevin kelly  generally, it has been an email  i m not a phone person  i don t like voicemail  i don t like talking on the phone  i came into my professional life   i was basically noticed online in writing short, telegraphic, email ish stuff  so for some reason, email is my medium and i m most comfortable with email  so gratitude  well, on that note, i want to thank you for taking time to have yet another jam session  i always have a blast  what are you up to right now? what would you like people to check out? where can they find you?''kevin kelly  so i have this book that will be released june 6th  it s called the inevitable  published by viking  it s, i think, a pretty good outline of the technological trends for the next 20 or 30 years at the highest level  things that we can t ignore and that we really should be embracing  i think if you are interested in what s coming, that you will really find it very useful because it s not really technical  it s at a high level  and if you re looking to where things will be in 20 years, i think i have a pretty good map of where that s going  so where can people grab it? i m sure by the time they hear this, they can grab it on amazon  and where else? kk org?''kevin kelly  yeah, so kk org is my homepage and where i hangout  and there ll be links if you want other languages or the audible version, the kindle  i think that it all should be listed there and i may even have a calendar ish thing going and where i m going to be  showing what you re up and speaking engagements or whatever ''kevin kelly  right, and in july i m going to be doing a bunch of stuff, basically appearing on a gazillion podcasts  i ve dedicated that for the month of july  this is why i like to do mine early ''kevin kelly  yes, exactly  another exclusive tim ferriss show opportunity ''kevin kelly  this is an exclusive  i m so delighted, tim, that you reached out and made the invitation to be at your glorious home  i m thrilled to have you here ''kevin kelly  i hope that it was useful to the listeners out there because we did kind of go all over the place  that s why they come  they come for the ocd plus the adhd with a dash of hopefully, definitely intelligence from my guests, and occasionally a glimmer of something approaching semi intelligence on my part  but everybody check out kk org  it s full of all sorts of things that i have recommended many times over the years, including  1,000 true fans,  of course and much more than that  the  quantified self,  everything can be found somewhere at the hub that is kk org  where on social media if somebody wanted to say hello would be the best place to say hello?''kevin kelly  i do look at the twitter stream and i m kevin2kelly  i have facebook which i don t look at as much  but actually, i do look at google plus  oh, you do?''kevin kelly  i do because i find that the comments and the conversation is very high quality  even though there s not that many people, those that are there are very active and i pay attention  so kevin kelly   if they just search kevin kelly on google plus?''kevin kelly  yeah, i m kevin kelly on google plus  perfect, all right  maybe we ll put that in the show notes  so everybody listening, you can find everything we ve talked about, assuming i can track it down, in the show notes at fourhourworkweek com podcast ''you can also find links to our previous conversations  we had two very fun conversations, where we went a lot into kevin s bio and asked a lot of my usual rapid fire questions that we ve already covered previously  you can find that and much, much more at fourhourworkweek com podcast  kevin, firstly thank you very much also for taking the time  i always have so much fun  and to everyone listening, as always and until next time, thank you so much for making the tim ferriss show a part of your daily podcast experience '"
239,247,Cool Tools for Travel with Kevin Kelly (#247),"'you can say hi to him on twitter  the number two, or go to kk org to see his writings, among others, 1,000 true fans, perhaps the essay i have recommended the most in the world to the most audiences ''kevin might be the real life most interesting man in the world  he sports an amish beard, he built his own house, he spends many months of the year traveling all over and i ve always wanted to travel with him  we recently had the chance to head to uzbekistan together, and i jumped at the opportunity  this episode covers some of our favorite travel tools ''so who is kevin? he is senior maverick at wired magazine, which he cofounded in 1993  he also cofounded the all species foundation, a nonprofit aimed at cataloging and identifying every living species on earth, and that is not a joke  in his spare time he writes best selling books, cofounded the rosetta project, which is building an archive of all documented human languages, and serves on the board of the long now foundation ''as part of the last, he is investigating how to revive and restore endangered or extinct species, including the wooly mammoth  and i guess that would not be part of the last  it would be part of the all species foundation  but you get the idea ''he s a busy, busy dude  his newest critically acclaimed book is the inevitable, subtitled  understanding the 12 technological forces that will shape our future  as journalist david pogue said of kevin,  anyone can claim to be a prophet, a fortune teller or a futurist and plenty of people do  what makes kevin kelly different is that he s right  he has an impeccable track record  ''this episode covers quite a bit of cool stuff, all very actionable  i hope you guys enjoy it  we had a blast recording it in the back of a car in the mountains  i will let kevin get to it  this is also being simultaneously published on his cool tools podcast, which you guys should check out and you can find it at kk org  enjoy!''mr  kelly?''kevin kelly  hi, this is kevin kelly  i m sitting in the back of a car crossing a mountain pass about 2,000 meters in the atintian mountains in uzbekistan ''uzbekistan is a central asian country that s generally south of russia, north of afghanistan and next to all the other  stans  like kazakhstan, turkmenistan, and tajikistan  sitting next to me as we cross the mountains, is tim ferriss, the legendary exploiter and explainer of world class performances  we re going to do a joint recording  tim is going to tell us about his favorite four cool tools, and we ll find out what he s up to lately  tim, why don t you tell us about your first cool tool?''tim ferriss  we re sitting in the back, here  we have bags around us, bottles of water, a bunch of different gadgets and objects piled in my lap  the first that i can talk about is actually in my other piece of luggage  i don t have any checked luggage, and it is a jacket that i roll up and travel with constantly ''it s from a brand called nau, n a u  i believe it s based in portland  you can think of it as a blazer or a riding jacket  what makes it unique is a number of different factors  a) you can roll it up and throw it onto a black tee shirt and you look like you re ready for a business dinner or a formal or semi formal occasions, so it saves me the trouble of packing a lot of collared shirts, for instance  there are collared shirts that don t wrinkle but they do take up more space than, say, a black tee shirt ''i have several different models at home  they re weather resistant  of course if it s designed in the pacific northwest, you would expect that, which comes in handy  that s my first cool tool  plenty of pockets, but there are lapels so you can get away with murder  you could wear it in a light rain, or you could wear it at a nice dinner  it s an incredibly flexible piece of clothing ''kevin kelly  one of the hazards for me, anyway, is if i try to roll up a jacket, i never quite get the wrinkles out  no iron shirts, you can kind of hang in your hot shower and wrinkles will dissipate  how does this work in terms of unwrinkling it, or does it just magically unwrinkled?''tim ferriss  this particular jacket has a number of features that disguise wrinkles  there s also just the material science aspect  the fabric blends that are used tend not to wrinkle, number one  two, it has folds and pockets and lapels that for whatever reason make wrinkles less noticeable  and then there s the color  if you want to avoid problems with wrinkles generally, at least in my experience, you want darker clothing so that under light, you re not having shadows cast across or beneath the wrinkles  so this is a charcoal colored jacket ''kevin kelly  it s kind of like your typical suit jacket length, or is it more like an outdoor jacket at the waist?''tim ferriss  i would say typical dinner jacket length  it doesn t show off any midriff  for those of you who are looking for that, you re out of luck ''kevin kelly  or your belt  you d be able to see your belt if it were unbuttoned in the front ''kevin kelly  it s very lightweight  tell the readers how small it compresses  if you were to roll it up well, and if you want to know how to roll up a jacket like that well, you could actually go online and look at how a judo uniform is folded  if you roll it up well, you are looking at let s just say the bottom three quarters, meaning it will cover the very bottom fabric of a standard sized school backpack ''so we re not talking about a hiker s backpack  if i had to estimate, i d say i get it down to about a roll that is ten inches in length and about three to four inches in diameter ''kevin kelly  that s very impressive  i carry a lightweight down jacket that compresses into something very small but it s certainly not as fancy or suitable for a dinner jacket like yours is  a couple other tips for folks, and i am by no means a hyper minimalist, appalachian trail hiker or anything like that, but i also have, for instance, because i don t want to lose the insulating ability if it gets wet, i have a synthetic down vest that is also stuffed into this backpack which i can put on top of that fancy looking jacket in case i need more warmth ''kevin kelly  that s brilliant  that s a brilliant hack  again, that s called the nau jacket?''tim ferriss  n a u, nau ''kevin kelly  approximately what does it cost? just give me a range  that s a really good question  i bought it a long time ago  it s not cheap, but then again if you re comparing it to any type of dinner jacket or outdoor jacket, it s not horribly expensive  i d say it s in the  150 to  350 range if i had to guess ''kevin kelly  okay, good  that s fantastic  what else do you have in your backpack, which is stuffed here in the back of our car right now?''tim ferriss  in my bag of tricks i have a logitech bluetooth keyboard ''and to put this in perspective, it s slightly larger than a paperback book, like a 5 by 8 inch trim paperback book  it is narrow enough that i will very often stick it into a journal to protect it, meaning it s probably the width of eight to ten paperback pages  it holds a charge very, very well  i use this often  if i have any issues with my laptop, i can pair it with my iphone which is a large sized iphone, and lean it against, say, a glass of ice tea and i can get any type of writing done that i need to get done ''also, if i feel like taking a day trip but not taking this backpack, which is one of my main pieces of luggage and stuffed full of stuff and kind of heavy, i can take the keyboard and my iphone and head off to some coffee shop ten or 15 minutes away without carrying all of my gear with me ''kevin kelly  i m going to try to describe this a little bit further  it s very, very thin and very lightweight  it feels like it s made out of aluminum and has kind of a matte texture finish on it  it feels very velvety  it s mostly a charcoal color with white letters  this would serve as a keyboard with a phone, and the keyboard itself is pretty large in terms of your finger spacing so there would be no cramping  that is really cool  yeah, it s a great device  i have had this now for i would say two years and i ve never had a technical fail  so as a form of backup, i find it to be very cheap insurance  because as you can see in person, this is lightweight and i m not going to get scoliosis as having this additional piece of gear  i just stick it into a large format journal or even a magazine and i can travel with it  ''kevin kelly  that s really cool  so it pairs up through bluetooth, i would imagine, right?''tim ferriss  that s right ''kevin kelly  so you can pair it up to an ipad if you wanted to, as well as a phone if you happen to carry one?''tim ferriss  definitely ''kevin kelly  what s that called again?''tim ferriss  this is a logitech bluetooth keyboard  we ll put the exact model in the show notes for everybody  next up, these all travel together  i very rarely take these out of my backpack  this is max silicone ear plugs, which unlike foam earplugs are not inserted into the ear canal and then left to expand  these are effectively smeared over the ear opening  you have, in all caps  do not insert  just cover ear opening  these i found through swimmers, in fact  they are very waxy and almost look like candies  some type of caramel but they re white colored ''i find them to block sound much more effectively than any type of phone earplug, although there are some good ones on the market to be sure ''kevin kelly  do you use them just once, or can they be reused or recycled, or they last a little bit and get grungy? what s their use?''tim ferriss  i definitely reuse these  if i had to guesstimate, i would say four to five nights and then they start to lose their adherence because they get less tacky over time  the most important that i don t want to overlook is that as someone who tends to rotate from back to slide, so sleeping on my back and my side, foam earplugs will very often hurt  they ll get pushed into your ear when you roll onto your side  that is not the case with these ''kevin kelly  so for side sleepers, these are a real cool tool because that allows you to sleep on your side while you have these earplugs in  definitely  and even as someone who kind of tosses and turns, in my case i don t tend to wake up on my side but i am constantly going onto my side, and foam earplugs often will wake me up ''kevin kelly  cool  is this mostly just used for sleeping, or do you use these for other sorts of sound abatement?''tim ferriss  these earplugs live in each of my bags that i tend to travel with  so i have redundant caches of earplugs  one in this bag, one in my other bag, and sometimes i ll even have them in jackets ''kevin kelly  but mostly for sleeping?''tim ferriss  mostly for sleeping, definitely ''kevin kelly  or if you re sitting on an airplane and trying to read and just want to drown out the sound,  inaudible   '' crosstalk  then you can use them, for sure  or if you re swimming and you want to avoid swimmer s ear ''kevin kelly  okay, what s your fourth cool tool?''tim ferriss  i might go over slightly here, but my fourth cool tool is a neck pillow ''kevin kelly  i want one of those  i ve tried many different neck pillows  most of them are very uninspiring and even less effective for helping me sleep  this, and i ll do my best here, cabeau, i believe is the pronunciation  c a b e a u and it has  evolution pillow  written on the side  you can see that it compresses down very nicely ''kevin kelly  it s like the side of a grapefruit or cantaloupe?''tim ferriss  yeah, like a small cantaloupe or a large grapefruit and you could certainly compress it more  the actual bag that it comes with allows you to wrap it up and then compress it down to a smaller size  it s just a very nice, in essence memory foam, neck pillow that also clips in the front ''what i ve found is not only does it help me sleep if i m sitting upright, but it also is very, very helpful for getting to sleep when i m laying prone, whether it s on an airplane or even in a hotel room if the pillows are of dubious quality ''kevin kelly  do you have to inflate this by pumping or blowing air into it? or is it self expanding?''tim ferriss  it s self expanding  you can think of it almost as a sponge like material that you can press down, and then when you release it, it inflates or rather i should say expands automatically ''kevin kelly  is it one of those horseshoe shaped items, or is it just a little kind of wedge that sits behind your neck?''tim ferriss  it is horseshoe shaped  if you imagine a horseshoe being hung around the back of your neck, that is the shape  it can clip in the front and the design is such that there is a ridge that supports basically the occipital area at the base of the skull ''kevin kelly  it s very ergonomic in that sense  it is  it s the most comfortable neck pillow that i have found ''kevin kelly  it s a little bulky but it s pretty light  it s light, and as far as neck pillows go, not very bulky at all  if you re going to have a neck pillow, generally speaking in my experience at least, it s going to be inflatable and quite uncomfortable or you re going to end up with this type of compromise, and this is the best i ve found ''kevin kelly  it could pretty easily disappear into a day pack  i think it absolutely could  and certainly if you wanted, you could lash this to the outside of a pack  i happen to have enough space in my bag so i include it, but you could lash it or hang it on the outside ''kevin kelly  sometimes you have the privilege of flying first class and you can lie down, but other times if you re stuck in economy you really need one of these things to sleep in a seat  i do, at least  the last thing i ll mention, and then i want to ask you about an app that you have which is very, very different  another app that i use a lot when i m traveling, and i use it as home as well, is called  apnea trainer   i don t use it for its intended use  i have an off label use  apnea trainer is used by people who are training for free diving and what to improve their breath hold times  there are different types of tempos that you can use for different types of training ''there s pranayama breathing, there is the apnea breathing which would be a ratio of inhale, hold, exhale  or inhale, hold, exhale, hold  so you might have something like five seconds in, 20 second hold  ten second exhale  so it s a one four two ratio ''and what i ve found is if i only have five to ten minutes and i don t have time for my usual morning meditation i like to do, which is generally something like transcendental mediation of 20 minutes, that five minutes of breathing training with a voice that will count down for you is very much grounding for the rest of the day ''kevin kelly  so it s kind of like a substitute to meditation because you focus on your breath but you re focused on holding your breath, not just breathing regularly  that s right  i would say it is meditation but it s a guided, breathing meditation that has the side effect of performance enhancement, if that s what you re going for  and obviously, i m not a doctor and i don t play one on the internet so people who are listening, especially you crazy, haphazard males, do not use this right before you go into the water and don t try to break any personal records holding your breath without very, very qualified supervision because you can die with shallow water blackouts and other issues  i use this just as a kickstart to my day ''kevin kelly  you re sitting in maybe a position or something, and the worst that could happen is you d fall over  that s right  i m just sitting on a hotel bed or a hotel couch, generally ''kevin kelly  that s super  and that s called what?''tim ferriss  apnea trainer  what is the app that you have on your phone that you were showing me earlier today?''kevin kelly  i have a little, tiny app on my iphone, and i it s on android as well  it s called  my tracks   what it does is it makes a gps log of our travel, wherever we re going  the important thing is it does it without having to have cellular service somewhere  because in these foreign countries, i don t normally turn my cell phone service off but it s still getting gps signals  and just that information is enough to create a gps log of a journey  the advantage of that is one  you have a record of your journey that you can import into google earth just with a kml format ''but more importantly, if you have a camera that has a clock in it, a they all do these days, you can synchronize your clock to the local time and you ll have a way to time stamp and view tag your photographs  so the software will look at the time stamp for a particular photograph and then it will s how you the exact coordinates of where that photograph was taken  so i don t have to remember where was i when i took that photograph  i can just import that into light room or something and it s going to show me the geographical locations for every one of my photographs  i found this fascinating and it also begged the question for me  let s just say you re going on an excursion through the grand canyon or going on an extended trip overseas ''is there a potential safety element where that data could be then pinged back to some type of service that can monitor your last known whereabouts if you go mia? which if you are a developer of this app or know the developer, i d love to know the answer or if there s something similar that s available  i thought that was a very, very cool app ''kevin kelly  that would be really cool if you could live stream your location to permitted, interested parties  i would just have to imagine that there would be an app that did that somewhere  you d think there must be one available somewhere  one other cool tool that you have, which is more common here than i would have expected but in retrospect i shouldn t be surprised  it is very, very hot here  it can get very, very hot and the sun is extremely powerful to the extent that we visited a solar furnace not long ago that could be used to melt various objects at absurdly high temperatures ''kevin kelly  yes  3,000 degrees centigrade  exactly  our esteemed guide has an umbrella   smart move   to create shade wherever he wants it  you have an umbrella, but you made a modification to your umbrella ''kevin kelly  i just had an ordinary cheap, chinese, black, really compact umbrella that i carry in my little camera bag all the time  i spray painted the top of it silver so that it reflects the light and it makes it a little bit cooler on the inside  because just with the black umbrella, it tends to absorb that infrared and reradiate it back down on your head  having a silver reflective layer bounces at least 60 percent of that back into the sky and it s a lot cooler  there are versions of the silver umbrella  they re extremely lightweight ''they re not as collapsible as the one i have but they re made for hiking  i think it s called the  silver dome,  if i m not mistaken  they weigh only a few ounces  people out west, even if you re climbing at the high altitudes, a lot of the long distance hikers now carry an umbrella for portable shade  they walk along under the shade  shade follows them  it really makes a huge difference when you re backpacking because you can really work up a sweat  and the hat doesn t allow your head to cool off but the umbrella does  yes, i ve had umbrella envy since i landed on this trip  kevin, i ve had so much fun  i ve wanted to travel overseas with you for ages, and here we are  so i m really glad that it came together ''kevin kelly  yes, and tim, thanks for your great cool tool reviews  where can people who have never heard of tim ferriss find out what you re up to? and by the way, what are you up to next?''tim ferriss  up to next, well, i have a new ted talk that should be coming out shortly  very personal and it talks about fighting off the dark moments and overcoming self doubt and so on  it s a very personal journey through how to overcome some of those darker and even dangerous moments ''kevin kelly  just search tim ferriss at tedx or ted?''tim ferriss  if people search tim ferriss, ted talk they will be able to find at least one and potentially two including the new one  i ll be giving away several hundred pages of my favorite stoic writing, along with modern essays that i ve added in and new artwork and original commissioned illustrations and calligraphy  all sorts of fun stuff  i ll be giving all of that away for free in three volumes called  the tao of seneca   so people can just search  tao seneca free book   they should be able to also find it on amazon and that should be available i would say in early to mid june ''kevin kelly  and that s going to be orderable on amazon and on your website?''tim ferriss  it should be available on amazon, should be available via pdf  i m just going to unleash it in the wild  they can certainly go to tim blog to find everything related to the projects as well as those ebooks and pdfs and everything else ''kevin kelly  tim log?''tim ferriss  tim blog ''kevin kelly  oh, blog  okay, tim blog  yeah, tim blog  it s a lot easier to spell than the previous urls  kevin, for people who don t know how to find you and want to learn more, where can they find you?''kevin kelly  i m kk org, o r g  did you say k k dot pork? just kidding ''kevin kelly  it s the air pressure  our ears are not working up at this ascent  anything that you re working on that you d like people to check out?''kevin kelly  i have the paperback version of my book, the inevitable, which is being launched in june  so it s preorder for  12 00  it s cheaper than printing it out yourself so go there at amazon and in june i ll be talking a little bit more about the updated version, which is not updated so i haven t changed my mind about anything in the last 12 months about the coming 20 years  so i stand by everything i said  now it s in paperback  thank you, kevin ''kevin kelly  and thank you, tim  we have many adventures ahead ''kevin kelly  you have another cool tool to talk about  in fact it s just about in my mouth  it s up against my face  tell me, what is this thing?''tim ferriss  i get that response a lot  this is the yellow tech ixm microphone  i travel with this almost always  what would you compare this to?''i would say if you took six d batteries and laid them end to end, perhaps ''kevin kelly  it s like an old fashioned flashlight  yeah, an old fashioned flashlight  this is a microphone that can capture just tremendous quality of audio  it automatically equalizes  it has playback buttons on the side  it all records to an sd card that s inserted in the bottom and it s battery powered so you can take it on the road  everything is contained and housed in this one unit that then goes into a tiny zip up bag  so this just lives really inside my backpack  so if i don t have a chance to bring more gear, or don t want to bring more gear, i can use this at any time, anywhere and shazim ''kevin kelly  so you might record an introduction of one of your podcasts from the back of a car going over the mountain pass in uzbekistan, right? you d be able to just pull it out and record and it would have as good quality as any real digital studio might?''tim ferriss  it very often does  i ve recorded podcast intros in airplane bathrooms before  certainly not ideal but you can really get away with murder with this device  it makes up for a lot of environmental factors that could otherwise really screw things up  also, if you re on the move and you happen to bump into someone who is fascinating and in my case i say would you mind if i ask you just a few questions, and they re up for it  you can really on the drop of a dime capture these moments that would otherwise be lost ''kevin kelly  just to emphasize, this is a microphone that has a built in recording device into the handle of it so it s all in one  it s more than a microphone  it s a digital recording device built into a microphone  that s right  and then when i m done recording, i would pop out this sd card, i would slap it into a laptop when i have access to one an drop the file then into a dropbox folder, which would sync at the first opportunity to connect to wifi and then that is available to my team  so i could send a link to that dropbox through slack to my team and off to the races  they have the interview files, they have the intra files, whatever it might be, and then it can all be polished for publication ''kevin kelly  so in some kind of ways, except for the ambient sound, it s a portable recording studio  it absolutely is a portable recording studio, and i think that some of my best audio that has appeared on the podcast has come from this mike  people find it hard to believe because they ll ask which studio i use in san francisco, and i ll say my bedroom and a handheld mike  that s my studio ''kevin kelly  that s a really cool tool  tim, can you give me a range of the price just so we ll have some idea? we ll have show notes about the particular model, but just give a little bit of a range  if i had to guess, and it s been a long time since i looked at the pricing but i would say it s somewhere between  400 and  700  it s not cheap  but when i consider the alternatives, let s just say the h6 zoom which is the general recorder that i use with the xlr cables and the stage mikes and everything else involved, you re getting into a similar price range or above  this just offers a lot more convenience in terms of its form factor ''kevin kelly  i have to tell you, tim travels light  he s not an ultra light traveler but a very lightweight traveler with very minimal bags  this is one of the things you packed, so it s very impressive that it s light enough and small enough that even when you re not packing much else, you can fit this in even if you re a very weight conscious traveler  definitely  there are other alternatives ''i had enough space also to pack a road ixy microphone which is intended to be connected via lightning port to, say, an iphone  so i am testing different alternatives to compare sound quality, but thus far the yellow tech ixm has not let me down so i will continue using it until i find a superior solution ''kevin kelly  definitely a cool tool  thanks '"
113,117,117: Dominic D’Agostino ,"   quick sound check  what did you have for breakfast this morning?  dominic d agostino   eggs and sardines and oysters    tim ferriss   eggs and sardines and oysters? did you just throw that in the    dominic d agostino     and broccoli, a little bit of broccoli   tim ferriss     you just throw it in a vitamix? hello, boys and girls  this is tim ferriss, and welcome to another episode of the tim ferriss show where it is my job to deconstruct world class performers  that means that i interview people ranging from chess prodigies like josh waitzkin to celebrities and governators like arnold schwarzenegger to everything in between, whether those are athletes, scientists, military strategists, or otherwise  and this episode is a very fun one  it gets into the weeds  if you ve loved the episodes with dr  peter attia or pavel tsatsouline or others, you will most likely love this one  my guest is dr  dominic d agostino, better known as dom  most people refer to him as dom  he is an assistant professor in the department of molecular pharmacology and physiology at the university of south florida morsani college of medicine and a senior research scientist at the institute for human and machine cognition  and when i have questions about ketosis, about fasting, or about the deadlift, i call dom  why? well, among other things, for instance, he has fasted for seven days and then deadlifted 500 pounds for ten reps  he is a beast, both physically and intellectually  he has published or coauthored many different fascinating papers, research papers  and no big surprise  he s a good buddy of dr  peter attia, who i mentioned shortly ago  now, pete of course drinks so called  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    jet fuel in search of optimal athletic performance, sometimes ends up dry heaving in the kitchen trying not to wake his family, and i enjoy these types of human guinea pigs of course  the focus of dom s laboratory primarily is developing and testing metabolic therapies, including ketogenic diets, ketone esters and ketone supplements to induce nutritional and therapeutic ketosis  there is a lot more to it  some of his research has been funded by the office of naval research, department of defense, etc  he s a fascinating guy  if you are remote interested in, say, cancer prevention or longevity or maximal performance, then this episode will touch on many, many cutting edge aspects, theories, and practical implementations of research that is at the forefront right now  so please enjoy my conversation with dom d agostino  dom, welcome to the show  dominic d agostino   thanks for having me, tim, appreciate it   tim ferriss   of course  i have my notebook out always when i m on the phone with you, walking around, i m struggling to find paper in my pockets or record notes  so i have all of my materials ready  i ve spoken with our dear friend pete attia to sort of plot the arc of questions that i would ask you, mostly out of pure self interest  but for those people who are unfamiliar with you, when someone asks you, what do you do, how do you answer that question?  dominic d agostino   well, it depends on who it is, but i tell them   i try to be brief as possible  i just say i m a scientist, and i study nutritional neuroscience, i think, is kind of how i like to phrase it as concisely as possible   tim ferriss   and if you re talking to a fellow scientist, how would that answer change, if at all?  dominic d agostino   i kind of go into kind of describing how i study integrative metabolic regulation and how what we eat or certain  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    supplements can change our metabolic physiology to treat, prevent disease, or enhance performance  tim ferriss   very cool   dominic d agostino   that kind of sums up, yeah   tim ferriss   and speaking of performance, and this is a question i ask all of my guests, but what is the most you ve ever deadlifted after fasting for seven days?  dominic d agostino   wow, i imagine you get a range of responses from that question  oh, okay, so you ve talked to peter attia  he s filled you in on that  so i guess going back when i really got interested in fasting, i did a seven day fast, and it just happened to conclude right before i had to give a lecture kind of on the topic  and i went into it with my glucose in the mid maybe 30s, low 40s and my ketones up there at about 5 millimolars or so  and then i did go to the gym  yeah, i deadlifted 500 for ten, and i finished off with a one rep of 585, six plates  i haven t done that since  i haven t done anything that extreme since  but i just felt like   i was inspired by george cahill  he was a researcher at harvard medical school  and he did a fascinating study that really   where he fasted people for 40 days actually  and i ve delved into the literature studying that  well, and i thought, well, i can do seven days if these study subjects were irb approved  inaudible   so, yeah, i did that, and i found the first three days were a little tough, and then i just started cruising along  but at day 5 and 7, i was feeling   my energy level was taking a dip for sure, but i was amazingly resilient  and i felt that had a lot to do with being in a state of fasting ketosis  and i was firmly convinced that   and this is when i just started kind of studying this field  so i was doing a lot of bloodwork on myself, too, to figure out what was happening   tim ferriss   and what was the time   what was the year roughly? when was this?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    dominic d agostino   this was 2010    tim ferriss   got it   dominic d agostino     i think, going into, yeah, 2009 into 2010  so i d been into this area of research for about a year or so  in 2009, i d really started getting research funding to do what i m doing now   tim ferriss   it s funny to me that these subjects were able to be fasted for 40 days and everything got approved, but if you wanted to fast animals in certain circumstances, it seems like you can t go beyond one to three days   dominic d agostino   oh, yeah, yeah, that s good  you know, i serve on the university institute for animal care and use committee  it s called iacuc  it s like the animal irb  and, yeah, the committee usually has a reactionary response to anything under 25 percent calorie restriction   inaudible  more than 20, 25 percent of their weight for a fat rodent, really that s not much  you can t do that anymore  you ve got to refeed them  so, yeah, i am amazed that some of the stuff got approved  i think the irb was probably on vacation or something back then  yeah, irbs are a little different now   tim ferriss   can you explain what irb is or define that for people who aren t familiar with that?  dominic d agostino   yeah, it s the institutional review board that will review kind of the ethics and the safety of a study before signing off on it essentially and allowing   it s a committee of people that have kind of a broad range of expertise, and they review the reason why the study is going to be done, the methodology, the ethics, the purpose and all that stuff and approve whether or not the study can be conducted  and it really depends on what institute you re at  you can use an outside irb that s outside of the institution, and companies do that  industry does that  but they can be a big hurdle, and i ve found vastly different irbs  there s a small college, about ten, 15 minutes from here that ran a ketogenic diet study in advanced lifters for us  and the irb was approved in, like, two weeks  at university of south florida    copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   which is fast   dominic d agostino   very fast, yeah, like, two or three weeks  and other irbs, i think i did one, a pharmacokinetic study for ketone esters, which i ll probably talk more about later, but that one i think has been rejected somewhere about seven or eight times  and, i mean, it s just giving as a single dose kind of more or less a bioidentical molecule that our body makes  and the committee is just, because it s, quote, unquote, first in human, it s very difficult  and this is an outside irb, which is less restrictive in many cases  so they can be a big hurdle to an investigator   tim ferriss   yeah, especially if the 25 percent or more loss is deemed cruel and unusual punishment   dominic d agostino   oh, okay, for the animal study, yes  yeah, in these human studies, there s pretty stringent criteria on the humans and stuff  but, yeah, the animal studies would be bad   tim ferriss   what was the study that you did on advanced lifters as it related to ketosis, and what s kind of the abstract on that?  dominic d agostino   yeah, that s under review right now   tim ferriss   got it   dominic d agostino   and, yeah, i ll give you kind of like the synopsis of it  so we had 12 subjects, and these were advanced resistance trained individuals, meaning that they could squat and deadlift and bench a certain percentage of their bodyweight, which kind of puts them in the range of the top 10 percent of lifters out there   tim ferriss   what was that percentage, just out of curiosity?  dominic d agostino   i ve got to go back  it was some funky number  it was like 185 percent or 75 percent    tim ferriss   got it   dominic d agostino     of their bodyweight squatting for seven reps or eight reps or something like that   tim ferriss   got it   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    dominic d agostino   so it was pretty   it would be like me   let me see   squatting 425 or something for a set of six or something like that   tim ferriss   okay, yeah, these are very    dominic d agostino   it was pretty significant   tim ferriss     yeah, significantly advanced trainees   dominic d agostino   yeah  so, yeah, the gist of that is that we did a parallel  the control group was on a western diet, which is pretty similar to kind of moderate protein, higher in carbohydrates and moderate fat  and the ketogenic diet had roughly 75 to 80 percent fat, restricted carbohydrates to about 20 to 25 grams per day, and the fat was also supplemented to some extent with mct oil and coconut oil  and all the subjects   it was two weeks they had to be on the diet and had to confirm ketone levels by blood and urine  and once they did, we only did a two week adaptation, which is kind of another subject we could talk about, but they adapted for two weeks and then kind of trained the heck out of them  and every workout was done in the lab in a human performance laboratory  and everything was recorded  the volume was controlled  all the parameters were controlled  bloodwork was done  and the take home on it was that strength, you know, i would say strength and performance were maintained and increased, and muscle hypertrophy was seen with a ketogenic diet  and there were similar increases, yeah, in power, in hypertrophy  and the big difference was kind of the overall body composition was more favorable in the ketogenic diet group, meaning they had similar increases in lean body mass, but they lost proportionately more fat  and that s the study we completed  it s under review right now  the first journal kicked it back, so we went in for another journal and did some follow up work with it   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   now, what is your hypothesis   or maybe you already know   but how would you explain the maintenance or even development of hypertrophy and power in the ketogenic group when a lot of people associate, say, insulin with different growth factors and whatnot? and i had a conversation   i want to say it was with steven phinney   very short conversation, and i asked him this because i d been in a ketotic state for two or three weeks and had experienced a non trivial amount of muscle growth, and i was really surprised by it  and he explained in terms that i can t recall but how the ketogenic diet might have a, i guess, like a branched chain amino acid sparing effect of some type  but is it possible to get very big and powerful on a ketogenic diet? and if so, what s the mechanism in the sort of absence of higher spiking insulin levels if that is the parent anabolic hormone, and i m not saying it is, but a lot of people view it that way?  dominic d agostino   yeah, so there s insulin and insulin signaling, right? certain diet   like, when you calorie restrict a rodent or even humans or any mammal, you will enhance insulin sensitivity, right? so you will be more sensitive to a given amount of insulin  and i think we re seeing some of that in the athletes  i mean, exercise itself enhances insulin sensitivity  so, and guys that are advanced lifters who ve been at it for, like, ten years may have a different response to a ketogenic diet than, say, a 15 year old kid who s trying to bulk up for football  he would probably not be a good candidate for the ketogenic diet  your sensitivity to things like igf 1 and insulin are much higher when you re younger, in your teenage years especially  so you could compromise a lot of your potential development and strength if you re younger and doing that  but the older we get, the less carbohydrate tolerant we get, so we lose our ability to kind of process carbs as we get older and our insulin sensitivity declines   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    now, going back to your question, as it relates to being on a ketogenic diet, we know that ketones are anti catabolic  that s why we can fast for 40 days  and the ketones have an anticatabolic protein sparing effect  and if our blood is flooded with ketones, we re less likely to liberate gluconeogenic amino acids from our skeletal muscle for fuel because the ketones can more or less replace glucose as the primary energy substrate to maintain your central nervous system, which is, like, three percent of our body by weight but sucks up 20 or 25 percent of the energy  it s a big metabolic engine  so the ketones kind of drive a lot of that substrate energy need  so, in a situation where you re at a caloric deficit, i think that s where ketones can shine if you re trying to make weight, if you re trying to preserve or even increase your performance and strength and alter your body composition  so i don t think the ketogenic diet is ideal if your goal is maximum   a purely ketogenic diet  i think there are different   we have to kind of figure out what ketogenic diet we re talking about, but i don t think a purely ketogenic diet as it s kind of described in the literature, right, a 90 or 85 percent fat diet is an ideal diet for growth and repair  the diet that we use in our study is actually a little higher in protein, like 25 percent protein, which is really almost double that used by the johns hopkins group that developed the classical ketogenic diet  and it s really that that protein level is important  so growing on a classic ketogenic diet would be pretty hard  i mean, kids do it  their growth rates are a little bit less with these kids that have drug resistant seizures when they re put on the diet  but if you simply just do what s called a modified atkins, and there s a lot of literature coming out now on the modified atkins   eric kossoff at johns hopkins, he s a colleague of mine and more in the clinical realm, and he s done a lot of work showing that a modified atkins, which is about 70 percent fat and 20 or 30 percent protein, has the same sort of ability to metabolically manage seizures   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and i think that sort of diet can be used pretty successfully in the performance world and specifically for body builders  i think with that amount of protein, you would be able to grow muscle for sure  and it s calories too, right? i mean, calories are the driver, your caloric intake  if you have a surplus amount of calories, you re more likely to push insulin up and drive anabolic processes  but a lot of times, people when they follow a ketogenic diet, because ketones have a really good appetite suppressant effect, that they will inadvertently restrict calories and may not even know it after a while and may be losing weight without even trying, and that s one of the benefits, i guess you could say, of the ketogenic diet  you can lose weight and you can alter your body composition without necessarily even trying, just through the appetite suppressing effect  tim ferriss   and let s define a few terms for folks who may be outsiders to this world  you know, you re talking about ketosis  let s define ketosis  what is ketosis? and i guess we could talk about nutritional end sort of fasting ketosis  but what is ketosis exactly? and what are ketones?  dominic d agostino   okay  i d kind of like to start out with fasting, right?  tim ferriss   sure, perfect   dominic d agostino   so we re on a normal diet, and we stop eating all of a sudden  we will mobilize and use up our stored glycogen, mostly in the liver, right? and our central nervous system more or less demands that we have a steady fuel supply to our brain  and in the absence of glucose availability, we ll be depleting our liver glycogen  the insulin levels will be suppressed, and we ll start mobilizing fatty acids for fuel  but fatty acids, long chain fatty acids don t cross the bloodbrain barrier very efficiently  so the liver, while you re suppressing the hormone insulin, you ll upregulate beta oxidation of fatty acids in the liver  and an accumulation of products from fatty acid oxidation will start forming ketone bodies  and these ketone bodies are    copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    they re more or less like water soluble fat molecules, and they re small molecules that can readily cross the blood brain barrier and get inside cells, into the mitochondria  and as we fast, within about 24 to 48 hours, we ll start registering ketones to the level that clinically is defined as being in ketosis   tim ferriss   i was going to ask you about that   dominic d agostino     which is above 0 5 millimolar   tim ferriss   oh, above 0 5   dominic d agostino   typically, yeah  so a person a high carb diet would probably take about 24 to 48 hours to start even getting into mild ketosis  but fasting is the fastest way to get into ketosis  and that s why if you have a child with drug resistant seizures, and they re administered or they re admitted into a place like johns hopkins, the old protocol was to fast them  they re not exactly sure if that s absolutely necessary with things like more   with ketogenic diets, have mcts and stuff  but you can   fasting has classically been the fastest way to get into ketosis  so the ketogenic diet has a macronutrient ratio that s high in fat, typically 90 to 70    tim ferriss   and by macronutrients, we re referring to protein, fat, carbohydrates   dominic d agostino   yeah, yeah  and maybe ketones could be the fourth macronutrient maybe if you talk about exogenous ketones  but a ketogenic diet has a macronutrient ratio that mimics the metabolic physiology that you have when you re fasting  so, if you were to take the blood out of someone, do a blood sample of someone on a strict ketogenic diet, it would look like they re fasting, like they ve been fasting a few days  and that allows you to get some   that changes your physiology incredibly  your metabolic physiology changes acutely, and then there s long term changes that occur with that, epigenetic changes  we know that beta hydroxybutyrate,  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    which is a ketone body, can have interesting effects on gene expression  tim ferriss   what types of effects?  dominic d agostino   well, there was a science paper showing that betahydroxybutyrate is an hdac class i and class ii inhibitor and can activate genes that play a role in enhancing exogenous antioxidant mechanisms, specifically superoxide dismutase and catalase  so these mechanisms, when they re upregulated, it confers protection against the environment  it sort of enhances our cellular defense mechanisms  it enhances the robust kind of protective mechanisms that the cell has that can preserve the genome stability  so maybe being in a state of ketosis and maintaining that can protect your dna from damage, so that s the implications  also, anti inflammatory   so we published a paper   our colleagues actually did at yale  i developed the diet for them and sent it up to them  it was exogenous ketone  but the paper demonstrated that it activated or prevented the activation of a particular inflammasome that s linked to age related chronic diseases  so it inhibited a specific inflammatory pathway that is really associated with all chronic age related diseases  and it was independent of the ketones  effect on metabolism  so they teased out   they did a lot of studies to tease out the mechanism and demonstrated that the effect of it suppressing this inflammatory pathway was completely independent of its metabolic effect  so we understand that   you know, when i got into this, i just knew that ketones were an energy metabolite  so now we know it s much more than a metabolite  it s an hdac inhibitor  and the pharmaceutical    tim ferriss   how do you spell that? i apologize, the hdac?  dominic d agostino   yeah, histone deacetylase inhibitor, so hdac would be h da c   tim ferriss   got it   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    dominic d agostino   and then there s class i, ii, iii, i think iv  so class i and ii hdac inhibitors are a big, big   are of big interest to the pharmaceutical industry  so there are many   for example, we do a lot of cancer research  there s a lot of pharmaceutical companies focusing on histone deacetylase inhibitors as targeting specific pathways for cancer therapy  so you have an endogenous hdac inhibitor with betahydroxybutyrate    tim ferriss   and just   not to interrupt, but just for people who want to keep endogenous and exogenous straight, i ve always found thinking of exoskeleton as sort of outside, as an indicator of outside  so if you re taking   please correct me if i screw this up in any way, dom   but if you re taking exogenous ketones, that means you are consuming ketones from outside of your body  and endogenous is something you re producing yourself   dominic d agostino   yes, right   tim ferriss   so, in a case for instance with cancer, i have a friend who recently went through chemotherapy, and he would fast for three days prior to his chemotherapy  and in the same group, almost everyone was   aside from him, everyone else was laid out for days after chemotherapy, really unable to function, and he was able to go for ten mile runs, for instance  and i ve been very fascinated by looking at the implications of combining fasting with, for instance, chemotherapy and the treatment of cancer  if you were, say, advising someone with a family history of alzheimer s and parkinson s, which i have, so i don't know if those fall into the age related issues that you were talking about, but are there implications for fasting or nutritional ketosis or exogenous ketones for helping to prevent or mitigate the onset of those type of neurodegenerative diseases?  dominic d agostino   yeah, and fasting has to be done under   you have to know your body, right? and fasting should probably be done under a pretty strict medical supervision    copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   sure, agreed   dominic d agostino     to some extent, yeah   tim ferriss   agreed   dominic d agostino   so someone would have to do a little research on it  and it would depend on the particular person  so, if you have a cancer person that it s a woman with breast cancer, say, and she has a bmi of 28 and is going in for chemo, i think it s a good idea for them to fast before they go in  but if you have    tim ferriss   bmi, body mass index   dominic d agostino   oh, body mass index, yeah   tim ferriss   and that would make her obese? i actually don t know kind of the scale of bmi   dominic d agostino   yeah, that would make her kind of a little pudgy, i guess, and have some extra weight to lose  so we know that getting chemo in a fasted state, there s a couple reports out there showing that it sensitizes   it can sensitize the tumor to the therapeutic effects of the agents  and also there s some evidence showing that it could prevent some of the side effects associated with chemotherapeutic agents, specifically things that cause cell damage  so being in a state of fasting ketosis can sensitize the tumor to the damaging effects of the chemo and enhance your healthy cells  resistance against the toxic effects of the chemotherapeutic agent  and you d want to do it   i think the majority of patients could probably do it, but if you have someone with severe cancer cachexia, muscle wasting, you d want to do it in a very cautious way  but i definitely think this is something that should be implemented in our oncology wards, that fasting before chemo definitely has some real benefits that we should be utilizing   tim ferriss   no, it s so fascinating  so cachexia, man, you are a treasure trove of vocabulary  so is that acute muscle loss, as opposed to sarcopenia, which would be the   i m not up to speed on my  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    latin   which would be sort of the muscle loss attributed to aging, or what is cachexia? dominic d agostino   yeah, so cachexia would be defined as   yeah, actually, investigators are trying to get a clear definition of it and understanding of it, which our lab   i have one of my students who just studies cancer cachexia  cachexia s defined in cancer as you re in a physiological state where your body is releasing factors, like tumor necrosis factor alpha and inflammatory cytokines, inflammatory mediators that are catabolizing your muscle tissue, your lean body mass   tim ferriss   and i apologize, i just want, for people who are unfamiliar with the vocab, so anabolism would be building tissue in general, and catabolism would be breaking down tissue? is that fair, or is it    dominic d agostino   exactly  like, anabolic steroids are building, and catabolic processes are the breaking down of things   tim ferriss   great  sorry to interrupt   dominic d agostino   oh, no, it s great  so, yeah, you re in a state where you re basically wasting lean body mass  you re wasting tissue  and a lot of cancer patients succumb to cancer cachexia, and its mortality is closely, intimately related to that  so, as you lose lean body mass from being in a state, say, for example, if someone has advanced metastatic cancer, that their survival will be tightly correlated with that, the ability to preserve their lean body mass and maintain their function  and in a lot of situations, you get this situation where you have an older patient that gets cancer, like 70 year old, and you have age related sarcopenia, right, they re already losing muscle, compounded with cancer cachexia, which increases lean body mass loss due to the pathology, on top of chemo induced cachexia   tim ferriss   oh, wow   dominic d agostino   so chemotherapy is a pretty powerful destructive agent to lean body mass on top of inactivity, so being immobilized  so you have age related sarcopenia, cancer cachexia, chemo induced cachexia   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and this typically, you know, you have a patient that s bedridden, so they re not stimulating their muscle with activity, so you have four factors coming together that cause like a perfect storm for you to just kind of waste away  and patients can go down so fast when they re put in that situation  so i think   so we re developing protocols to nutritional ketosis  we re looking at branched chain amino acid formulas  and we want to do some work to define specifically what types of exercise can mitigate all these factors and maybe some drugs and stuff too, we re interested in testing  so, yeah, i think that s not really being studied much  there s not a whole lot of investigators out there studying this  and i ve been in touch with a lot of patients, and i realize that this is key  i think a lot of patients would be alive today if we had effective ways to mitigate   because once they lose their mobility, once they get weak enough where they just can t move around, i mean, their whole psychology just deteriorates  tim ferriss   i would imagine   dominic d agostino   yeah, so there s a lot of reasons that we should be looking into keeping patients as strong and preserving their muscle as much as possible   tim ferriss   are there any knowledgeable folks out there   i was going to say scientists or researchers, but we both know a lot of folks who don t operate in the more formal worlds   dominic d agostino   yeah   tim ferriss   are there people out there who believe that there s a role of anabolic agents, whether steroids or otherwise, in those types of circumstances with, say, cancer patients? and i d be really interested to hear your thoughts just because there are also a lot of people who are trying to, say, minimize igf 1 among other things for longevity purposes or even for anti cancer purposes  but how do you think about that, or how do other people think about that?  dominic d agostino   well, i think it s a little outside of mainstream cancer kind of world that i m linked in with, but i think it should be  and i  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    think we want to develop a pretty solid program here in our lab to look into this  when it comes to anabolic agents, i think, you know, you go to the literature, and it shows that anabolic steroids do not promote, within certain dosing levels, they do not promote the growth and the spread of cancer  i m pretty sure the literature says that there are specific androgen receptor modulators out there  they re called sarms  and there s a few sarms   tim ferriss   sarms?  dominic d agostino     yeah, sarms that are out there, they basically have   they re designed to have the anabolic tissue building potency of testosterone and other anabolic steroids without the androgenic or the hormone effects  and they are actually developed specifically for cancer cachexia   tim ferriss   oh, really?  dominic d agostino   so there s a few out there, yeah, there s actually a few out there  and i think, you know, we re kind of interested in studying them  we re looking at branched chain amino acids right now, which we think are pretty important too  but if you give   so testosterone, for example, and a lot of males take testosterone to build muscle in the gym for hormone replacement therapy   if you administer testosterone, and the studies have been done, up to a certain point, once you get to about 300 milligrams per week, say, you start to increase systemic igf 1 levels  and if you go up to about 600 milligrams a week, which would put you at a supraphysiological level about twice or three times that of a normal male at least, that causes the liver to increase igf 1 release  so your systemic igf 1 will go up  but a dosage of, say, 100 to 200 milligrams a week does not increase, to my knowledge, factors, hormones, growth factors that would cause cancer to grow and spread  and i think at that dosage, especially with a lot of male cancer patients, that would have a pretty remarkable protein sparing effect   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and we know that anabolic agents can be life saving drugs for hiv patients   tim ferriss   absolutely, yeah, for muscle wasting   dominic d agostino     for patients with wasting diseases, yeah  i mean, they can   just look at the literature, and if you talk to the physicians and the doctors that treat their patients that are familiar with these agents and know how to intelligently prescribe them and administer them, they will tell you that they save lives  and i think that application may be useful in cancer  but i think the sarms are kind of an interesting compound that s coming out, and i think there s definitely some potential for some drugs out there   tim ferriss   now, is the advantage of a sarm over, say, a high anabolic, low androgenic steroid like a nandrolone or an oxandrolone, for instance, which is very popular with hiv patients who are trying to increase their t cell count and avoid muscle wasting, is the primary advantage of the sarm that it doesn t have the stigma associated with it of anabolic steroids? is it primarily kind of a political advantage that it doesn t carry that baggage, or are there other metabolic reasons to use it, as opposed to just standard kind of anabolic agents that are lowandrogenic? and just so people understand, and please correct me if i m screwing this up, but just for people to understand the context, when people talk about anabolic steroids, they re usually talking about anabolic androgenic steroids, right, and insomuch as they have anabolic, i e , tissue building, muscle building effects and then they have androgenic effects, which can accelerate the development of secondary sex characteristics, whether that s like a square jaw, male characteristics, or a deeper voice and the development of the vocal chords, more hair, acne, etc , that kind of stuff  so, in the case of someone with, say, a wasting disease, particularly if they are female instead of male, they will want to minimize the androgenic effects because they don t want to become men or become cavemen, and maximize the musclebuilding effects in this particular case   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    is that a fair description? feel free to add or edit anything that i just said, but i d be curious to hear sort of the advantage of sarms over preexisting low androgenic anabolic therapies  dominic d agostino   yeah, okay  so sarms are designed with the intention in mind to minimize the androgenic component down to nothing  that s really the goal  and i think they re pretty close to doing that  the problem is, in the real world when you read about guys taking this for muscle building, they have very kind of minimal anabolic properties compared to their anabolic steroid counterparts or cousins  but the advantage is that if you have a guy with prostate cancer, or all males probably get prostate cancer in time, so you can   high testosterone could drive the growth of your prostate in prostate cancer  and anabolic steroids could obviously have major side effects for women  i mean, we see this in women s bodybuilding, right? we see the side effects are pretty real and pretty nonreversible  so a selective androgen receptor modulator can have the advantage of potentially giving the protein sparing anabolic properties of the agents without the side effects  so there s not   there s research going on, but i don t think it s moving as fast as what we had initially anticipated, as far as them being super potent anabolic agents that would make anabolic steroids obsolete   tim ferriss   got it   dominic d agostino   so they re not at that level yet, but there s quite a few pharmaceutical companies working on it, and agents are   there s studies going on right now  and i think that data will probably come out in the next couple years   tim ferriss   yeah, i want to chat with you separately about how to marshal resources to do a lot more studies because i just   it s so frustrating to see these attractive targets or hypotheses that just, for lack of funding, particularly with technology and sort of the ability to do distributed studies potentially   anyway, you and i will have to chat more about that   dominic d agostino   yeah   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   but coming back to the chemotherapy because i love looking at cancer in sort of extreme states because i think then you can form hypotheses and test in those circumstances and then adapt findings to test in normal populations, which would, you know, i suppose i would include myself in that, although normal s kind of pushing it  is it possible, or to what extent is it possible, to mimic the benefits of fasting pre chemotherapy with exogenous ketones?  dominic d agostino   yeah  so i think we can view exogenous ketones are an energy containing substance, right, so you could potentially take them as a source of energy  they re energy that your liver only produces under certain circumstances of what s considered kind of strange metabolic physiology, like a fasting state   tim ferriss   right, duress of some type   dominic d agostino   yeah, so the ability, and we re interested in doing this, the ability to elevate, to produce an artificial state of ketosis is possible with exogenous ketones  and it mimics many effects of therapeutic fasting, which would be an acute and sustained reduction in blood glucose  and we don t really know why there s a remarkable decrease in blood glucose that s a dose dependent decrease  but it seems to be related to the liver s output of glucose  so your liver is a master regulator of your blood glucose really  and so the drug metformin in type 2 diabetics will decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis, so the liver s ability to make glucose and put it into the bloodstream  we think that ketones are doing this also   tim ferriss   interesting   dominic d agostino   and i think maybe it s kind of telling the body, hey, you re in a fasted state, so why don t you conserve the glucose that you have? and also, a big dose of ketones could potentially cause a small release of insulin, and that s kind of how we regulate our endogenous ketone production is that if our ketone levels get too high, that ketone will cause a very tiny release of insulin  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    from the pancreas, and that will signal the liver to kind of turn down or turn off hepatic ketogenesis  and when we re in a state of ketosis, we lose ketones through our urine  we burn them up through peripheral tissues  and if they get really high, we stimulate a small amount of insulin release  tim ferriss   what is really high on a millimolar basis as measured by, like, a precision xtra device from abbott, which is what i have six feet from me, which i ve been using? how high do your ketone levels need to get before that insulin level gets kicked out   of course, it depends on the person   but roughly speaking?  dominic d agostino   yeah, i think it s pretty rare to see over 5 millimolar  in kids, with kids that have a disorder called glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome, i m in touch with their parents, and they routinely stay in the 3 to 5 millimolar range  but typically, that s rare  they have to be on a really strict ketogenic diet  but typically, yeah, getting above 5 is kind of abnormal  and sometimes, if i m measuring, sometimes i ll just hit a peak  it s kind of like your hormones  they re going to fluctuate throughout the day  so, if you measure and you hit 7, i wouldn t panic or anything because it s probably a little peak that you re getting  but, yeah, typically, most people    tim ferriss   yeah, or you re pete attia doing a cycling workout   dominic d agostino   yeah, yeah, there s that   you have post exercise ketosis where guys that are on a high carb diet after four, five, six hours of intense exercise, they re going to deplete their liver glycogen and ramp up fatty acid oxidation so high, they re naturally just going to be in ketosis  so their body is used to seeing ketones because of the exercise that they do  but generally, yeah, i mean, moderate to mild ketosis is kind of what i like to promote for health and longevity, and that s between 1 and 3 millimolar  if you re within that range, that s a range that you ll pretty much never get into if you re not on a ketogenic diet, not fasting  and i think staying in that range has some real world benefits, as far as health benefits, longevity benefits, performance, resilience  i think there s some real world benefits to staying in that range   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and you d be hard pressed to find any potential adverse effects that could be linked to having ketones in that range  but once you get into 5, 6 millimolar range, that produces a metabolic   a mild metabolic acidosis that needs to be compensated for through your kidneys  so it is putting a stress   it s a substrate load to your system, and your body s got to deal with that  so i think that needs to be taken into account  tim ferriss   how do you currently   well, actually, let me ask a couple of questions just because i m in the middle of doing some ketosis experiments myself with exogenous ketones, so i have two jugs of exogenous ketones in my fridge  then i have some powdered beta hydroxybutyrate, which is, i guess, the   well, most people read it as ketocana, the c a n a, which i guess is, what, calcium potassium? am i getting that right? screwing that up   dominic d agostino   calcium sodium   tim ferriss   jesus, ferriss, so bad  anyway, i try  i try hard  i m like avis  so i have the powdered beta hydroxybutyrate  if i use that when i m trying to induce ketosis, right   so, for instance, this past week, i ate a low carb but still glucose dependent diet up until friday night, and then i fasted from friday after dinner until sunday evening  and now i m squarely into ketosis  i m probably at 1 1, 1 2 millimolars, i would say, upon waking  can i accelerate the induction of my own ketone production through use of exogenous ketones, or am i just temporarily spiking my readings when i m ingesting these things, and really my body is going to get to its sort of steady state, 1 1, 1 2 in the same amount of time regardless? does that question make sense?  dominic d agostino   yeah  i think there are significant advantages to speeding up the process, as far as how you feel  and i think that if you transition from a state of using glucose as your primary energy source to using ketones, that usually involves a gap in fuel flow to your brain, so your brain    tim ferriss   yeah, you feel grumpy and shitty   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    dominic d agostino   yeah, you have glucose withdrawal  i mean, your brain goes through glucose withdrawal  and it uses glucose not only for energy but to make neurotransmitters  your brain homeostasis is, you know, your glucose levels are basically telling your brain that it s happy  it s in a homeostatic state  so if you feed your body, your brain, ketones, it is preserving more or less that neurophysiological homeostasis, i think, and you re not going to have maybe a stress reaction  so, if you fast, and subjects that just kind of go cold turkey and fast, within the first 24 hours, it s a stress response  their cortisol level spikes  their sympathetic nervous system is activated  their immune system could be suppressed  and i think that if you were to do the same thing but use exogenous ketones, you would cruise into a state of nutritional ketosis, sustained nutritional ketosis without some of the bumps along the way   tim ferriss   got it   dominic d agostino   and i think that you could probably reap some of the performance benefits, and i think it would maybe be   but then you could, you know, you might make the argument that that stress, that physiological stress that you re giving yourself is, you know, you re familiar with the hormetic effect?  tim ferriss   yeah   dominic d agostino   then that stress could be kicking on mechanisms that, when activated, can kind of be protective in and of itself   tim ferriss   yeah, or beneficial in some way, right, like, when people are taking ibuprofen after workouts or other anti inflammatories and reducing subsequent hypertrophy, right, from    dominic d agostino   yeah, yeah   tim ferriss     inhibiting the sort of pain that was unpleasant in the short term but beneficial in the longer term   dominic d agostino   yeah, where, in the case of nsaids, if you dose them right after your workout, maybe those inflammatory mediators are linked to activating the signaling cascades that are responsible for the hypertrophy effect   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   right, right   dominic d agostino   so you could be negating that effect  but we have not shown that to be the case  actually, i think you could get a lot of benefit  i see it as not one or the other  i think the ketogenic diet actually goes pretty well with exogenous ketones, and one would not have to be on such a strict ketogenic diet because it is very restrictive   tim ferriss   it is   dominic d agostino   and you could do a modified atkins, which is kind of the way i think we should eat anyway, i mean, just eliminating all processed carbohydrates and just protein, fat, veggies is kind of how i eat, and i pretty much always stay in a state of ketosis just by using mcts, like a little bit of exogenous ketones here and there  and i think it would allow us to optimize the therapeutic effects of the ketogenic diet and probably further augment the therapeutic efficacy if we re talking about the clinical realm and maybe further augment the performance enhancing effects of the ketogenic diet too  and i think that s possible  but a lot of people just want something in a pill  and we have kind of   we did that study   well, we re doing those studies now  and i m a big fan of the ketogenic diet, and i m actually pretty impressed and even   shocked isn t the word, but we re getting results better than i expected just by giving pure ketones  i thought that you would need a level of adaptation to being in a state of nutritional ketosis to get the benefits from exogenous ketones, and that s not the case  we showed that really in our first study   tim ferriss   now, is that true even in the presence of higher carbohydrate intake or higher protein intake?  dominic d agostino   yeah, it is in our animal models, and we think it is in humans right now  so we have some studies approved where we re going to be looking at that in humans, looking at the metabolic effects   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    but kind of the first study that we did was a rat study where we did an acute feeding  well, it s kind of a gavage, so we kind of give them a bolus dose  and these are rats that are maintained on a high carbohydrate, standard rodent chow  and they ve never been in a state of ketosis before, unless they were deprived of food or something, which they probably weren t  so they ve never really seen ketones before  and in this study that we did, we acutely gave them a ketone ester, and within about 15 minutes to 30 minutes, they achieved a level of ketosis that would take about seven days of fasting for a human  they were in the 4 to 5 millimolar range  tim ferriss   and the bolus was, i mean, a high dose single    dominic d agostino   yeah, ketone ester, yes   tim ferriss   and what was the ketone ester?  dominic d agostino   it was   you want the chemical name?  tim ferriss   or maybe i should take a different approach  for people listening, what is a ketone ester?  dominic d agostino   okay  so your body makes primarily two ketones that it uses for fuel  one is acetoacetate, and another is betahydroxybutyrate  and they re both kind of interchangeable, and they re converted to one another in the body  beta hydroxybutyrate actually has to break down to acetoacetate to be used for energy  but the betahydroxybutyrate tends to be the primary   the highest level primary ketone in our body, just because it s more stable  but it does need to break down to acetoacetate  so a ketone ester is taking one of these, acetoacetate or betahydroxybutyrate or both, and taking those molecules and attaching it to something with an ester bond that functions as like more or less a carrier to it  so you can esterify a ketone with a wide range of things  you could use glycerol  you can use   we use something called 1,3 butanediol  and you can attach ketone molecules to this with a transesterification reaction   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and when it s ingested in the body, there s various enzymes  we have hydrolytic enzymes that will   esterases that will break off the ketone, and you ll get   when you ingest it orally, you ll start to liberate the ketones from the molecule that it s esterified with, and these will build up in your blood  and the idea, right, is to have a molecule that slowly releases the ketones in a very predictable fashion where you get a nice pharmacokinetic profile where you can take it orally, and within 10 to 15 minutes, you re in starvation ketosis, and then you stay in ketosis for 6, 8, 12 hours is ideal  and it depends on the molecule you re talking about  so that s kind of what we re doing now where we re kind of screening various compounds to figure out which ones have a favorable pharmacokinetic profile in isolation  and then we start combining them together so we can get formulas where we hit the ideal formula for a particular application  so a ketone ester, yeah, is a ketone that is orally active, so you can take it and it can increase blood ketone levels  in the rat study that i was describing, they are quickly put into ketosis  and then in that particular study, we would dive them in a hyperbaric chamber and increase the pressure and the level of oxygen within the chamber  so it would simulate a navy seal diving down to 132 feet of seawater breathing 100 percent oxygen in a rebreather that they use  it s called a draeger rebreather  tim ferriss   yeah, and the purpose of that of course is so that they don t give away location by having bubbles come out of their system  is that    dominic d agostino   yeah, so there s definitely a stealth component to a closedcircuit rebreather  if you re using it and you re in the middle of a pond in the middle of the jungle and it s perfectly quiet, you would not know the person s under there  whereas, if you re using standard scuba, you would see a bubble trail coming across the pond at you, and you could just sit there patiently and wait till they come out and shoot them  so, with a rebreather, there s a big advantage, a stealth component   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    the disadvantage is obviously if you go down to just 50 feet of seawater, you re at the risk of getting what s called oxygen toxicity seizures within, like, 10 to 15 minutes just at 50 feet  tim ferriss   wow   dominic d agostino   so you have to stay very shallow, which is not always hard to do during a mission if you have helicopters over you and they can see you in the water, or you re taking fire, or you ve got to dive down to plant a mine on a bridge or a ship  it s not always easy to do  so we developed these things for providing resilience and safety and performance   tim ferriss   now, when you say developed these things, you re talking about the exogenous ketones?  dominic d agostino   yeah, they re developed originally with that application in mind, with sort of a defense application in mind, a military application, and that s how my project originally got started   tim ferriss   because you ve had studies funded by the department of defense and so on  is that right?  dominic d agostino   yeah, the original idea for this was i got turned on to the ketogenic diet because it was used for drug resistant seizures  and my program officer, i ran the idea by him, and he didn t really like the idea of a diet per se  i mean, his attitude of the diet for performance has changed over the years  but he was, like, well, why don t you kind of look into developing a ketogenic diet in a pill and see if that s even possible? so i spent   and that was, like, 2008  and then that kind of started my journey into seeing if this was possible  and when we tested it in our rat model, i remember the first time we did it  we fed the rat and put him in there, and we typically see a seizure in about 10 to 15 minutes  and we re standing around the chamber, and we have a video camera system and a little window port  and we re standing there, and it s, like, 30 minutes has gone by, 40 minutes, and we re up to an hour  and everybody s just kind of looking at one another   tim ferriss   whoa   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    dominic d agostino   this is unbelievable  and i wasn t getting excited  i was, like, okay, calm down, calm down  this could be a major outlier or something  and then every single rat we ve ever done   and we ve done many rats   every single rat has gone way beyond the control to where the average is that it can resist oxygen toxicity 575 percent  and that sort of blows away any anticonvulsant drug out there, so similar to the ketogenic diet, right? if you go to the charlie foundation website, the charlie foundation was set up   working with johns hopkins university   is for kids with drug resistant seizures  and the study published   the original study by john freeman  it s published   showed that in kids that have failed all standard of care, all even combinations of, like, six anti seizure drugs, when they re put on the ketogenic diet, two thirds of those kids have seizure control, like, remarkable seizure control  and a percentage of them, like, a third of them have absolutely no seizures, like, a 95 percent reduction in seizures  so it made sense  so i was actually thinking that, well, the original study design was to feed ketone esters for a week and then dive them  but my source was only making a little bit at a time, the chemist that i got to make the product for me  so i had little tiny vials of it  and i was, like, well, i don't know, i was just kind of impatient  and i was, like, instead of getting enough to feed it for a week, i was, like, let s just try to give it one dose and see what happens  and when it worked, we were just blown away  so we did, like, three or four rats, and i was, like, okay, i m convinced, but completely unscientific, right, because usually you ve got to do, like, 12 and do stats and everything and do controls, but i was   because we dove, like, four rats, and they all went way beyond any other rat we ve ever seen  so i was, like, i have to move on this fast, or someone s going to kind of take this idea or something  i was, like, we ve got to move on this finding as fast as possible   tim ferriss   well, it seems also, i mean   and just like my ridiculous potassium instead of sodium remark earlier, definitely verbally club me over the head if i do anything like that   but it seems  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    like when you re evaluating the statistical significance of a given study, the sort of civilians, like, non scientists will say, oh, well, how big was your sample size? and it s like, oh, it was six or ten  and they re, like, oh, well, that s so small, you know, kind of  and they ll say it should be 100 or it should be 1,000  and they really don t know about science, and i should probably put myself in that category too  but if you have a huge magnitude of effect that is consistent across a smaller subject size, it can still be statistically significant, can it not? dominic d agostino   yeah, it depends on your sample population, you know, what kind of statistical power you have, or the likelihood too that the study will detect an effect, you know, is the statistical power  and you really have to sit down with a statistician and look at the probability of making a type 2 error or concluding that there s no effect  and i know just the   you know, i took the basic stats class, but i still consult with a statistician when we re designing a study for a proposal or something like that  and you kind of   you need to run it by   because if you don t do it beforehand, the reviewers that are reviewing your paper, there s always that statistician that s part of the review committee who will ding you on it and be, like, no, we re not passing it  you ve got to go back and do two more animals for this group  and then it s, like, ah, that could set you back, like, a year and a half in a published study  so you always want to do that upfront   tim ferriss   yeah, i mean, especially   i was looking at   with some mutual friends of ours, looking at a study involving beet juice intake and endurance gains  and they were using a small sample size of extremely highlevel endurance athletes  and if you were to take the results, it was, like, a 2 percent performance increase or whatever and try to convey it, it sounds extremely unimpressive  but the entire study was underpowered in some fatal ways  but the question for you   so i enjoy scuba, but scuba can be dangerous, right? who knows? so you get snagged on  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    something, or let s say you re   let s just take a different scenario  so, instead of using a rebreather with pure oxygen, right, so an excess of oxygen, you risk running out of oxygen, right, or excess of co2 levels  let s say you re a free diver and trying to break records  would taking a sort of single large dose, like a bolus of exogenous ketones or ketone esters before a record attempt be   would that be a rational sort of insurance policy, or would that in any way help mitigate potential damage? dominic d agostino   yeah, that s a really good question  so our lab, in addition to looking at oxygen, we also look at what s called hypercapnia, which is high co2 levels, because if you re in a spaceship that s headed to mars or you re in a submarine, the level of co2 that you re experiencing is about on an order of ten times higher  so that s something that we re looking at  but when it comes to oxygen utilization, i guess one the studies you could refer to is peter attia s blog where we look at   we ve kind of set the work  peter took a ketone salt that we had, kind of a crude version of it, and i commend peter for his bravery in downing this   tim ferriss   this is the jet fuel that made him dry heave in the kitchen?  dominic d agostino   yeah  so, yeah, if you look at his blog there, yeah, and i think the title is jet fuel, and you look at the oxygen consumption for a given work output   in his case, it was on a bike at 180 watts   he had roughly five to eight percent decrease in oxygen consumption for a given work output  so showing that your oxygen utilization was lower, and so your oxygen   your metabolic efficiency, so that s kind of the take home is that you can potentially enhance metabolic efficiency  so i can tell you that when i fasted for one week, i do a lot of snorkeling and a lot of diving and just kind of watersports, and out of curiosity, i was swimming around in the pool at my house, and i noticed i could stay under longer  and i told my girlfriend, now my fianc e, it s like, i want to do an experiment and measure   i knew what my breath hold time  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    was, and then in a fasted state i had never checked it before  so i was able to stay down for three and a half minutes, i think, almost four minutes, which is, like, well beyond double my breath hold time  and it was really remarkable  so being in a state of pretty intense ketosis allowed me to withstand levels of hypoxia  tim ferriss   what was your millimolars at the time? do you know?  dominic d agostino   yeah, i was running    tim ferriss   or roughly?  dominic d agostino   yeah, i was running between 4 to 5 5   tim ferriss   oh, wow, you were up there   dominic d agostino   but i m a good ketone user too, so i would be, if i m sitting at my desk, so that s what i would kind of be registering, but if i got up and took a brisk walk around campus or around my place or something, that would drop down to, like, 2 because i think the peripheral uptake of ketones would be higher   tim ferriss   you also have a lot of mass you re walking around with   dominic d agostino   yeah  and i think we build our transport and mechanisms of ketones with time, so the mono   it s called the monocarboxylate transporter, sort of the protein that gets the ketones across the membrane and allows cells to use it, is upregulated over time  so the longer you re on a ketogenic diet, the more benefits you could potentially derive from it because your body is adapting to that state of ketosis by upregulating transporter mechanisms  and a few of my colleagues study this  and at least in a rodent model, it takes about four weeks, and you could actually double the protein level  the actual subunits of the proteins that are part of the transporter goes up about 50 percent when you transition an animal to a ketogenic diet for four weeks  so that s a pretty remarkable    tim ferriss   that is   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    dominic d agostino     increase in the potential of utilizing ketones as an energy source  and i think some of the work by jeff volek   i just had an opportunity to visit him at ohio state just last week, and he s done some remarkable work just showing between fat adapted athletes and carb adapted athletes, and they re both at elite levels  if you look at substrate utilization between these two groups, it s like night and day  even the best carb adapted athletes, they re the ones that are using fat at the highest level, are using much less fat than the fat adapted athletes, than the guys that are on the ketogenic diet  i mean, they re literally using about two to three times more fat during exercise  and i think that s what happens  so i think resting and just kind of being in a calm state and letting your sympathetic nervous system kind of chill out and having a good   diving is   a lot of mental preparation goes into diving  but i ve found that if i can just kind of calm my body down, and if i m in the state of nutritional ketosis, fasting ketosis, i could increase my breath hold time by, like, three times, like, 300 percent  and that blows my mind, so i need to study this   tim ferriss   i ve also replicated that myself in two different experiments  i mean, it s an n of 1, but, yeah, the magnitude of difference, it s kind of like you re a rat swimming around for an hour instead of 25 minutes or 15 minutes rather, double or triple breath hold time at even low 1s, like 1 3 millimolars  even on a very strict, calorically restricted ketogenic diet, i very rarely get past 3 unless i m ingesting stuff that facilitates it, meaning supplemental ketones, mct oil, etc  but question for you on the adaptation  i m so interested in this  so, for instance, people talk about muscle memory, right, where people regain weight faster, muscle weight after they ve gained it once before, even if they lose, say, 50, 60 pounds like casey viator did at one point, and then regained it, and they re, like, oh, well, that s muscle memory  and some people, at least based on reading i ve done, attribute that to satellite cell growth and so on that happened the first  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    time around that facilitate this kind of regrowth  so there s a persistent benefit to that one time event  what is the persistence of the upregulation after four weeks of being on keto? so let s say you stay on a strict keto diet for four to six weeks  you upregulate these proteins and therefore sort of the uptake or transport by 50 percent  if you stopped that and didn t follow a ketogenic diet again for another six months, is there a persistence of effect, or if you had to guess, what would you say? dominic d agostino   yeah, anecdotally, i would say yes   tim ferriss   cool, yeah   dominic d agostino   i mean, there s just some memory going on here and, yeah, if you just   if you use ketone levels as kind of an index for this, like your body s ability to make ketones, it s definitely better  like, if you re on a ketogenic diet and you break ketosis and go eat sushi for a couple days and come back, i can get into ketosis real quick, relative to the big learning curve i had when i started doing this  so i would say yeah  i m not sure we ve studied it to that extent i think you re referring to, but that brings up a good question because a lot of people want to go in and out of ketosis  like, can i just use this intermittently? can i eat ketogenic but just throw in carbs during my workout? and people say, well, should i be on a ketogenic diet all the time? should i always be in nutritional ketosis? and i tend to be in that state because i just feel better generally in a moderate state of ketosis  but i think it s probably good too, to have metabolic flexibility, for your body to be able to use all sorts of food for energy  so going in and out of ketosis may be optimal to get your body in and out  and i do that from time to time depending on   you know, i ll be traveling  i ll be in europe the next two or three weeks actually, so trying different foods  so i ll probably get out of ketosis  but i actually travel with ketone supplements too, so i kind of cheat along the way   tim ferriss   so if you go to italy and you re eating bread and pasta, what are the main benefits   i m making that assumption, but that s  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    what i would do because i m a glutton and love carbs when it comes down to it   but if you went to went to italy and were consuming all of that, what is the benefit of ingesting the exogenous ketones, and how would you ingest them? dominic d agostino   okay  depends on kind of the person, what you wanted to   if you were working out or whatever  but just for general health and energy    tim ferriss   i would say for your personal use  so, if you could describe sort of how much you re working out, just in a scenario like that, right, you re traveling with these exogenous ketones  how do you use them and why?  dominic d agostino   okay  well, there s two that i kind of bring with me  one would be a mct powder, and it s basically caprylic triglyceride, like a brain octane but a powdered form of it  and i m kind of   it s not on the market yet, but i just kind of have it  and i use the ketocana product that s put out by ketosports  it s kind of the first thing i take when i get up  well, i drink a glass of water, and then i take some   a small amount of ketones to bump me up to about 1 millimolar, and then i eat a ketogenic diet breakfast   tim ferriss   and that s the combination of the mct powder and the ketocana or ketocana   god, i need to   it s like gymkhana, like that horrible but awesome movie i saw ages ago   dominic d agostino   yeah   tim ferriss   okay, all right, ketocana, is that how you guys say it? okay   dominic d agostino   ketocana, yeah   tim ferriss   so do you combine those two when you first get up and take it with water?  dominic d agostino   i do sometimes, not all the time  sometimes i ll just take the straight mct powder   tim ferriss   got it   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    dominic d agostino   it just kind of depends on my mood or whatever  but i always take   mcts are so versatile, and they re so cheap and so readily available  traveling with mct oil is not really that good, but so the powder is something that i ve been testing, and i really love it  and the powder, the huge advantage of an mct powder, especially caprylic triglyceride, is that with straight mct oil, i m running to the bathroom, you know, when i   on an empty stomach, or if i try to get my levels up to above 1 millimolar, above whatever baseline i m at  whereas, the mct powder that i m working   that s being formulated and tested is sort of spray dried with a probiotic fiber that s healthy for your microbiome and has some interesting properties in and of itself  but it allows you   the powder increases tolerability, at least double or triples it   tim ferriss   wow   dominic d agostino   so it allows you to kind of cruise along at an extra 2 millimolar and stay there  and then you could take the powder and then add some ketocana to it or some other ketone salt products that we re developing and basically, i mean, you re approaching the potency of a ketone ester  the ketone esters will probably always be the most potent molecules out there  it ll be hard to touch that  but some of the more palatable ketone salt products that are being developed and tested now, and we re working really hard to make them tolerable and palatable, will be able to approach the potency of the esters that are developed for military applications, which i think is really exciting because they re going to taste   they re actually   you ll look forward to tasting them  they re that good  and they can put you into that mild ketosis range, that 1 to 3 millimolar independent of carbohydrate restriction or fasting  so you will have the ability to derive a lot of the benefits, whether it be health, longevity, performance, of ketosis, of higher levels of ketosis than you could otherwise get with any kind of mct oil out there or anything out there  so i will bring that with me when i travel  and so i ll be in budapest and belgium and a few other places along the way  and i will probably not be eating keto  i ll be eating low carb  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    but not keto  but i ll be cruising around at probably 2 to 3 millimolar, more or less off of a ketogenic diet, low carb but not ketogenic  tim ferriss   so you ll take your mct powder in the morning with water, then you ll have a keto breakfast  what does the breakfast look like?  dominic d agostino   this morning, i had eggs  i usually have four eggs and some kind of fish  i m a big believer   i ve kind of   i eat beef, but i ve been phasing out beef and chicken and probably getting about twothirds of my protein from fish  so i had eggs and fish in the form of sardines and a half of a can of oysters  i ve been on this oyster kick for a while   tim ferriss   why is that?  dominic d agostino   oysters? well, they re like a nutrition powerhouse, right? so are sardines  so i get the sardines packed in olive oil  but they re really high in micronutrients like selenium, which are things that are maybe hard to get from other sources out there, but i just like the taste of them too  so sardines are really good to travel with  they re in my travel food too  so whenever my bag is packed, i usually have about a dozen cans of sardines packed in extra virgin olive oil  so i tend to just   i like them so much i eat them when i m home too  so i have, yeah, fish and eggs and some kind of green, usually asparagus, broccoli or spinach or kale  and if i make kale, i like to cook bacon and i cook the kale in the bacon grease  but i didn t do that this morning, but i ll probably do that tomorrow  so that s what i had for breakfast  but before i eat breakfast, i always kind of drink water first, and i take branched chain amino acids with the ketone products that i just told you about  and that kind of gets energy to my brain immediately, and i m kind of really good to go after that  and usually   well, before that, i let my dog out and he just kind of goes crazy, so i kind of run around and watch him chase animals off our property, so that s always an entertaining  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    thing while coffee s   or i got water brewing for my coffee, and i got my breakfast cooking  so that usually goes on in the morning  but, yeah, i always   my breakfast is always pretty much ketogenic  and if i have coffee, i do put butter in it, and i put mct powder in it on top of the butter, so it s very ketogenic  and the macronutrient ratio of my breakfast is always about 70 to 80 percent fat with the balance being protein and a little bit of carbs from whatever green vegetables i have  tim ferriss   and the bcaas, what brand are you using?  dominic d agostino   yeah, i use scivation   tim ferriss   how do you spell that?  dominic d agostino   yeah, it s short for science and innovation, so s c i v a t io n, right, yeah, scivation  so scivation has been an incredible supporter of our cancer research program  so, as you know, getting funding to do metabolic therapy research or research on diets and nutrition and just basically cancer metabolism in general, just people don t study it  the ceo of scivation is a close friend of mine, and he has been, for personal reasons and just kind of scientific reasons, he has supported our cancer research program  and his branched chain amino acid product is called xtend, and it s probably the most popular one out there, and it s on probably the most popular on bodybuilding com  and it s actually the product that we re using in our cancer studies  so he asked me   he contacted me and wanted me to study this, and i looked at the formula, and it had a high amount of glutamine in it  so i said, you know, i want to study this, but let s remove the glutamine and just do pure branched chain amino acids  and i think he replaced the glutamine and put some taurine in it or whatever, and we started with that  and we added branched    copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   now, is that because the glutamine is glucogenic, or what was the reason for removing the old glutamine?  dominic d agostino   yeah, i should describe   so cancer cells kind of default to a metabolic phenotype called the warburg effect, right? so they basically derive most of their energy from glucose metabolism  and their biosynthetic processes, as a tumor grows, it s using glucose for energy, but it s also using glucose to expand the biomass of the tumor  so it becomes the primary source of energy  and we knew this for some time, and that sort of underlies the basis of using what s called a pet scan for imaging the location and the aggressiveness of a tumor in imaging, an fdg pet scan  so it basically shows sugar metabolism or glucose metabolism  so now, investigators understand that the amino acid glutamine is also used at a fairly high concentration relative to other amino acids, i guess i would say, by cancer cells  and we call that glutaminolysis  so cancer cells can use glucose, primarily glucose, but they can also use glutamine  and this is understood now and kind of well defined in the literature  but we know that glutamine, i mean, some formulas actually promote or hospitals will promote giving iv glutamine or oral glutamine to cancer patients  that s not necessarily proven to be a bad thing, but i think i was airing on the side of caution by removing the glutamine from the xtend product, at least for our studies  and we wanted to go back and do a parallel study with the glutamine actually to see if the    tim ferriss   and the iv glutamine in the hospitals is for waste   for an anticatabolic purpose, or is it for some type of recovery purpose? why are they doing that in the first place?  dominic d agostino   yeah, glutamine is    tim ferriss   because i know a lot of people take glutamine post workout, for instance   dominic d agostino   yeah  if you re ingesting it, the gut pretty much   the gut and the liver, i think, probably are pretty greedy and take their share  i m not sure how much glutamine you re actually getting to the muscles when you do that   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    but glutamine, i would say, is a conditionally essential amino acid, so under periods of high stress or catabolic physiological state, your body will use more glutamine  glutamine is also an important amino acid for maintaining your immune system  so it plays a   i would say if you re deficient in glutamine, it can compromise your immune system  so you want to make sure that if your immune system is challenged, which it would be if you have cancer, or you re getting chemotherapy, if you re a burn patient, you re going to want   you might want glutamine, although we re testing a hypothesis that we want to metabolically starve cancer cells in our experiment and preserve muscle at the same time  so the xtend product that s out there by scivation is a remarkable product  i think people like it because it tastes so good  so the people who formulate the product really know what they re doing with taste  so it tastes really, really good  and if you want a successful product, it doesn t matter if it cures cancer or enhances your performance ten times over  if it doesn t taste good, people are not going to take it  so the scivation branched chain amino acids, they taste really good, but they re also very tolerable and very palatable  but this particular product had glutamine, so we removed it from the formula for our studies, and we ran a study with a ketogenic diet, and we added the branched chain amino acid to the ketogenic diet  and we looked at survival of mice with advanced metastatic cancer  and adding the branched chain amino acid to the ketogenic diet, we had like a 50 percent increase in survival with the ketogenic diet alone  and when we added branched chain amino acids to the ketogenic diet, there was trends for an increase in survival, but i think the big thing is that we saw the animals were maintaining their weight better with the branched chain amino acids added to it  so, with branched chain amino acids, one of them is leucine, and we know leucine can activate mtor, and mtor has been  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    associated with driving, a major driver for cancer growth and proliferation  and there s cancer biologists out there that would say, well, if you give leucine, you re just going to drive cancer because you re stimulating an anabolic process that can drive cancer growth and proliferation  but i would kind of argue that that s not the case here  we definitely don t see it in this model, and some of the other studies out there do not show that branched chain amino acids cause cancer to grow faster, and some of it shows the opposite actually  but i think branched chain amino acids have   their effect on anabolic processes are relatively specific to skeletal muscle, and i think that s really important to understand is that stimulating anabolic processes is not a global effect, is that it s kind of similar to anabolic steroids right? so there s specific receptors on the muscles  we think that the   tim ferriss   right, and that s also why if you take a sort of less selective growth agonist, you end up looking like you re seven months  pregnant as a bodybuilder because your intestines are the size of your forearms, yeah   dominic d agostino   yeah, igf 1 is great for growing your skin and your organs, yeah, so it has a pretty global systemic anabolic effect, whereas   and we haven t proven this yet, but i think just based on literature and we re really delving into it, we think that the branched chain amino acids will be relatively specific for skeletal muscle  and to look at this, we re going to feed animals the branchedchain amino acids, and then we take the actual tumor tissue out, and then we do a series of metabolic analysis and assays and everything to look at the signaling and the insulin signaling, the metabolomics, the growth factors and whatnot and compare it to the groups without the branched chain amino acids  so we re really delving mechanistically into this   tim ferriss   which is something i love and enjoy about your research and our conversations is that, i mean, you have a lot of expertise in  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    neurochemistry, neurobiology, cancer chemistry, but would you consider yourself a nutritionist? dominic d agostino   you know, as an undergrad, i enthusiastically went into a nutrition science program at rutgers university, and my   who would you call it? i guess my guidance counselor at the time just wasn t a very interesting person  and it was like, well, i kept going to her, and i said, well, direct me to labs that are doing interesting nutrition science research  and there wasn t a whole lot going on  i mean, i like rutgers and everything, but there just wasn t a whole lot of stuff going on there that really interested me  and the more people i talked to   i was kind of going the premed route, and people were like, well, yeah, you should probably major in biology too  so i double majored in nutrition and biological sciences  but i really had a passion for nutrition  and then when i went into a phd program, it was neuroscience because i was really fascinated with the brain but also did physiology, and i studied the neurocontrol of autonomic regulations, so how the brain controls our body, our physiology  and then i started   did my postdoc in looking at physiological resilience and the oxygen toxicity thing, and it brought me back full circle because when i started   i was basically a pharmacologist as a neuroscientist trying to find a drug that would mitigate oxygen toxicity seizures  and i m looking at all these drugs, and i realize that they re not very good  they would be good if you give them at a dose that would sedate a warfighter and basically put them into a coma, and it s not very  inaudible     tim ferriss   wouldn t be a way to prevent seizures   dominic d agostino     ideal situation, yeah  but then when i discovered the ketogenic diet, and i wasn t really excited when i first discovered it  i was like, let me see the research on this  there s a lot of things out there  but the research on it was so cut and dry  i mean, there was an on overwhelming amount of scientific research showing the efficacy of the ketogenic diet for drug resistant pediatric  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    seizures and now in adults too  and i realized, wow, this is like the most powerful metabolic therapy out there for seizures, like bar none  and i was, like, i realized this was grossly underutilized, and if i could harness the power of this and apply it to something as esoteric as cns oxygen toxicity, that would be really cool  so i could kind of bring back my passion for nutrition, which was always there  i always, even throughout grad school and postdoc, i was totally into working out and nutrition and understanding different diets and trying lots of stuff on myself  it allowed me to kind of come full circle and incorporate nutrition research into my research now  so our entire research program is really based on the ketogenic diet  so we do ketogenic diet studies, exogenous ketones, but we also do metabolic drugs  so we do metformin and a few other drugs  tim ferriss   well, and a lot of   i mean, you mentioned metformin as sort of a regulator of liver glycogen, hepatic glycogen   dominic d agostino   yeah   tim ferriss   and there are plenty of folks who take metformin   is it still called glucophage or glucophage   i m not sure the brand name   but the metformin prophylactically? i mean, these are otherwise what you d consider healthy people who are taking it primarily to prevent cancer growth, if i m not mistaken  i mean, is that fair to say, or are they using it for other purposes?  dominic d agostino   yeah, you can use it for a variety of reasons  you could use it as kind of a metabolic prophylactic to prevent you from getting type 2 diabetes down the road  but when it comes to cancer, yeah, it definitely activates or dampens or activates signaling pathways associated with cancer growth and proliferation  and if you re activating ampakines, which it s well known to do that, and activate various downstream signaling processes, it mimics in many ways calorie restriction and fasting, the same processes that would be activated   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    it comes with some side effects, and some people have intolerance to it, you know, gi issues with it  but overall, it s a really safe drug  i mean, so many prescriptions have been written for it  we know what it does and what it doesn t do  we don t really   the cancer   there s a lot of research in cancer right now  and when you go to a cancer conference, you hear there s a lot of discussion, a lot of buzz about metformin, but there s also a lot of debate as to how it s working  so some people think it s toxic to the mitochondria and it s inhibiting complex 1 of the mitochondria  and other people are saying it works purely by activating ampakines, and other people by its ability to regulate hepatic glucose output or a combination, and some people through other mechanisms  so we don t know how it works, but i think   i did a run where i took 1 gram of metformin for   i think it was 12 weeks, and i got bloodwork  and the only thing i saw was that my testosterone was lower  so i think that s a side effect  i have since got off of it, and i rechecked and my testosterone levels are back into the normal range that they were  and that s the only thing   tim ferriss   did you feel any fatigue?  dominic d agostino   no, i didn t  well, i felt   i don't know how to describe it   a little   maybe a little less anxious, a little bit   kind of like you kind of set the governor  like, my highs weren t as high  and i would kind of dose it   i d dose it twice a day  and my bigger dose would be at nighttime before i went to bed because that would be my bigger meal  so i would kind of dose the metformin according to my food intake, which i think is important  but, yeah, i didn t really notice any side effects  i went up to 2 grams a day initially and found out, okay, that s about my tolerance to it, so i backed down to one   tim ferriss   now, so to gut tolerance, meaning to disaster pants, like, risk? is that    copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    dominic d agostino   not the mct effect, not what i would describe as the mct effect   tim ferriss   okay, all right, all right   dominic d agostino   but it s kind of like a dull kind of aching feeling in the stomach  but, yeah, there were, like, loose stools a little bit, and then i just kind of   the next day, i backed off, and i played around with it for probably two or three weeks  and then i realized, okay, 1 gram is about what i can do safely and comfortably, i thought  a and, yeah, i did that for three months, and i tried to take nothing else at the time  i wasn t experimenting with any other things  and i took that, and my testosterone went down  but my other   like, my triglycerides were the lowest ever  my hdl was, like, 98   tim ferriss   wow   dominic d agostino   it bumped up from, like, 88 to 98  and other things, like my creactive protein wasn t even measurable  and i tried not to calorie restrict or even change my diet at all  so some things went in a positive direction, but i really thought that it suppressed my testosterone  and there was a couple publications that would indicate that it does that  you know, maybe if i took 500 grams a day, it wouldn t   or 500 milligrams a day, it wouldn t have that effect  but i felt  inaudible  a gram a day  and i had, like, a powdered version, so it was probably, like one to 1 5 grams a day  i was kind of measuring out with a powdered version  so it was at least 1 gram a day i was taking  so that s my experience with it, and i know a few people out there   if cancer runs in your family and you are concerned that you may be at risk or maybe had cancer in the past, i think it s a pretty safe drug to take  one of my students is a phd student, and his entire phd dissertation is on metformin  so we re looking at it, you know, very deep kind of understanding of metformin as much as you can in a phd dissertation   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    so we delve over the literature  we re running studies in individual cells in isolation in advanced cancer models  and we have a pretty good understanding of what it does and what it doesn t do  and in our metastatic cancer model, we have survival times increased almost 40 to 50 percent increase in survival  and you have to give a pretty big dose  tim ferriss   now, metastatic, is that with some   you re talking about metformin?  dominic d agostino   yeah, it s metformin to a standard diet increases the survival times of animals that have metastatic cancer  we ve presented this at several meetings, and we re finishing up the data now to publish it, which will be published pretty soon   tim ferriss   and does that include in the animal models   i m not sure if this is in the animal, but, like, glioblastoma multiforme, like, the gbm, sort of the uniformly   what are considered kind of the uniformly fatal cancers, is that also   do you still see the 40 to 50 percent?  dominic d agostino   yeah, so it s interesting  so the metastatic cancer model that we have, the primary tumor is derived from a tumor that pathologists confirmed was a glioblastoma  what s interesting about these cancer cells are so aggressive that we have them in culture, right? we have isolated subcultures of these cells that are metastatic and very aggressive  and they re transfected with a gene that makes the protein luciferase  so it basically makes the cells glow in the presence of luciferin  so not to get too complicated, but if we take these cells in culture, right, we harvest them and we implant them inside the flank of the animal or underneath the skin, the cells metastasize to all the organs and even the brain  so, typically, a glioblastoma is thought not to metastasize the other organs of the body, and it stays in the brain  but i think we don t typically see people with glioblastoma with liver cancer because they die of the glioblastoma before it metastasizes  so we ve basically   and this is a model that was generated by thomas seyfried from boston college  he wrote the book,  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    cancer as a metabolic disease  it s a really, really good book  it s, like, required reading for all my students  but he developed this model and made the cover of international journal of cancer  and it s probably the best model out there, so it s why we chose the model  but it s a model of advanced metastatic cancer  and the primary tumor had a glioblastoma kind of cell type to it  and these cells were kind of described as tumor associated macrophages, so they can travel along blood vessels  they can metastasize to organs very aggressively  and it makes it a convenient model to use because when you implant the cells, the experiment goes real fast, right, because the animal succumbs to the tumor burden within about 21 days  so we can test and we can basically test a lot of things really fast because the tumors grow so fast  within 21 days, we have to put the animal down because it ll succumb to the tumor burden  so it allows us to test various drugs and diets and ketogenic agents  and when we tested metformin with a standard highcarbohydrate rat chow, and we formulated it into the food, so it would be equivalent to a person taking about 2 5 grams a day   so metformin comes in, like, 500 milligram tablets, i think even sometimes one gram tablets, so with the 500 milligram tablets, it would be taking, like, five tablets a day would be the human equivalent to that  the animals lived about 50 percent longer, about 45 to 50 percent longer survival time  so, instead of living 21 days, they lived almost 40 days  tim ferriss   that s amazing   dominic d agostino   so what we re doing now   so we have to tediously test all these things in isolation, and then we have to do different dose ranges too, right? so we ve got to do a variety of dose ranges and make all these dose curves and everything  but i just want to jump right into it  i want to do a calorierestricted ketogenic diet with ketone supplementation and metformin and hyperbaric oxygen  i want to jump right to it   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and we re kind of doing some of these things as pilots, but we re testing   i think it s really important to get a handle on what each of these things do at different dosages  tim ferriss   no, definitely  let me   i apologize for interrupting, but if you   and you would figure this out earlier of course   but if you found out you had relatively advanced cancer of some aggressive type, what are the tools that you would throw at it that you have a decent degree of confidence would have a beneficial effect? so you mentioned a few things, right? you mentioned calorierestricted ketogenic diet, so i d love to hear what calorierestricted means, right? you mentioned metformin  you mentioned hyperbaric oxygen treatment  you mentioned exogenous ketones  we talked earlier about fasting  but let s just say you found out, oh, shit, i m in a bad situation here, and this is a very, very aggressive cancer  putting aside the chemotherapy and some of the other therapies that you might have administered, of the toolkits that we ve been discussing, what would you do?  dominic d agostino   okay  well, so i m not the kind of person   some of my colleagues are kind of very anti standard of care, some of them for some ways  but i think you have to   i know you told me not to talk about chemo, but if you have something like testicular cancer or leukemia or lymphoma, there s a variety of cancers you d be crazy not to do the standard of care  so, when i talk about this, one could potentially use it as a standalone therapy, or one could use it as a way to further augment the efficacy of standard of care, which we plan to do   tim ferriss   for sure   dominic d agostino   so, say, worst case scenario, like glioblastoma, right, a glioblastoma, in some ways it s really a good model to look at because your survival time is, like, one year, give or take a few months  so it s almost   if we do a study with glioblastoma patients, it s almost like you have historical controls that you can refer to  so the ketogenic diet, i think would be absolutely like your base therapy, right? and it would be not just a macronutrient ratio  it would be the sources of the macronutrients itself  like,  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    you would have to   you would do a macronutrient ratio that would put you in ketosis but take extra care to get fish that was from a natural source or grass fed beef  and i think these things would probably be important because we know the fatty acid composition changes dramatically from a corn fed cow than a grass fed or a salmon that s farm raised or wild  so the ketogenic diet would be kind of the base  and instead of the normal three day or three times a day eating pattern, i would go to an intermittent fasting personally  and i think that would be   you could further harness the power of ketosis by fasting throughout the day and then having a ketogenic meal once a day  tim ferriss   so your single meal would be like a dinner?  dominic d agostino   it would be dinner, yeah  you would eat probably within a window of four hours  inaudible   and i ve experimented with that, and that s possible  i just like eating though, so i like sitting down and having a social breakfast, and i don t eat during the day, and then i have a nice sit down social kind of dinner at night  so i like that  so, either way, i think ideally i would probably do one meal a day  and ketone supplementation, i think   i mean, we ve shown, independent of even the ketogenic diet that ketones have an anti cancer effect  they not only do   our ketones cannot be utilized as an energy source by aggressive cancer cells that have defective mitochondria  so cancer cells cannot use ketones effectively as an energy source because they have defective mitochondria structurally  they re defective  if you look at the mitochondria of cells of a glioblastoma patient, the inner cristae, the little folds inside the mitochondria where atp is actually produced is completely screwed up  and they re also deficient in various catalytic enzymes that would allow the cancer cells to make energy from ketones  so ketones as a source of energy is a very poor energy source for cancer  so putting our body into a state of nutritional ketosis would be a way to marginalize the fuel source to ketones and enhance the energy capacity of our healthy cells  so exogenous ketones    copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   yeah  for you personally, how much would you take? when would you take them?  dominic d agostino   yeah, i would take a level of exogenous ketones that would put me above whatever baseline i was at, between 1 to 2 millimolars  so, if i m cruising along at, like, 1 5, staying on a modified atkins like diet, i would further boost that to, like, 3 or 3 5 with exogenous ketogenic agents  i think the easiest could be medium chain triglycerides, know, mct powder, which will be available soon, ketocana product  there ll be some products coming pretty soon, ketone salt products that ll taste really good will allow you to easily achieve this   you the out and  tim ferriss   how much would you have to take, you personally, to jack your ketone millimolar up 1 or 2 millimolars like you described? is it three times a day, twice a day? what type of dosing and frequency are we looking at?  dominic d agostino   i would do twice a day, probably twice a day or maybe three times a day depending  see, the mcts kind of allow you to maintain the levels up a little bit higher  but i think it s okay to not continuously provide an exogenous source of ketones, but maybe just use them when you need them if you need a boost in energy  so you might want to      tim ferriss   but if you had the glioblastoma, you would do two to three times a day?  dominic d agostino   yeah, i would do two to four times a day probably because the way kind of our experiments are panning out, it just looks like the stronger you stay in ketosis, the higher levels you get, the better tumor suppressor effects that you get  so, yeah, i would use them to the extent where i was pretty much constantly from the time i wake up keeping my ketones more or less artificially elevated  well, i guess it wouldn t be artificial if you re adding mcts, which are a good carrier for the other forms of exogenous ketones, to keep it further boosted an additional 1 to 2 millimolar minimum   tim ferriss   got it  and what about other things that you might do?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    dominic d agostino   yeah, the metformin  i would titrate metformin in to where it starts causing side effects and then back off from there   tim ferriss   so titrate meaning you d just start low and increase the dosage?  dominic d agostino   yeah, even, you know, you can get it in 250 milligram tablets or break the tablet in half and keep, you know, start out one week, maybe start at 500 and then go up to 750 and then to a gram, and then bump it up to where you start to get some gi discomfort and then back it off and then stay there  metformin s pretty cheap, pretty remarkable drug in our hands  and i think it would synergize with the other things that i m describing  so dca is another drug that we re looking at, and one could simply get on google and do a search for dichloroacetate, dca and cancer, and find a lot of interesting information  i think there s registered clinical trials going on right now with glioblastoma  and we think it may synergize with some of the things that i m talking about, even metformin  so dca activates a particular enzyme metabolic pathway, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, and for reasons we don t completely understand, it can cause cancer cells to   it kills them  it triggers apoptosis in cancer cells by reasons we don t completely have a handle on yet  but it s used clinically for lactic acidosis  and lactate can drive   or in the micro environment, lactate can drive tumor growth  so dca can actually make your body more alkaline, right? i mean, it s used clinically for that application  and maybe its therapeutic effects may have to do with that, but we know that if we just grow cancer cells in isolation, like a dissociated cell prep and put on dca, the cancer cells start to die and at levels that are relatively nontoxic to healthy cells  so dichloroacetate at   you know, i don t like to give recommendations, but if i was to   this is all theoretical    tim ferriss   no, this is for you and theoretical, yeah   dominic d agostino   yeah, i would start at, like, 10 milligrams per kilogram, and i m a little over 100 kilograms or whatever, so you could do the math on that   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and so i would start up to 10 milligrams per kilogram and probably not go higher than 50 milligrams per kilogram because once you get above 50 milligrams per kilogram of dca, you start to get peripheral neuropathy  and we see this in our animal models, and it s also reported in patients  if you go onto the forums of patients that have glioblastomas, they ll report tingling in the fingers and the toes at, like, once they start reaching about 50 milligrams per kilogram  i think the clinical trials use 20 milligrams per kilogram if i m not mistaken  so dca activates pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, so that complex makes the mitochondria   it activates the mitochondria  and if you active the mitochondria of cancer cells, which have defective mitochondria, it causes the mitochondria to, like, explode and the cancer cells, it triggers apoptosis  so it probably triggers the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, which is part of apoptotic pathway  tim ferriss   apoptosis, meaning cell death   dominic d agostino   yeah, programmed cell death   tim ferriss   programmed cell death   dominic d agostino   yeah, yeah  and that s kind of like a theory that i m throwing out there, but it s based on kind of what we know, what we see in the lab and what we know from the literature  but it s relatively a nontoxic drug, i mean relative to the chemotherapeutic agents that are   chemotherapy is   are highly carcinogenic  so when you re giving chemotherapy, you re giving a highly carcinogenic substance  so does it make sense to treat cancer with something that we know is a powerful carcinogen? it doesn t  in some cases, it does  like i mentioned, some of the    tim ferriss   testicular cancer   dominic d agostino     cancers i mentioned before, yeah, and there s application for it  but i think we have to view this in perspective  dca, i don t  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    think you can patent it  it s like a really simple molecule, dichloroacetate, right? you can kind of visualize it if you re a chemist  it s a pretty small, simple molecule  and it has a pretty powerful metabolic effect  and again, it works well by itself with a highcarbohydrate diet  so just think about how it may synergize with a ketogenic diet, exogenous ketones, you know, metformin, intermittent fasting  it s working through overlapping mechanisms  so you are further compromising sort of the energetic state of the cancer cells by adding it to the mix  tim ferriss   and if you had this   you re using this portfolio of techniques  so you re on a ketogenic diet  you re intermittent fasting  you re consuming exogenous ketones two to four times a day, enough to jack up sort of your ceiling by 1 to 2 millimolars  you re perhaps taking metformin in combination with dca  would fasting be additive to this, or would it be redundant in your mind?  dominic d agostino   i think it has its place, you know, and you may not want to do, depending on your overall health   like, my health, i can tolerate fasting pretty much every day  intermittent fasting would be no problem  but i think you could derive benefits by fasting two or three times a week, even once a week, i think could be beneficial  but i would try to do it   you know, some people do every other day fasting, but i think one meal a day is one way to go about doing it, or alternatively if that s too stressful, you could eat two or three meals one day, and then monday, wednesday, friday do one meal per day  but i think that gap in time, that 20 plus hours that you re not eating and that you have metformin in your system, you have dca in your system, and you have exogenous ketones kind of flooding your bloodstream, i mean, it s putting your physiology   it s putting your metabolic physiology into a state that s compromising the tumor tissue  and i always   and i discussed this with my colleague, thomas seyfried, he thinks that if you don t have cancer and you do a therapeutic fast once or twice a year or maybe three  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    times a year if it s a shorter fast that it would purge any precancerous cells that may be living in your body  so, if you put your physiology into a state of fasting ketosis, that puts tremendous metabolic stress on cancer cells that are highly dependent for survival and growth on high levels of glucose and insulin  by subtracting them of those growth needs, they can trigger apoptosis autophagy, and you could potentially purge yourself of some precancerous cells  tim ferriss   precancerous cells, which pretty much everybody has by age 35, 40, right, i would imagine?  dominic d agostino   pretty much, yeah  our immune system is kind of a surveillance mechanism that detects them and takes care of them  in our animal models, the cancer cells are kind of   they ve evolved to evade the immune system, so that s one of the hallmarks of cancer, right, that it can metastasize, evade the immune system  now, in 2011, thy finally added that it has an aberrant metabolic phenotype, but they ignored the whole metabolic thing for a while  but, yes, so our immune system kind of becomes overwhelmed or declines in its capacity with age  so that surveillance, that immune system surveillance over our bodies of these potential neoplastic cells can be overlooked  and i think one way to reset our body and even stimulate our immune system is to do therapeutic fasting   tim ferriss   definitely   dominic d agostino   and i think it can build us up in ways that we re just really starting to understand now   tim ferriss   so i m trying to   or i m not trying  i am fasting at least once per quarter  and the question of duration is one i d love to ask you about because i can go seven days if need be  i ve done that already  last time, i wanted to see what it would be like just from a starvation standpoint, you know, crash in an airplane, going from high carb intake to no food, which i would not do again  i would induce ketosis as quickly as possible nutritionally and  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    then do it because i had excruciating lower back pain  i just was like in a fetal position with   i think my uric acid levels   dominic d agostino   i ve seen that   tim ferriss     were just through the roof, among other things  so i d like to avoid that  that was really shitty  but my question is  if the therapeutic fast is, say, two to three times a year, what duration might those fasts be? what is the sort of minimum effective dose in your colleagues  mind, or i m not sure if it was colleague or student, but    dominic d agostino   yeah  if you want to do it kind of hardcore    tim ferriss   yeah, that s kind of my mo   dominic d agostino     and be resilient, yeah, yeah, okay   and this would apply to someone on a high carbohydrate diet, too  but what i ve seen, i mean, you just described it very nicely there, the back pain  you know, your body goes into kind of more or less a stress    tim ferriss   shitty, shitty sleep, like, horrible    dominic d agostino   yeah   tim ferriss     i guess that s   is that a cholinergic response? i don't know  but every   i was in a location where there were 40 people fasting, 50 people fasting, some of whom had been doing it for two weeks, three weeks, four weeks or so   dominic d agostino   wow   tim ferriss   but everyone reported horrible insomnia and, like, tachycardia, like, rapid heartbeat when they were trying to sleep   dominic d agostino   yeah, so, yeah, that s an activation of your sympathetic nervous system  it s your body saying, hey, this is a stress response, so that s lack of fuel flow to your brain will trigger brain fog  it ll trigger headache  it ll trigger activism of sympathetic immune system  your insulin levels will go down very rapidly, right, and when insulin goes down, it has a natriuretic effect, which means that you lose sodium, so you re peeing out all your sodium, so your  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    blood volume drops  you become hypovolemic, and your blood pressure will drop and that ll contribute to your headache and just feeling crappy and   tim ferriss   dizziness when you stand up and all that, yeah   dominic d agostino     some people faint, yeah  i ve seen several women   it seems to be more pronounced in women that try this, that they faint and i had a couple of them, they called me up, and it made them go crazy  like, they thought they were going to die  so, if you can get past that, if you can get past the feeling of   and that s usually the second and third day  i ve got reports as early as the end of the first day, but i think they were kind of wimps  but usually the second and third day, you re kind of hurting  if you can cruise through that, and i think cruising through it would be a lot easier with exogenous ketones    tim ferriss   i would totally 100 percent agree, yeah   dominic d agostino     so if you re giving your body some kind of cheat through that  so this is something that i m kind of working on, like, developing, thoughtfully developing protocols that would make this whole process easier and even enjoyable potentially  so, okay, in a perfect world if you can tolerate fasting, i would do it ideally, yeah, like, maybe once every quarter for five days  i think five days is sort of the point where you start to level off everything, five to seven days  some of the   that work by george cahill at harvard showed them kind of leveling off at about ten days, but they were severely obese people starting from absolute baseline  so i would say a five to seven day fast, two to three times a day or maybe two to four times   not per day, per year would be    tim ferriss   i was, like, wow, this is a real interstellar moment  you were really doing some funny stuff with time  okay, yeah   dominic d agostino   no, sorry    tim ferriss   no, no   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    dominic d agostino     per year, i think would be something to do  and you d want to, you know, i would kind of say time it so it would fit into your schedule, but when i fasted, i did it right in the middle of writing grants and teaching and all this other stuff  and it didn t   i think it increased my productivity because think about all the time that you spend preparing food, eating food, cleaning up, eliminating, and shopping for food and all these things associated with our fixation on food   tim ferriss   it s a lot   dominic d agostino   and that s kind of time that you save  and i also realized that i was, prior to doing this, and this goes back five, six years ago, i had a preoccupation with food  and even going back maybe a little bit longer, i thought i had to eat, like, five or six meals a day  and i would prepare my food, like, all my food on a sunday and put it in bags, in tupperware and have it in there and have it labeled, and i was kind of neurotic about it  and that s okay if you re into that sort of thing, and i think it s good, and it actually may be more efficient throughout the week, and no offence against people who do that  but i find that not doing that makes me more productive  and i find that eating a ketogenic diet also sustains me   sustains my energy levels to where i just get more out of life  i m more productive  i m not fixated on food because i don t have to eat as frequently but because my energy levels are stable  so i can spend the time doing the things that i think are more productive  and i m in the process as we speak   this is like the week that i submit everything for my tenure, so it s been super crazy as far as 18 hour days preparing for all this and traveling and stuff on top of that  and i can t imagine doing that living the way i used to live, eating five, six meals a day and having it timed and everything  i just couldn t do it  so this makes it easier   tim ferriss   yeah, it is very liberating to realize that you don t have to eat on the clock three times a day and that in fact you ll be fine and in some cases even better   dominic d agostino   yeah   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   i was astonished when i went through my very unpleasant plane crash simulation starvation  i was miserable from   well, miserable s exaggerated  i was fatigued in day 2, and then i had the low back pain and so on day 3 and part of day 4, and then i was fine  but the latter part of day 4, 5, 6 and then before breaking the fast, i felt fantastic  i mean, i went for long walks  i felt extraordinarily cognitively sharp  have you found that you or other people, subjects in ketosis, require less sleep because when i get past a certain millimolar point, for whatever reason   and i love sleep, and i tend to sleep quite a bit, you know, eight to ten hours a night   but i found that i would wake up after six hours, six and a half hours and not have any morning fog and be able to go about my day without fatigue  have you observed that in other people, or is that just a tim thing?  dominic d agostino   yeah, i have  i ve gotten emails about that  i found it in a couple kind of articles on discussing that  and i found that in myself that, like, last night, i got to bed at 2 00 a m  i try to get to bed about, like, midnight, and i woke up at 6 30, 7 00, so i m running on four and a half, maybe five hours, and i feel totally fine  i ve been pretty productive today, did a lot of work in the morning  and i typically run better, best on about six hours, as opposed to maybe seven or eight that i felt i required  and that depends on my activity level and kind of what s going on  but generally, i feel like i need about one or two hours  less sleep, that my requirement for that is less now  and i think there s different reasons for that, and i think when we re in a state of nutritional ketosis, we have better fuel flow to our brain without the fluctuations in glucose throughout the day  and i think that our astrocytes actually kind of spare   our astrocytes have    tim ferriss   what is an astrocyte? i apologize   dominic d agostino   oh, i m sorry  there s different brain cells, like neurons and glial cells, and among the glial would be astrocytes  and it s thought that astrocytes are   they actually store glycogen, a form of carbohydrates, a form of glucose for the  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    neurons  and it s thought that that may be their function and that when we go to sleep, the astrocytes can actually build up their glycogen levels  so there s a couple studies that indicate this  and i think sleep is a restorative process obviously, but i think we restore neurotransmitters, and we restore the bioenergetics of the brain when we sleep, and i think that process is more   is enhanced or is augmented when you re in a state of ketosis or if you ve adapted to living in a state of ketosis  i think our brains are better able to restore homeostasis of our brain chemistry  and i think that metabolic   so enhancing global brain metabolic activity or preserving brain homeostasis or metabolic homeostasis in the brain is a reason why the ketogenic diet is so effective for all these different seizure disorders independent of the etiology  so, whether it s a glucose transporter deficiency or temporal lobe epilepsy   tim ferriss   what does etiology mean?  dominic d agostino   oh, etiology is like independent of the cause of the disease  so, for example, glucose transporter deficiency syndrome is actually there s a defect in the transporter that gets the glucose across the blood brain barrier for the brain to use glucose as an energy source  so, if a child has glucose transporter deficiency, the only therapy that s offered is a ketogenic diet, and it restores fuel flow to the brain so the child can live a normal life, right? so, even in the presence of a persistent molecular pathology, like the glucose transporter deficiency   and we know the cause  we ve identified the gene and the protein product   so even in the presence of that persistent molecular pathology, the ketogenic diet can completely silence the symptoms of that disease  and it s doing that by restoring homeostasis in the brain, not only the energy to the brain, but the neurotransmitter levels are restored  there s a balance of glucose   or of glutamate to gaba, so the gaba levels are restored   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and i think that s what s happening too when it comes to sleep  so we know if we do a cerebral, you know, a csf, the cerebral fluid of the brain in people that are on a ketogenic diet, it shows that there s a higher gaba to glutamate ratio  so glutamate is excitatory, whereas gaba is kind of like inhibitory  it s kind of like the chilling out neurotransmitter  so there s various things out there that you can take, like phenibut or gaba that you can take before bed and helps you sleep  so the ketogenic diet elevates these things naturally, so that may be offering some sleep promoting potential  but i do think that being in a state of ketosis and having ketones elevated and having them available for your brain can enhance your restorative processes that occur when you re sleeping in the brain  tim ferriss   so i am looking to shift gears a little bit  i m looking at some goodies that i m making a cocktail with in front of me  and i ve been fasting since i got up, and it s about 1 30 my time, and i can feel my brain starting to get a little grumpy, even though i m in ketosis  and so i m inspired by our conversation  i have ketosports ketocana calcium and sodium betahydroxybutyrate, and the label says dietary ketone supplement for enhanced physical and mental performance  this one is not for resale, for r d use only, so this must be an early one  and then i have the branched chain amino acids  and then i have a parillo mct oil, captri, which is the caprylic acid  now, on the side of the calcium sodium beta hydroxybutyrate, the ketocana, they have the directions, you know, consume 15 minutes prior to cardio intensive exercise  maybe used with carbohydrate supplements if desired, blah, blah, blah  do not exceed three servings per day  so i want to ask you about the risks or toxicity of consuming exogenous ketones  and part of the reason i m wondering is because i think of consuming these while on a standard american diet or a high carbohydrate diet, and it just seems like a very unnatural combination to me, but i could be totally off  so i d love for you just to talk about the toxicity risks or other risks associated with exogenous ketones   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    dominic d agostino   okay  so it says do not exceed three servings per day, so you will   the gi intolerance will far exceed sort of the biological intolerance that you ll get from  inaudible    tim ferriss   so your body will stop you through diarrhea before you get close to anything that ll hurt you? is that    dominic d agostino   exactly  i mean, that s the same thing with mct, right? you re limited by your ability to transport it across the gut  so the mineral load that you would get from the ketocana product would cause an osmotic issue in the gut  and it s great if you want to stay regular  so it stimulates peristalsis in the gut  so you ll get that side effect probably if you exceed   for me, i could probably do up to five or six servings a day and be okay  but as far as toxicity, and this is where we can draw off some of the rat studies we re doing, we just finished a 15 week study in rats, and it s equivalent to, like, a year or two years in humans where we fed a variety of ketone supplements from esters to the salts to combinations thereof at 25 grams per kilogram per day  so that s really high, right? so we did that   this is part of the toxicology studies that we are doing to get fda approval for different things  so they actually just required 2 5 grams per kilogram per day  well, i was, like, well, let s increase that tenfold, and we formulated it  i come at this from the fda may see this as a drug, but i see ketones as a fourth macronutrient, right? you have fats  you have proteins and carbs  ketones are an energycontaining molecule, and they re like water soluble fat molecules  so we formulated them into the diet, and we fed it   we fed our rodent models this, and we did clinical chemistry  we were doing metabolomics  we do histology  we did actually some anxiety studies where    tim ferriss   what is histology? i m sorry   dominic d agostino   oh, histology is where we, at the end of the study, we harvest all the organs, right, like, the kidneys, the liver and heart and everything, and we weigh them out  and then we take the  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    organs, and then we basically treat them in a way where we can section them and make slices of them and look at the cells  so we can look at the liver, for example, or the kidneys, and then we can examine at the level of the mitochondria inside the cells  we can examine these cells to determine whether the agent that we administered caused any toxicity to the animal, to the organs  tim ferriss   got it   dominic d agostino   and if there was toxicity, we would be able to pick it up most likely in the clinical chemistry, which we ve done that  and we ve also, on top of clinical chemistry and the histology, we also looked at about 27 different types of cytokines  and we didn t see anything relative to the control, relative to the standard rodent chow  there were no abnormalities to indicate liver or kidney stress  and on top of that we did, kind of parallel to this in the same group, we did some    tim ferriss   and that was at 25   what was it, 25 grams per kilogram?  dominic d agostino   25 grams per kilogram, so instead of delivering it like they do in drug studies with one dose, we formulated it into the diet  so we figured out how much   how many grams of food the animal ate, and then we took that and we formulated it in a way that we know that if they ate this amount of grams per food a day, they would be getting this amount  so, instead of getting it at a big dose once a day, they would eat it   they d nibble on it throughout the day   tim ferriss   got it   dominic d agostino   and that s kind of a more realistic way to give it instead of doing like most drug studies, or even food studies are done with food additives  they just give it in a bolus   tim ferriss   so is the   i m sorry   dominic d agostino   and we didn t see anything, no negative effects   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   okay  so you haven t observed any toxicity then, no known toxicity? like, there s no, like, ld50 of   sorry, lethal dose 50, like a dose that ll kill 50 percent of the subjects or anything like that or produce some nasty effect  you guys just haven t observed it?  dominic d agostino   not when administered that way  so, in taking a step back, if we were to give 25 grams per kilogram as a single dose of our most potent ketone ester, that would cause ketoacidosis in the rats for sure   tim ferriss   got it   dominic d agostino   and then that would be hard to reverse actually, but that would be such   i don t even think that volume is possible  i think the iacuc wouldn t even allow us to administer that dose because the volume would be so high for the stomach, you know what i mean? so it would be really, really high  so we haven t seen any side effects at doses that would even approach kind of what s on the label there  and you have to figure, when these things are ingested, it s bioidentical to what our body makes anyway  and even if we eat an egg or a piece of   if we eat muscle from an animal that s in ketosis, we re getting ketones, exogenous ketones  we re just not getting it at the level that would really put us into ketosis, although i think milk, there s some ketones in milk and different products that could kind of boost your ketone levels a little bit  so we sort of looked into that when we were trying to understand for fda regulations, are ketones in our food? and, yes, they are in our food if an animal s in ketosis and we re drinking milk from an animal or meat from an animal that s in ketosis  we re technically consuming exogenous ketones   tim ferriss   so are there any unusual foods or beverages or anything that increase ketone levels dramatically in animals or humans that you ve seen? so i ll give you an example, and this could be a complete   well, it is speculation, but it could be just completely erroneous  so i ve gotten a bunch of my friends kind of hooked on using the precision xtra device to track their millimolar  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    levels  and some of them have really gone kind of nuts where they re taking five to ten readings a day and so on  and one of them observed   this is kevin rose   that artichokes seemed to spike ketone levels  and he replicated it for himself, i think, two or three times  i ve been doing some experimentation with it, but i was, like, huh, interesting because artichoke extract, i ve seen it used as a   what is it?   pde4 inhibitor because pde4 breaks down cyclical amp, as far as i understand, blah, blah, blah  but is there any   i mean, you could talk to artichoke specifically   i don't know if you ve ever looked at it, but are there any foodstuffs or things that people can use to jack up ketone levels besides exogenous ketones or mct oil, etc ? dominic d agostino   yeah, that s an interesting observation with the artichoke  artichokes are mostly fiber really, and i guess that could lead into the next question, right? soluble fiber breaks down into short chain fatty acids, which are ketotic   tim ferriss   oh, interesting   dominic d agostino   so i was actually at nasa a few weeks ago, and it was brought to my attention by a former astronaut, rick linnehan, who s also a vet, that cows are ketotic, and this gets back to sort of the thing we were talking about, about short chain fatty acids being formed from the breakdown of soluble fiber  and short chain fatty acids can be a form of ketones, can contribute to ketogenesis and also the generation of butyrate in the gut, which can enhance and contribute to our gut microbiota  so, yeah, so i think that needs to be appreciated that we were talking about foods that could enhance ketosis  and i think that one could formulate a ketogenic diet with the intention to further enhance ketosis by adding certain types of fiber, soluble fiber that are broken down into short chain fatty acids, which are potentially ketogenic, like your friend that had the artichoke and had a big bump in ketones  that s really interesting  i love artichokes, and maybe that s why i get levels   i m looking at the macronutrient profile of artichokes now, and i see that, yeah, they re primarily carbohydrate but mostly fiber  and that fiber can be ketogenic   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and fiber can also assist in helping us stay in ketosis by being a buffer when they re eaten with protein because it helps slow the digestion, assimilation and utilization of protein  so you get less of a spike in amino acid levels, which can help   a quick spike in amino acid levels can shut off ketogenesis  and if you attenuate that spike, it can help promote your body into staying in that state of ketosis longer by   tim ferriss   i m sorry to interrupt  is the spike knocking you out of ketogenesis because the liver is using gluconeogenesis to convert those amino acids into glucose, or is it something else entirely?  dominic d agostino   yeah, if you get too many amino acids getting into the liver as a source of fuel for gluconeogenesis, but also protein can stimulate a release of insulin, and insulin is very antiketogenic  so it s the combination of attenuating the rise in amino acids, which will attenuate the rise in glucose, which will attenuate the bump in insulin that you could potentially get from that  so fiber is a pretty   fiber is actually really useful   tim ferriss   what would be good sources of fiber that are going to have very low net carbs?  dominic d agostino   yeah, i think the staple ones that i like are   actually, artichoke is on that list   spinach, kale, broccoli, asparagus is probably at the top of my list, celery a little bit, so any kind of green leafy vegetables, like salad  i have a salad every night with mixed greens and a lot of olive oil  and always eat your vegetables with a source of fat  i think it helps promote that you re getting the most nutrition out of the vegetables  and also, if you mix your food so you re eating your protein with   obviously, high fat and fiber will definitely help you stay in ketosis because if you just bolus protein, a lot of people say they re on a ketogenic diet just by eating no carbs, but a chicken breast will quickly kick you out of ketosis  but a chicken breast cut up into a green leafy salad with a lot of olive oil and maybe some feta cheese and some bulletproof coffee or something like that combined will not kick you out of  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    ketosis  you can just stay cruising in ketosis  so this, i think, needs to be appreciated if you re   tim ferriss   just to fill in the blank though, the blanks for your sort of typical day then, if your breakfast is sardines, half a can of oysters, four eggs, and then some asparagus or some other green, what are the rest of your meals for a typical day?  dominic d agostino   okay  i do get a lot of mct in the day, so    tim ferriss   those are just tablespoons of mct oil or the powdered mct oil?  dominic d agostino   i have the powder and the oil sometimes, and i cook in coconut oil  and i ll cook with a combination, coconut oil and butter, so i ll put a pat of butter with a spoonful of butter in a pan and cook my eggs in that  and the sardines, if i have sardines in the morning, it s packed in extra virgin olive oil, which i like a lot of  i was eating a lot of dairy fat, and i noticed my ldl went really high, and my ldl particle number went up  and that s kind of like a whole other conversation, but i was kind of doing an experiment on myself  so i haven t phased out dairy completely, but i ve backed off on it a little bit and been using more coconut cream in place of regular cream  yeah, so in the morning, i kind of described my breakfast already  but at nighttime, what i like to have would be i always have a salad   tim ferriss   so you re skipping breakfast and having intermittent mct oil instead   or i m sorry, you re skipping lunch and having    dominic d agostino   yeah, yeah  and when i have my breakfast, i will make   i ll have a cup of coffee, but i have a thermos that i bring with me to work  and in that thermos i cut a stick of butter in half and throw it in it, and then i put a scoop or two scoops of mct powder, and then i pour the rest of my coffee that i make in a french press in that  and then i just kind of shake it up or zip it up so it s all mixed up, and then i bring that with me to work, and that s the coffee that i sip on throughout the day   tim ferriss   i see   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    dominic d agostino   and basically, i make, like, three cups of coffee  it s not super strong, probably less strong than starbucks coffee or something, but i have, like, one cup in the morning and then two equivalent cups in my thermos  and sometimes i ll brew a cup of coffee at work, or i have a product that my friend makes  it s called utopian  it s a really good product by de novo nutrition  i ll do that instead of coffee, and then i ll    tim ferriss   what is utopian?  dominic d agostino   oh, utopian, oh, there s a company   my friend has a company called de novo nutrition   tim ferriss   how do you spell that?  dominic d agostino   de novo is spelled d e n o v o   tim ferriss   oh, okay, got it   dominic d agostino   like, made de novo, you know  so de novo nutrition makes some really interesting products, and i m really particular about products that i use  and the one product that they have is called utopian, and they also sell probably the highest quality whey protein too  but utopian is a product that i use sparingly  i have it packed in my bag now because i ll be traveling in europe  and it s basically like a cognitive enhancement agent that also promotes sort of a wellbeing, and you might call it   it s a mild nootropic and a mild stimulant  and it s just got some standard things in it, like huperzine  you might be familiar with that   tim ferriss   sure, yeah, the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, right, huperzine?  dominic d agostino   yeah, it has that  it s got, like five ingredients that are formulated really well that enhance acetylcholine transmission, enhance dopamine  there s just enough caffeine to get a stimulant, i think about 100 milligrams of caffeine  and it s just   it s a good product too that i keep on hand  and a lot of thought went into the formulation of it with the ratios of things  so i definitely   if you re looking for a lift, a boost, sort of a nootropic, utopian is definitely something that i keep at the corner of my desk  and i use it kind of sparingly, but i ll use it a couple times a month   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   and then dinner is a large salad? what does the salad composition look like for you?  dominic d agostino   yeah, i usually get, like, mixed greens, two or three different types of salads, usually spinach, a mixed green, and two different types of mixed green bagged salads, and i mix them together  and i get a good quality extra virgin olive oil, and i will   what else do i put in it? artichokes actually, avocado, artichokes, olive oil, and i put mct oil on as salad dressing too  and so i ll make a salad and maybe a little bit of parmesan cheese on it or feta  and we have typically chicken, which would have the skin on it, beef, or fish  and it s usually the fattiest versions that we can get  and i don t go too overboard on the protein like i used to, so pretty moderate amount of protein, maybe about 50 grams of protein and then some kind of    tim ferriss   50, five zero?  dominic d agostino   yeah, like, 50 grams  that would be like my bolus, like, probably one of the larger protein meals  and if i work out, if i happen to work out, which i did yesterday, i would probably eat a little bit more, maybe about 60 or 70 or 80 grams of protein  and that ll be kind of my larger meal of the day  and then i ll have a salad, some kind of fatty protein, and last night i cooked brussels sprouts, and i kind of cut them in half facedown and cooked them in butter and olive oil   no, butter and coconut oil, so they suck it up  and so i think of vegetables as like a fat delivery system, so the same thing with collard greens or asparagus  they re usually cooked in a lot of butter, olive oil, coconut oil, and i ll have that  so i ll have some kind of fatty protein, some kind of vegetable cooked in fat, and salad   tim ferriss   got it   dominic d agostino   and then i always have dessert that s kind of unique actually  i call it my   i don't know   keto mousse or keto ice cream  and what it essentially is, is it could be sour cream or coconut cream, and i take sour cream   so the easiest thing, take sour  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    cream or coconut cream and take maybe about a cup of it or two cups, cup and a half, and then i put a tablespoon of dark chocolate baking powder in it, some cinnamon, a pinch of salt, and stevia and stir it up until it s like a thick mousse, and then i stick it in the freezer  then i go kind of do my things, shower, get ready for the day or whatever  then i take it out of the freezer or refrigerator, and it s basically like ice cream to me  tim ferriss   that sounds amazing  so it s one cup sour cream, one tablespoon dark chocolate powder   hope that s right    dominic d agostino   yeah   tim ferriss     pinch of salt  how much stevia?  dominic d agostino   stevia, just sweeten it to whatever you like  i mean, i have the super concentrated stevia, so i just put literally a pinch of it in there   tim ferriss   what brand do you use? do you know offhand?  dominic d agostino   i have to go back and look at the brand, but you can get it on amazon if you just go to bulk stevia powder, and it comes in, like, a two pound or a one pound container   tim ferriss   got it   dominic d agostino   and, yeah, it s kind of like the generic   i ve tried every brand of stevia, and this is   it s powder  it s pretty good  it travels well and everything too   tim ferriss   and cinnamon  cool  that s nice   dominic d agostino   yeah, a little bit of cinnamon  and it s like a fat bomb  so people ask, like, where do you get all your fat? you know, this is a lot of fat to eat to get in about 300 grams of fat a day for the diet  so, yeah, so that s like a fat bomb  it s about 80 grams of fat, i think  and you know what? if i eat that at nighttime, and if i work out or if i haven t gotten any carbohydrates during the day, i usually put in, like, a third of a cup or even a half cup of wild  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    blueberries, which are higher in fiber, not real sweet but higher in fiber, and i stir that into it  and sometimes i ll do   it ll be a pretty big bowl   i ll do, like, two cups of coconut cream or two cups of sour cream  so i was doing a lot of   i have a whipped cream maker that i put heavy cream in, and i would put whipped cream on top of that  and in my whipped cream maker, i would put the heavy cream, and then i d put stevia in, so i d sweeten the whipped cream a little bit, shake it up and charge it with the little things that they have and make my own whipped cream  and i would put whipped cream on top of that  so it s like a 100 gram fat bomb  tim ferriss   wow   dominic d agostino   and i was getting in extra fat throughout the day with heavy cream, and i did an experiment because i wanted to determine what happens if you have surplus amount of calories in the form of dairy fat, and if i did that for two weeks? so i got, like, 1,000 extra calories per day, 500 to 1,000 extra calories per day for two weeks  then i went in and got an nmr lipidomic profile of everything  and it really shot up some things remarkably, like my ldl p particle, and i m still analyzing it right now  i m kind of still doing experiments on myself  but i went back, and i cut out the dairy and i replaced it with coconut cream  and all those numbers came back down  but i still get dairy in the form of butter, and i just don t go too overboard with it    tim ferriss   got it   dominic d agostino     because people ask me that question a lot, like, can i have dairy? and i do have dairy every day, but i ve switched out my nighttime snack, switched out the sour cream to either a mix of sour cream and coconut cream together   and sour cream s really not sour, right? i mean, especially if you have   i buy the dark chocolate baking cocoa, the extra dark, and it s a little bit bitter, and if you add it to it, it sort of neutralizes any remote little sourness  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    that sour cream has  and it makes a really delicious chocolate mousse  tim ferriss   i ll have to try that   dominic d agostino   and it s, like, purely ketogenic  and, oh, yeah, i also will take a tablespoon of coconut oil, and especially if it has the frozen blueberries in it, and then if i drizzle it around and stir it up, the coconut oil will sort of harden and make these little crunchy chocolate things  so it actually tastes like you have chocolate chips in there if that makes sense  you know how coconut oil    tim ferriss   yeah   dominic d agostino   yeah, and then my fianc e s totally not ketogenic  i mean, she has an enormous carbohydrate tolerance, and she just thinks what i do is really strange  but if i make this   and she s a big fan of regular breyers or haagen dazs chocolate   and if i give this to her, she thinks it s incredible  so even someone who s not ketogenic and doesn t eat this way and has a sweet tooth thinks this is really good   tim ferriss   cool  i ll try it out  so i would love to ask some rapid fire questions  i know we re wrapping up  we could talk for many more hours  but for people who want to dig into ketosis further, give it a shot, what resources should they start with or books should they start with?  dominic d agostino   yeah, i think probably the best place to go would be ketogenic diet resource, and that s a website  ellen davis has that website, and literally that s the name of it, ketogenicdietresource com  and it s like a ton of information on there, pretty much every question you d ever want on there  we even   she put together a book for ketogenic diet and cancer, one for the ketogenic diet for type 2 diabetes  it was coauthored by a doctor that s actually in my area that has type 1 diabetes that uses the ketogenic diet for that  so that s an incredible resource   tim ferriss   excellent, ellen davis   dominic d agostino   yeah, ellen davis, ketogenic diet resource, definitely one of the go to places   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    i have a website, ketonutrition org, and basically it s like a skeleton website  i just compiled a lot of useful links that i thought   and her website s on there  her book s on there  so that s ketonutrition org  tim ferriss   awesome  what is the book you ve given most as a gift, not necessarily related to ketosis, just any book that you ve given often or given before as a gift?  dominic d agostino   that s a good question  yeah, i would have to   well, going back in the college days, i would say anthony robbins, i listened to his stuff when i was   my senior year in high school, and i listened to these 30 day tapes back when we listened to tapes   tim ferriss   oh, the personal power?  dominic d agostino   yeah, personal power  so i bought the book too  and i liked it so much, i bought it and i gave it to all my lifting buddies  and they went off to college and everything, and years later, two of them contacted me and they re, like, you know that book you gave me? it changed my life  i did better in college and everything  so i would say, going way back, personal power, anthony robbins  book, was kind of influential from back in the day  and then, as i got into science and became a scientist, and my advisor was funded by the nih, and i was always told that i needed nih funding to be a career scientist  and then i met the nih director, francis collins, at a society for neuroscience meeting  and i was, like, well, i should understand the mind of francis collins and understand, what is the director of   basically the president of science thinking? so i went to try to find some biographies on him, and when i did a search i found a book, the language of god, and i thought that was really   i had no idea of his sort of   his spirituality or his kind of worldview, besides   outside of science  i knew he spearheaded the human genome project and was pretty instrumental in finding the gene for cystic fibrosis  but so the language of god, it really inspired me because i had no idea that a scientist of his stature could have such a devout faith  and that kind of influenced me and got me to  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    reread some older books i read by c s  lewis, the screwtape letters  tim ferriss   screwtape letters is great   dominic d agostino   yeah, yeah, the screwtape letters is really good  and i don t think i ve given that, but i gave the language of god to some of my friends, and they really enjoyed it, so that would be one  and then a required reading for my students would be tom seyfried s book, cancer as a metabolic disease  so that s a really   i mean, i think it sold pretty well on amazon, and it s highly, highly technical, and unfortunately it s really expensive, so it s about 100 to 130 bucks, i think   tim ferriss   wow   dominic d agostino   maybe you can get it cheaper  you can get used versions for probably, like, 50 bucks online  but if you want a really good kind of description of, i guess, cancer as a metabolic disease, the science, the history, i mean, it s really well written  tom did   he s a collaborator of mine  he worked a lot on that book, and it shows, so that book  and, oh, another book by a guy that i m actually working on a project with him now, his name is travis christofferson  he wrote a book called tripping over the truth   tim ferriss   quite the name, yeah   dominic d agostino   yeah  and he wrote a precursor to the book  he wrote an article that appeared on robb wolf s blog, and i m actually   i have an article written with him that s going to appear on the blog on thursday  it s about the history of the ketogenic diet, and i think robb s going to put it on the blog on thursday, i believe  but travis is a brilliant   he s probably one of the most gifted writers i ve ever known  so tripping over the truth is basically the story of cancer really  i mean, it s a great history of the story of cancer that comes at it from a different perspective from the mukherjee book, the biography of cancer that is pretty popular, new york times bestseller, it s been on   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    the emperor of all maladies is actually the name of the book, the biography of cancer  that book kind of talks about the history of cancer  tripping over the truth is similar to mukherjee s book, but viewed from the perspective of understanding cancer as more or less a metabolic disease and how we could develop therapies to target it from a metabolic perspective  and i ve given that book, probably bought seven or eight copies of that book over the last year and given it away  and everybody has come back to me and said that book was fantastic  i mean, not only is it informative, but travis is an unbelievable gifted writer  tim ferriss   awesome  let me ask you one   i have one more question, and then maybe we ll do a round 2 if people demand it by popular request   dominic d agostino   sure   tim ferriss   but you mentioned robb, so robb and i are friends, robb wolf, and we ve talked about lyme disease on and off for a while now because i was out of commission for about nine months or at least operating at about 10 percent capacity after contracting lyme disease on eastern long island  and what appears to have made the biggest difference for me, in terms of getting back to feeling like myself and having the cognitive function that i had pre lyme disease was the ketogenic diet  and i was very puzzled by this, and i wasn t sure exactly why that would be the case  and so i just hypothesized that perhaps either lyme disease or the subsequent antibiotic treatment caused some type of carbohydrate metabolism dysfunction  and i was chatting with robb about this because i didn t know the mechanism, but i had recommended to a few people with lyme that they test ketosis  and literally 100 percent of them, if they entered ketosis properly and stayed there for more than a week or two, reported the same results  and robb sent me an interesting research abstract which showed how antibiotics such as doxycycline could cause  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    mitochondrial dysfunction or degradation because my understanding is that mitochondria are very similar to bacteria  and how would you explain ketosis making me and these other people feel better after lyme disease? and i don't know if you re familiar with lyme disease   dominic d agostino   yeah, yeah   tim ferriss     but how would you approach thinking about that and investigating that?  dominic d agostino   well, i m from new jersey    tim ferriss   yeah, you re in lyme country   dominic d agostino     so lyme disease is really, you know, i knew a lot of people, especially growing up in a family that was hunters and knowing most of my friends were hunting and in the woods  i grew up in the woods  somehow i didn t get lyme disease, never been tested for it but never really had any symptoms for it  so lyme disease really produces pretty profound inflammation  and the spirochetes can cause everything that you described, fatigue  but i think they can cause, you know, from a neurological perspective, they can cause encephalopathy, and that essentially is resulting from neuroinflammation  and ketones, the ketogenic diet and ketones in particular have pretty profound anti inflammatory effects and especially in relation to the nervous system, since ketones are freely permeable to the blood brain barrier and kind of bathe our nervous system  so i think that may have something to do with it  also, the spikes in blood glucose, higher insulin levels all can contribute to inflammation and inflammatory processes  so putting a dampening on that situation with a ketogenic diet and having elevated levels of ketones could impact the primary malady that s causing the symptoms, which would be the inflammation, the encephalopathy, the inflammation of the white matter, i think   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    there s memory attention  cognitive, emotional states are altered in people, and i think it can just help bring your nervous system back to a state of homeostasis, similar to what it s doing for other disorders  but inflammation is really   did you happen to get bloodwork and look at   because the spirochete really   that s how it wreaks havoc in your system, i mean, by activating your immune system, but also just wreaking havoc, as far as causing systemic inflammation in the body  tim ferriss   yeah, i could go back  you mean looking at things like c reactive protein or whatever?  dominic d agostino   yeah, or cytokines or something like that   tim ferriss   yeah, cytokines  i m sure i have the bloodwork  i mean, the inflammation was so clear to me that i didn t really need the bloodwork to confirm it  i mean, my knees were so swollen that i could barely get up in the morning, and i had very slow, almost slurred speech and felt like i had early onset dementia  it was really scary as an experience  what effect does ketosis have on mitochondria, if any?  dominic d agostino   yeah  so ketones are very efficient metabolic fuel, and in studies that were done in animal models   and we re looking at the muscle biopsies too   shows that if you re in a state of ketosis relative to a higher carbohydrate diet that it can increase the mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial efficiency  at the level of the cell, when we talk about efficiency, i don t want to get down into too much specifics, but the electron transport chain is kind of how our cells, the mitochondria make energy  and there s a site between complex 1 and complex 2 and complex 3 called the semi  ubiquinone site, and ketones have the ability to oxidize q basically, and that can prevent by   ketone metabolism can enhance the energetic flux through the mitochondria to produce ntp or energy currency  and at the same time that it s enhancing the bioenergetics of the mitochondria, it s also preventing the formation of  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    superoxide anion, which is an oxygen free radical or reactive oxygen species  and that s the precursor to more reactive oxygen species like hydroxyl radical and peroxynitrite and things like that  so by kind of fundamentally turning down the generation of superoxide anion by enhancing mitochondrial efficiency, not only do we make more atp through ketone metabolism, but we re also enhancing the flux of substrate utilization and energy production from that substrate, even glucose substrate, by enhancing mitochondrial bioenergetics  and the ketones, we know can do that through a variety of mechanisms that i can get into  but basically, yeah, i mean, you can derive more energy per oxygen molecule   tim ferriss   got it   dominic d agostino     with ketone metabolism   tim ferriss   is it conceivable that ketosis could aid   it sounded like the answer is yes  you mentioned biogenesis  if one had damaged their mitochondria through 8 to 12 weeks of doxycycline or even using harder antibiotics for longer periods of time, is it conceivable that the ketosis could help repair that damage?  dominic d agostino   yeah, yeah, i think so, especially in certain tissues  we know muscle is incredibly plastic, but if you re exercising and in a state of ketosis, that you can build up your mitochondria, and you ll do that more efficiently if you re on a ketogenic diet  and i think even in the central nervous system, which may have taken a big hit from doxycycline or lyme disease, the central nervous system is running more efficiently in a state of ketosis, i believe, especially if you can dampen some of the neuroinflammation that s associated with the disease  and i think that would ultimately contribute to   i don't know how you would quantify that  i m trying to think of studies that we ve done sort of in parallel  we did some work in an alzheimer s model, and i think that the lyme s has been associated with tau and amyloid plaques and neuroinflammation that can contribute to those plaques  and i think being in a state of ketosis   even there s some work with exogenous ketones and calorie restriction or even  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    intermittent fasting type things   can limit the accumulation of some of these plaques that are associated with neuropathology such as alzheimer s disease, the amyloid and the tau plaques  and this can be shown in animal models that are genetically kind of predisposed to accumulating those plaques  and i think that would be   you could probably draw some parallels from that work with the neuroinflammation and the neurotoxic effects that lyme disease kind of has  and lyme disease is not something that i study, but i just come across it a lot because hyperbaric oxygen has been used to sensitize sort of the bacteria to the antibiotics  so a lot of people ask me questions, and i have to go   i ve been staying up on top of the literature kind of in a peripheral sense because it s not my kind of core of study  but everything that i read really focuses on the neuroinflammation that s resulting from the spirochetes  tim ferriss   got it  well, dom, this is so much fun  there are so many other things that we could talk about, the hyperbaric oxygen treatment, the brilliant patrick arnold, we didn t have a chance to get into   dominic d agostino   yeah   tim ferriss   and, i mean, not to mention your own training and the approach that you no doubt bring to that  so i want to let you get going, and if fans enjoy this, then maybe we can do a part 2 sometime   dominic d agostino   okay   tim ferriss   but what is the best way for people to find you online in terms of websites, social media, if they want to say hi to you online  what s the best way to do that?  dominic d agostino   okay  i think probably the best way would be the ketonutrition website, dot org  and i have that and, yeah, facebook, and i probably use that more than twitter   tim ferriss   what are you on facebook?  dominic d agostino   my facebook handle, you mean?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   yeah, your facebook handle  i could pull that up too  i can put that in the show notes if you don t recall it offhand   dominic d agostino   yeah, it should be obvious, right, but    tim ferriss   i think it s   oh, wait, here it is   dominic d agostino   yeah, it s dominic dagostino 1   tim ferriss   got it, all right   dominic d agostino   yeah   tim ferriss   so i will link to the skies, so facebook is facebook com dominic dagostino 1  and i will link to all of this as well as your usf page in the show notes, so everyone listening can find links to many of the things that we talked about in this episode and more at fourhourworkweek com podcast all spelled out or just go to fourhourworkweek com and click on podcast  but, dom, i really appreciate the time  i always love chatting  and how much do you weigh these days?  dominic d agostino   weigh? man, i haven t weighed myself in a while, but about   i always say between 220 and 230, probably about 222, yeah   tim ferriss   is that ever a challenge? i found when i   like, for every additional millimeter of neck diameter that i have, the perceived iq that people have of me drops by five points  do you ever have trouble being taken seriously by people who are not sort of a nerd wrapped in a meathead body?  dominic d agostino   i don t have that problem too much now, just because i have my diet under control  but, yeah, i think sometimes i face that resistance a little bit  but generally, it was a little bit more apparent when i was a younger scientist, but now that i m working my way up and have a lab, i think people are starting to take some of this stuff seriously  i am in a totally oddball area of research though, as far as being in a pharmacology department doing this weird high fat diet stuff  it raises some eyebrows  so i feel like i kind of have to prove myself still   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   well, i think i would like to collaborate more in the future  we ll talk more about that   dominic d agostino   okay   tim ferriss   but this is enough for one big session  so, dom, i really appreciate you taking the time, so thank you   dominic d agostino   thanks for having me, tim   tim ferriss   of course   dominic d agostino    inaudible    tim ferriss   this is a good time  and to everyone listening, as always, thank you for listening, and until next time, experiment, be well  check out the ketogenic diet   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    "
164,172,Dom D’Agostino — The Power of the Ketogenic Diet (#172),"'he s also deadlifted 500 pounds for ten reps after a seven day fast and i consider him a friend  i call him   he s on speed dial for me   with many of my metabolic and nutritional questions  after the last two to two and a half hour conversation with dom   and if you haven t heard that, you can go to fourhourworkweek com dom, d o m and it will take you to that url  after that episode, he and i were just deluged with enthusiastic follow up questions about ketosis, ketones, cancer, etc ''the following is dom answering your most popular questions with a particular focus on ketones, ketosis, ketogenic diet, etc  and for that reason, you could consider it the ketosis master class, especially if you combine both episodes  but this one stands alone if you want to listen to it  there are a couple of things not mentioned necessarily at length or in details  for instance the types of canned sardines and oysters that he eats, king oscar and wild planet foods  this is from the first episode and the show notes is where you can find these sardines ''it s also why whole foods around the country sold out of wild planet foods sardines, this episode  and the canned oysters would be crown prince natural oysters ''you can find all of that in the show notes at fourhourworkweek com dom for the first episode  and we cover a lot  what i would suggest is dom did this on the road  it takes him a few minutes to get warmed up  be patient, listen to it and if you want to skip around, there are a few things, for instance, around eight minutes 55 seconds   let s just call it nine minutes   after this intro ends  can you gain muscle on the ketogenic diet, and related questions around 52 and 20 seconds after this intro, how does he handle travel  what does he pack ''and if you re really considering exploring ketosis or just consuming exogenous ketones, like the ketocana and ketoforce that i ve discussed with dom and also with patrick arnold, a very famous biochemist, for performance enhancing compounds, shall we say, then this is also relevant ''there is data that you can slow, for instance, tumor growth by consuming these synthetic, exogenous ketones even if you are still consuming glucose or producing glucose, which is very, very exciting for all sorts of reasons  in any case, this is going to be dense  it s going to be worth it and just be patient  if you have an interest in these types of metabolic therapies, whether it is for performance enhancement and, let s say, endurance or for anti cancer purposes or otherwise, you will find a gem within this conversation, which is more of a monologue, i suppose ''so please enjoy this conversation with don d agostino  if you want to say hello to him, you can certainly do so on twitter  it s imagine   d o m i n i c d agostino, d a g o s t i and then the number 2  i guess dominic d agostino was taken  so  is his twitter and that will also be in the show notes  you can find all show notes at fourhourworkweek com podcast and what a fucking long intro  i m sorry, folks  enjoy ''dominic d agostino  first question, this will be under the ketogenic diet  under that category are also some questions on fasting, i think  alex david writes ''despite all the evidence, it seems that many dieticians and researchers   i d add clinicians to that   still frown heavily on ketosis  why is there so much resistance? ''i think the main reason would be the lack of education in the medical community, and even in the dietetics programs  so having gone through a nutrition science program in my undergrad 20 or so years ago, there was a little bit of discussion on low carb diets, very little if any on a ketogenic diet ''there was a discussion, kind of a negative discussion, one day i remember on the atkins diet  my professor at the time really sort of despised that diet  that s the problem  registered dieticians who are supposed to be at the cusp, the front of understanding nutrition and how to manipulate nutrition for optimum health or weight loss, as most of the patients they deal with are really trying to lose weight or manage type ii diabetes  and we know the ketogenic diet is a big hammer for type ii diabetes  as jeff follack would say, it can put a type ii diabetic into remission within two weeks or so  we could see that  that s known ''i think the big stigma coming from the dietetic community is that it s just not feasible for people to follow  if you lower the carbs, what type of macro nutrient are you adding? you re adding fat ''saturated fat certainly was demonized back when i was in college over 20 years ago  that s going to be hard to change  i think our stance on that has softened up considerably but it s going to take some time to change the minds of the people who are the major influencers, which would be the medical community and dietetic programs  they need to accept that the low carb ketogenic diet really has a place and right now, it really doesn t have a place  it s getting more attention, which is good, but it doesn t have a place ''and the medical community, too, so the lack of education there  i teach in the medical college and i was on the medical curriculum committee for medical school for three years ''the curriculum is already so compressed and it tries to fit in as much as possible  the information is sort of biased, if you want to say that, towards covering what s on the boards that the medical students have to take, the usmle  so there s just no room to fit nutrition into the medical curriculum, so doctors are not going to have an appreciation of nutrition  they re certainly not going to have an appreciation for the ketogenic diet ''the medical school that i teach at, though, does have a functional medicine group of kids that are very enthusiastic and really smart  they really want this information and they have a lunch seminar series where they have people come in and talk  i ve given a talk, and my students and research associates have given a talk in this ''the feedback has been really good  they want the information but it s just not taught in the general curriculum, and it needs to be  nutrition really is the foundation of our health  and if medicine wants to focus on prevention, there s no better tool than nutrition exercise helps but probably not as much as nutrition  so nutrition research, too, there s just a lack of good research on low carb diets and ketogenic diets  there is some out there if you look, but the rigorous, controlled, multi university trials looking at the effects of a high carb diet versus mediterranean, versus low carb, versus ketogenic diet  these are really difficult studies to do and they re really expensive ''you have the question of who s going to fund these studies, what kind of institutional support do you have to run these studies, are the people at the institute knowledgeable? do they have a team of dieticians that can control the parameters that are need to ensure diet compliance? for example, are they measuring blood ketones for all the participants in the ketogenic diet group? that rarely happens, and that s the kind of oversight that needs to happen to do this kind of research  the research is really going to be important because that s what the medical community, not thought nutrition, that s what they re going to look at  they re going to want evidence ''if you tell them this is a powerful metabolic therapy, and even the standard of care for drug resistant or drug refractory epilepsy, it works remarkably well for that application  and i think it can work equally well for a number of other applications  they re going to want the research to support that  that research is in progress, and i think the low hanging fruit would be looking at type ii diabetes and obesity, and i think that s going to be one of the most important applications for a ketogenic   or maybe not even ketogenic but low carb diet ''a low carb diet is relatively easy to do but nutritional ketosis is really considered extreme and difficult to implement  the question is why are researchers and dieticians frowning on this?''a dietician is going to have a difficult job getting their patients to comply with this kind of diet  i can just tell you people come to me and many of them who attempt the ketogenic diet just can t follow it  it s really hard to follow  that s why i think something like a modified atkins diet  you ll get four times the compliance  if you can get maybe 10 percent of people that can follow a ketogenic diet, i would say if you screen them properly, you can get at least 40 percent of the people to adhere to a modified ketogenic diet, defined as following in a way that they consistently have an elevation of blood ketones, day in and day out  so it s just a much easier diet to follow and i ll talk a little bit more about that later with questions  there s also some resistance from the exercise community, too ''the question is what are you using the ketogenic diet for, and at least on social media there s a lot of talk and discussion and debate about the ketogenic diet for endurance athletes, long distance runners and i think it definitely has an application there  the bigger question that i get a lot is, is it the ideal diet or can you gain muscle size and strength doing resistance training  doing bodybuilding power lifting with the ketogenic diet? i know you can  the question is is it optimal?''probably not for everybody  but i think it can be for a sub population of people  as we age, our carbohydrate tolerance decreases with age ''so the over 40 crowd, and i would fit into that, responds remarkably well to a ketogenic diet in the context of resistance training or low carb diet  but we really need more research on that so hopefully, we plan to do that ''the next question   i probably spent too long on that so i ll probably hit these more rapid fire  the next question comes from grad gross ''could you please ask him about protein intake on ketosis? ''so it seems like there are thousands of different answers out there to this question and yes, everybody s got an answer to how much protein you should take on a ketogenic diet  in the case of me, and in the context of treating kids with epilepsy, it s been found that keeping your protein between 1 and 1 5 grams per kilogram per day is really unique ''they kind of stay within that range to consistently stay in nutritional ketosis  as protein can be insulinogenic, so excess protein can feed into a gluconeogenic pathway and kick you out of ketosis or decrease your ketone levels  so i would say the higher protein, though, is probably needed in people who are more active and also in heavy training  i think when you get the person who is an ectomorph and is super fast metabolism, and maybe on top of that, a friend of mine is an ectomorph, and he has a very high output because he works outside all day  he needs 2 grams per kilogram per day  that s typically far above what most people would take for a ketogenic diet ''but his ketones stay remarkably high off that because his output is really high  a typical ketogenic diet, quote unquote the classic ketogenic diet, a 4 to 1 ratio  four parts fat, one part combination protein carbs has ten percent calories coming from protein  that s really low  so a modified ketogenic diet is 25 to 30 percent calories from percentage protein  that s also called the modified atkins diet ''it really evolved out of work done at johns hopkins  eric kossoff is probably the leader in advancing the modified atkins as a metabolic therapy for kids and adults with seizures  that s really the diet that a lot of athletes are using, myself included ''most people who say they are on a ketogenic diet are not doing the classical ketogenic diet, which is 10 percent protein  so yes, the protein intake, the very general recommendation is 1 to 1 5 grams per kilogram ''matt nelson asks ''the impact on the ketogenic diet on type i diabetes? ''so it s an interesting situation that i have a type i diabetic student in my lab  he s a phd student, remarkable student, big guy  six four, 250 pounds  andrew kutnik is his name and joined the lab with an intense interest in this subject  he took it upon himself to try the ketogenic diet as a type i diabetic  he tracks everything, including his blood glucose, continuously because he has one of the sort of dex con units that continuously measures his blood glucose levels ''he s a remarkable subject for testing ketogenic food products because we could just turn his insulin off  he has a glucose monitoring system and an insulin pump  if we want to examine the glycemic index, or the glycemic response, of different foods, we can use andrew and turn off his insulin pump and then look at his glycemic response to the food  so it comes in very handy ''andrew is a great sport and he decided to try the ketogenic diet and has written up some notes here of things describing his response to the diet ''andrew is very perceptive about many different things, including his insulin sensitivity  so he has a really good handle on how changes in his body composition, his exercise, so when he does brutal exercise training in the gym, the frequency, the consistency, how that affects his blood glucose  the type of insulin that he uses and how that influences his caffeine use, his fiber, the composition of his meal, the types of foods, what he adds to his foods   things like cinnamon ''so he s tracked all these different variables and how these variables influence his blood glucose and the amount of insulin that he needs  when he got around to the ketogenic diet, he realized there were some really big perks to being a type i diabetic and being on a ketogenic diet ''the biggest would be the lack of blood glucose fluctuations  so tremendous difference between glucose fluctuations on a high carb diet versus a ketogenic diet  the daily fluctuations were remarkably tighter  he s been conversing with other type ii diabetics who have switched from the diet that they have been prescribed and the ketogenic diet and it s amazing, the control of blood glucose that you have when you re on a ketogenic diet ''not only is his blood glucose remarkably controlled when he switched to a ketogenic diet, but he was able to reduce his insulin levels to about one third the amount of insulin that he was using before ''so whenever you can reduce the amount of insulin, at type i diabetic can do that, that s a good thing  doctors need to acknowledge that  he had a similar reduction in 24 hour insulin levels  in his notes, he noted that there was a similar reduction in 24 hour insulin levels reported in individuals who were underweight, who underwent a ketogenic diet but maintained body weight  he lists a number of different publications to support the same observation that he saw when he switched from a high carb diet to a ketogenic diet for managing his type i diabetes  his insulin sensitivity increased tremendously ''this has major implications and potential protection against hypoglycemia  in my talks, i always talk about the work of george cahill  in 1967 he published an observation of fasted subjects who, when adapted to a starvation ketosis, were remarkably resilient against insulin induced hypoglycemia  so they suppressed their blood glucose levels with iv infused insulin down to something between 1 to 2 millimolar  that would be universally, if not fatal, would put someone into a coma or a seizure  we know that having blood ketones elevated makes you remarkably protected against hypoglycemia ''so that has real, practical consequences from a safety standpoint  if you re driving, do you know how many accidents are a result from hypoglycemia in people who are diabetic? much of that could probably be mitigated if they were on a ketogenic diet ''he described many benefits in our daily talks in the lab and these benefits eliminate the potential downside of type i diabetes in the short term and the long term  so short term, you re talking acute hypoglycemia, mitigating that is really important  but also the long term  if you re on a high carbohydrate diet and you have huge postprandial excursions in your blood glucose, and you do that repeatedly, that s going to cause a lot of harm in the long term ''that can be completely eliminated or significantly attenuated in type i diabetics, using a low carb approach or a ketogenic diet approach  i know this is a controversial subject and i don t want to base my comments or suggestions off the people that communicate to me  but i have seen first hand what it did to andrew, who not only has much better control over his type i diabetes but has an incredible amount of muscle and strength and continues to surpass a lot of his lifts in the gym while following a ketogenic diet or a low carb approach  so he more or less transitioned from a ketogenic diet to low carb and kind of bounces back and forth ''he doesn t stay ketogenic all the time now but he has told me that he feels best while he is on a ketogenic diet  and certainly he uses much less insulin  so there are some resources out there to point people to, because i do get at least one or two questions a week on this  i would point people to the ketogenic diet for type i diabetes e book, and that s on ketogenicdietresource com  the authors of that book are ellen davis and dr  keith runyan  i know dr  runyan has been on several podcasts talking about his use  he is a type i diabetic  he s a medical doctor with type i diabetes ''next question i want to address is from ohemba narkwoff, who asks the question ''betogenic breath analyzer versus blood  which one s best?''the blood glucose ketone meter by abbott labs, the precision extra and one that i use personally is the freestyle neo is really the gold standard  if you re getting into this and you re not on a type budget, i would recommend measuring every day if you re really serious, and to do it at the same time of day every day  i think that s really important ''the breath acetone meter, that would be the ketonics meter, is really useful and it just really needs more development and testing, from my perspective  we know from at least one, maybe two studies, breath acetone measures correlate with seizure control ''i think if you have kids that are managing a disorder and they don t want their fingers pricked, i think these breath acetone meters are great for kids  i ve talked to parents and kids that enjoy doing them  you blow in and you have these pretty colors  you get the blue with low ketones, or green, and then orange and yellow and red  so they re very convenient for giving you a range of breath acetone that can correlate with seizure control  i think more work needs to be done with them  they re non evasive  what i m interested in is actually using these devices to look at other volatile organic compounds that may be important health biomarkers  for example, it gives you information on oxidative stress ''so you have things like isoprostanes, things that could detect from what i m interested in, just like oxygen toxicity  pulmonary oxygen toxicity will kind of be characterized by blowing off certain volatile organic compounds  and the gut microbiome will influence the volatile organic compounds that are coming out of our mouths  i think these things can be picked up  and once we understand them, we can develop devices to measure these things in our breath  no one has done it yet, and i don t know why it s not possible but saliva ketone measurements, i think that might be something to look into  so if anyone out there is listening, maybe a saliva ketone measurement system could be useful ''the next question is from jeff henderson  he writes ''i d be really curious about how ketosis affects performance at altitude  i live in big sky, montana and do a lot of back country ski touring, climbing, and mountaineering  i ve noticed a significant performance increase while in ketosis  i m currently trying to get enough friends willing to do a ketogenic diet so i can put together an actual experiment with a decent sized data set and would love to hear dom s thoughts on this ''i don t know what he would measure if he did that  there s an increase in brain blood flow when you are in a state of nutritional ketosis  that may reverse some of the things that we know happen as a response to altitude  some individuals can have hypocapnia cerebral basal constriction ''that could maybe be reversed or mitigated in part with nutritional ketosis  there are also things like at altitude, you can have an increased intracranial pressure  the diet actually has a well described diuretic effect  it s fairly mild but it can maybe reduce some of that intracranial pressure that people at really high altitudes can experience ''we know, too, that for energy production, our bodies in general can probably generate energy more efficiently with ketones than it can with other types of fuels  with glucose in particular  and that we probably can derive more energy per oxygen molecule  i would probably direct you to some of the work that was done by richard veech s lab ''they did work with a working profused heart preparation  they looked at the delta g of atp hydrolysis, and they look at the hydraulic efficiency of the heart which increased significantly when the preparation was profused with ketones relative to glucose  there s also a book written by andrew murray and hugh montgomery  that book, how wasting is saving  weight loss at altitude might result from an evolutionary adaptation ''this book kind of describes how nutritional ketosis may mitigate some of the weight loss that s associated with being at altitude  peter thiel also gave a talk, if i remember correct, at ihmc  if you google peter thiel ihmc lecture, he gave a discussion on the performance enhancement effects that he had with the ketogenic diet ''he also describes cycling at high altitude  i think the balance of the data, from a scientific perspective and from feedback that i get, would suggest that being in a state of ketosis can enhance exercise performance at altitude  another person i ve been communicating with recently is patrick sweeney  he actually recently teamed up with professional mountain biker rebecca rush, i think is her name  they did a climb and a descend on mount kilimanjaro on their mountain bikes ''so this was a mountain bike climb  the mission was totally self supported, meaning that they didn t have any porters to carry their bags or anything  they abstained from using acetazolamide, which is diamox, the medication that you take for altitude, and they didn t get altitude sickness ''their goal, patrick sweeney and rebecca rush, the goal of the expedition was to raise  1 00 for every foot of climbing they did  that amounted to a little over  19,000 for an organization called world bicycle relief  patrick had communicated with me prior to attempting this mount kilimanjaro bike ride and i kind of coached him a little bit, and just talked about the ketogenic diet and how you do it  i sent a number of emails  just google patrick sweeney bike ride and it should bring you probably to this event and gives you more information on it ''the next question is from lindsey watkins  lindsey asks ''i d like to hear about any differences or considerations females need to have with the ketogenic diet?''what i ve observed and this may apply to our rodent models, the transition into ketosis can be more difficult for females in general, it seems  they re more variable in their responses, reactive, i would say, to low blood glucose levels, especially initially  i would recommend that females trying this sort of ease into it before just going all out ketogenic  so a slow transition into a ketogenic diet, maybe dropping your carbohydrates if you re at 200 down to 150 and just do it in 50 gram increments ''another option would be the use of exogenous ketones  when you go on a ketogenic diet, your brain goes through what i call glucose withdrawal effects  you might be able to fill that gap initially, until your body starts making ketones, regulating the transport and utilization of ketones  you might be able to fill that gap by taking exogenous ketones or just using something like medium change triglyceride  the c8 would be the most ketogenic fat out there ''another issue that females run into is that, when a lot of women start this, they tend to start a ketogenic diet in a calorie deficit  so they go right into a calorie restricted ketogenic diet and you have sort of the double whammy ''you have very little glucose getting to the brain, and then calorie restriction on top of a radical shift in macro nutrient profile of the diet  they re going to get a reactive response from that  hypoglycemia  in some women, it can manifest itself in strange ways, from fainting to irritability to foggy headedness  so the idea would be, my suggestion would be to keep your calories actually higher when you start the ketogenic diet  so you want a calorie surplus, at least initially to help with the transition that s high in fat  it s hard for some people, especially in the fitness industry ''when they start a ketogenic diet, they have to be not afraid of eating fat  100 grams of fat per day is really not a lot of fat  getting upwards to 200, 250, and 300 even on some days  so for the average size female, you want to get at least 100 grams of fat, upwards, depending on your size and your output, maybe even up to 200 grams of fat  that would be my suggestion to help with females ''now, the hormonal changes that have been reported by some females following a ketogenic diet  suppression of thyroid, that seems to be one of the major concerns  when i probe a little deeper, the people who are getting a suppression of some of their hormones, they re exercising a minimum of two, sometimes four or six hours a day training for an event ''so the scenario is you re transitioning your body to a new diet, high carb to low carb, on top of calorie restriction  you have an energy deficit that s caused by a restriction of calories, it appears, and also over training  over training is the fastest way to really kick down your hormones  for males, it manifests as low testosterone  for females, it can manifest in many different ways  what i see most is reduction in t3 ''the next question comes from cammy orion  she asks ''can a female obtain a sub 10 percent body fat with a ketogenic diet? if so, is there a daily calorie threshold relative to my basal metabolic rate or other factors to reach that level of body fat? ''this is also kind of another common question  women wanting to use the ketogenic diet to get as lean as possible  a lot of women in the fitness industry are fitness competitors who are using this approach  the first question, i don t know what she s doing  if this is for cosmetic reasons or if she is an athlete and wanting to just perform as optimally as possible and thinks she needs to get below 10 percent body fat ''so the first question i would have for her is why do you want to get below 10 percent body fat? essential fat, from my understanding, in women is between 8 and 12 percent  so roughly 10 percent is needed for normal physiological hormonal body functions in women ''i think it s ip to keep above that and it s highly dependent upon the person  some women are just naturally very lean, and other women have a higher set point  i would advise against trying to achieve 10 percent body fat for performance unless you re genetically exceptionally lean to begin with  when highly trained women at just 15 percent body fat, which is very lean for a woman, trains and diets to sub 10 percent body fat, they tend to get these hormonal issues  i would call it functional hypothalamic amenorrhea  so it even has a term  i just read an article on this  this is extremely common in the fitness industry, and sometimes it s not easily, readily reversible ''so if the ketogenic diet approach is used, it will be a greater fat turnover and i would advise, sort of like the last question, against consuming less than 100 grams of fat  some of the macros that were sent to me by women who were doing the ketogenic diet were like 60 grams of fat  upwards of 70 and 80 grams of fat and they thought that was very high  i would against consuming less than 100 grams of fat, especially for a female athlete ''consuming this level of fat keeps your fat metabolism optimized  it also is the source of ketones, of making ketones  so probably the most experienced individuals on this topic, achieving sub 10 percent body fat, would be female fitness competitors who routinely get below 10 percent ''and as mentioned, they do report a lot of menstruation irregularities  women who have successfully implemented the ketogenic diet and are aware of how to do so, so some of the women who come to mind would be shannan yorton penna from quest nutrition, who is really a very experienced fitness competitor and just an overall great person  she has been in a state of ketosis i think for at least two years, now  quest nutrition is developing, testing, and ultimately will be marketing ketogenic diet food products  they already have the quest mct oil powder, which is fantastic ''the next question comes from renee vocho ''how does ketosis affect the microbiota, specifically the balance of fermicutes to bacteroides? ''so that s a great question  it s highly dependent upon the diet that your following  we re just at the cusp of understanding the gut microbiome  relating this question to the ketogenic diet and to give an answer on it is kind of difficult because there are many variations of the ketogenic diet ''the modified atkins would be much more liberal in the amount of vegetables that you consume  what i ve garnered just from reading what i can as far as studies that have been done and talking with the scientists who are in this area of research, is that you can train your gut microbiome to sort of be ketogenic ''there are bacterial species in your gut, and i have a list of them, that actually thrive off fat  these bacterial species tend to be the beneficial ones  they re very good for us  so that changes dramatically  when we change our diet, our gut microbiome also changes its diet and will adjust the ratios of various species in the gut and a shift towards more bacterial species that thrive off fat  my general recommendations to optimize the microbiome, and my knowledge is nowhere near that of researchers out there like alessio fasano who is the chair of pediatrics at harvard medical school  he actually gave a fantastic ihmc lecture on this topic  ihmc is the institute for human and machine cognition ''so i would recommend that listeners go to that lecture and look up alessio fasano  he does not study the ketogenic diet but he is the leading expert and most knowledgeable person out there on the gut microbiome  so for those following a ketogenic diet, things that i think could optimize the microbiome would be sort of the obvious things we talk about or hear about, which would be probiotics  so green vegetables, preferably in raw form, salads, things like asparagus, artichoke  cinnamon is kind of prebiotic  and probiotics, so lactobacillus, bifidus  there are a number of other bacteria out there that could be supplemented ''i don t feel like the ketogenic diet would compromise the gut microbiome in any way, even in those individuals who limit their fiber  so i haven t heard that that s been a problem for them  but to prevent it from being a potential problem, the use of these prebiotics and probiotics, fermented foods, things like sour cream are part of my diet  and it s important to pick a sour cream that has a good complement of live cultures in it  another thing that people have emailed me about, and i think rhonda patrick actually mentioned this to me in passing about the benefits of a supplement called vsl3, or vsl 3 supplement ''i haven t taken it myself but just from the number of emails i got from people who have taken the supplement, and they ve taken it with the ketogenic diet   not that they had problems before the ketogenic diet   but they felt it was a good complement to the ketogenic diet  the vsl 3 supplement is a probiotic supplement  it s used for people with crone s disease, colitis, ibs  if you ve used an antibiotic, which i just did, actually  i just finished a course of antibiotics ''i got a strange bug bite in southeast asia that got infected and almost looked like mersa  so i took a full course of antibiotics and used a probiotic supplement that was similar to vsl 3 and had absolutely no issue with any kind of gut problems  the last time i used an antibiotic was over 20 years ago and it completely destroyed my gut  this time, i took a probiotic supplement and had absolutely no problems ''i don t know if i would have had problems if i didn t take the supplement but it helped  so a probiotic supplement might be good  i guess the lesson i learned is when you travel, when you move someone to a different location for any sufficient amount of time like weeks, you re changing their gut microbiome, and i think that really needs to be studied  i think in general, we need to understand if the ketogenic diet disrupts the microbiome, and we have to understand if things like travel can disrupt the microbiome ''i imagine there are many things that are disruptors of the gut microbiome  and as we start to do research, i think these things will be clearer  things that can optimize the microbiome, and i think probably more importantly, even for our servicemen and i know the department of defense is interested in this, nasa is interested in this ''obviously, a space environment or moving guys continuously across the globe is probably not the best way to optimize the gut microbiome  there are also questions about things like artificial sweeteners, if we re drinking chlorinated water, antibiotics in our food  many things to consider when we consider the gut microbiome  i went of on a tangent but when it comes to the ketogenic diet and the gut microbiome, we still have a lot to learn ''but my recommendations would be to have a diverse diet as much as possible  and from my understanding of the bacteria, there s going to be a bacterial shift from carbohydrate, thriving bacteria to bacterial species that thrive off fat  and from my understanding, that  snot a negative thing ''the next question comes from mary tacalotti  she is currently on the ketogenic diet, however she s confused ''should i count my calories? i m definitely restricting my carbs and increasing my fat intake  but keeping track of calories along with meal planning seems overwhelming  if i don t worry about calories, will i gain weight on the ketogenic diet? ''so yes, of course you will  that s simple thermal dynamics  if you re putting more calories into your body than you re burning off, those surplus calories are going to end up as stored body fat, or manifest itself as sort of metabolic derangement over time  a number of times when people transition to a ketogenic diet, they will just kind of go crazy with some of the ketogenic diet foods that are sort of indulgent ''that would be things like butter or sour cream  or i can sit down with a bag of macadamia nuts or cashews and polish that off pretty quick, and that s 1000 plus calories  this is really important to understand  the energy density of the ketogenic diet is about twice that of a normal diet  so the volume of food that you re eating is smaller, and it may seem like you re restricting  the volume of food that s on your plate will be much less than when you re not on a ketogenic diet, if you re keeping it isocaloric ''but chances are that over time, you ll inadvertently self restrict on the ketogenic diet  so your blood glucose will have far less fluctuations  you won t have these big, postprandial excursions in your glucose that kick off a surge of insulin that make you hypoglycemic a few hours later and make you crave another bolus of food again ''so that whole cycle is eliminated  that was really eliminated in me and was probably one of the most practical advantages i ve been able to realize from the ketogenic diet is the control of hunger  i think that has a huge carryover effect when it comes to being able to have control of your food intake, and not having your food intake control you  tracking is a very tedious process but when you do it, after a certain point you really don t have to  i can look at a piece of meat, or oil, or some green vegetables on my plate and just calculate the macros in my head, really  sometimes i ll just sort of weigh it out and double check to make sure i m right but after you follow the ketogenic diet, it s not a laborious process ''one trick i ve learned is that before dinner, which is my main meal of the day, i ll have a bowl of soup  the kind of soup i usually have is broccoli cream soup, or cream of mushroom soup and instead of using whole dairy cream, i use concentrated coconut milk in place of the dairy cream  i thin it out so it s not super dense in calories  after eating that, the amount of food that i want to consume is cut in half  obviously, that s a lot of calories but it s really super ketogenic ''the next question comes from dominic bushman, is his name  he asks ''how do you feel about the usual crappy food served at scientific conferences? ''and in parenthesis, the smartest people seem to have the worst lifestyle  he asks what are my nutritional tricks to survive attending these scientific conferences, which i m about to jump on a plane now and go to a scientific conference in europe  i know the foods are going to be very tempting over there  it s in budapest, actually  they have very good food over there  luckily, it s pretty keto friendly  i am not a purist when it comes to really following the ketogenic diet ''if someone was to follow me around when i m traveling and looking at what i m getting off the menu, they probably wouldn t think i m following any weird dietary patterns  you can almost always get a salad, and you can almost always ask for extra butter, extra olive oil to put on the chicken, beef or fish that i put on the salad ''generally, i limit dairy and protein when i m home but will indulge a little bit when i m traveling  and of course, cheese is ketogenic  my recommendations, or what i do as i ve probably mentioned before, is my bags are packed now and i have a case of sardines and a case of oysters, and they are packed in extra virgin olive oil  i also go to a store near me and i buy bulk macadamia nuts  i think macadamia nuts agree with me more than almonds or other types of nuts ''the conferences that i attend, they actually do have an appreciation for nutrition, and they have a fantastic array of food there  other conferences, not so much  people say i can t follow the ketogenic diet because i m a businessperson  i m traveling all the time  it s just not possible for me to follow this diet so what should i do?''i think the ketogenic diet is far easier to follow if you are that kind of person who is on the move all the time  the food that you re consuming is much more energy dense  it s less weight, it s less things that you have to carry in your bag  sardines and oysters and macadamia nuts take up a very small amount of weight, relatively speaking, and they have a really high energy density  i tend not to take a checked bag when i travel to scientific conferences  i can bring my carryon and i ve calculated this  i can get 10,000 calories of food in my carryon really easily and all my clothes for a week  i probably couldn t do that if i wasn t on a ketogenic diet ''the next question comes from willy churtman ''do stimulants aid in ketosis, and are there any particular stimulants that are good? ''yes, i think caffeine has a ton of research behind it  the military is a big fan of caffeine  the military has a really high bar in regards to their safety and in regards to their efficacy, and they re incorporated into different food products like the first strike ration ''this is something they make up in nadik at the combat feeding center there and it s basically just sugar and caffeine  i think they need to change that  but caffeine has long been a staple in my diet in the form of coffee  i am right now sipping on my coffee with mct  the caffeine is just starting to kick in and i fell it  i feel good on caffeine, and i don t feel any negative effects from it ''over 200 milligrams of caffeine in me raises my blood sugar  100 milligrams seems to be the sweet spot  200 milligrams of caffeine will cause an over activation of the sympathetic nervous system  it may produce some anxiety  caffeine mobilizes free fatty acids from adipose but it also breaks down glycogen from the liver  if my glucose is sitting at 70 and i take 200 milligrams of caffeine,''i ll see a bump up to 75, maybe even 80, with that amount of caffeine  but 100 milligrams seems to be a good sweet spot for me  there s caffeine as an appetite suppressant  it has antioxidant effects in the form of coffee  i have a couple papers on my desk  i started reading about the effects of coffee on liver function, to an improvement on liver function ''another stimulant that i like to talk about and i used a lot when i was younger is ephedrine hydrochloride  i don t know if it s still available  we use it in the lab  we did experiments on pseudoephedrine and cns oxygen toxicity  divers will pop lots of sudafed before they go diving because they want their sinuses to be clear so they can equalize  if you reserve a whole day to go diving and you re stuffed up and you can t equalize, then you re out of luck  you can t dive  it s too painful and can be really dangerous ''so ephedrine is actually pretty big in the diving community  i always took it before we went diving  we did a study showing that ephedrine can actually decrease latency to seizure  at a particular level of hyperbaric oxygen ''that would simulate a navy seal dive to, say, 132 feet of sea water  so you re getting an overstimulation in the brain with ephedrine, with a high dose  so that s the thing  it s all relating to the dose  i think ephedrine is a great stimulant that could aid in ketosis  it can help the release of fat from adipose and enhance beta oxidation of fat in the liver  personally, i ve seen that ephedrine can kick me into ketosis pretty fast, an ephedrine caffeine stack ''it can kick on afib in some people, especially if the dose gets high  50 milligrams or more per day  but a 25 milligram dose or less of ephedrine per day can elevate your mood, can cause pretty significant, noticeable appetite suppression  it s more of a psychological effect ''when it comes to getting a physiological response, 50 milligrams to 100 milligrams of day of ephedrine to get a really measurable increase in fat oxidation rates  that would give me side effects  and again, i m not sure if ephedrine is still legal so don t take this as a recommendation  but i think 25 milligrams of ephedrine can improve your adherence to a nutritional protocol just simply by suppressing your appetite and giving you more energy  you re going to want to go work out  you re going to want to exercise longer ''and i would strongly advise against the use of amphetamines  they re addictive and generally, people who take these things just have a bad outcome  they get addicted to it if not physiologically, psychologically ''modafinil is something i ve kind of been interested in testing but i ve never taken it  but i ve talked to people who have taken it  i did get an email just yesterday, actually, from a woman who has been on modafinil for over 15 years continuously  she was able to get off of it  she had narcolepsy  she was able to get off of it when she got into a stage of nutritional ketosis  she wrote me a really nice, long email just saying the ketogenic diet kind of saved her from this continuous abuse ''she thought her use of modafinil was more or less an abuse of it for many years  it s approved for military use before admission  so in a state where sleep deprivation is unavoidable and you need to maintain cognitive resilience, the use of modafinil can be a good idea ''tim actually asked me to address this question ''can a vegetarian or a vegan follow a ketogenic diet? ''you can look up beth zupec kania as the lead dietician for the charlie foundation  it may not be posted on the website but i know she works directly with patients and customizes vegetarian or even vegan ketogenic diet for many of her patients  to achieve ketosis, she uses higher amounts of mct oil  there are a couple of websites, too, that i noticed when i did a quick search online  ketomotive, k e t o m o t i v e and keto diet app are two websites that i find were really helpful in regards to listing the foods and listing different recipes that a vegetarian or vegan ketogenic diet could be adjusted to ''how do we help people who are vegan follow a ketogenic diet? i think the main problem would be the protein  it s just hard to put together foods that have a complement of essential amino acids  so you could just supplement with essential amino acids and that s one option  the other option would be plant based protein isolates that are hemp, rice protein isolate, you have pea protein isolate  ten years ago there was plant protein but it had a lot of carbs in it  nowadays, you can get 30 grams of protein with one or two or maybe three grams of carbs  that completely fits in with a vegan ketogenic diet ''one of the products that stood out just looking at the reviews on the taste and the macronutrient profile would be a product called mrn veggie elite protein powder, and the chocolate mocha is very good  if you take this mrn veggie elite protein powder and mix it with coconut cream, or what would be concentrated coconut milk, through in a half an avocado, pour in some mct oil   the ca oil, the mixture that i made up was 80 percent of the calories were from fat and 25 percent of the calories were from protein  so it s like one scoop of protein powder, i think  15 percent of the calories were from carbohydrates, and it was really pretty much fiber  high fiber carbohydrates ''this gives a ratio of 2 to 1  so 2 would be fat and the 1 would be a combination of carbs and protein, so relating it back to the classical john hopkins ketogenic ratios that they use  it s 900 calories  that s a good example of a pure vegan, and i posted that on my facebook yesterday  so yes, the ketogenic diet is possible  pretty easy for vegetarian and a little more difficult for a vegan  i m going to work on this, and maybe even work with a colleague of mine to write a book that covers this subject if someone hasn t written a book already  i see some blogs online but not a whole lot of resources out there for vegans who want to do a ketogenic diet ''the next question ''should i be concerned if the ketogenic diet increases my ldl or ldlp? ''i m a little bit concerned and i m still learning about it but if your ldl or ldlp skyrockets and stays elevated after several months, you might want to be concerned about it or pay more attention to tracking certain aspects of your health, particularly your inflammation and your blood lipid levels ''the number of ldl particles may be increased because you re also carrying more triglycerides  before you get a lipid profile test done and you start looking at these numbers, make sure that you re rested  make sure you re not stressed  make sure you don t have any kind of infection, which would increase it ''what i ve seen with the ketogenic diet is that the ldl will go up in about 50 percent of people who follow a ketogenic diet, especially if the calories are not restricted  if you re restricting calories on a ketogenic diet, which many people do who use the diet for the management of epilepsy or cancer, even in that population where the ketogenic diet is calorie restricted, about 25 percent of them will email back and say my doctor is following me and this is going up  but a lot less see this phenomenon if calories are restricted ''so i think it s important not to stress out about it and to kind of look at the big picture  the first book i had was the book from johns hopkins that was written by john freeman and eric kossoff  that described the classical, dairy based 4 to 1 ratio, classical ketogenic diet ''that shifted my numbers  interestingly, my ldl went up but so did my hdl, which doubled almost from 50 to almost 100 after about four to six months, i think  right now my hdl is 98  right now i ve transitioned into what i call a supplemented, modified atkins or modified ketogenic diet and supplemented because i do take in c8 and i do take in some exogenous ketones in the form of some of the products that are in the market, and i ll talk about that a little bit more  i m using a supplemented, modified ketogenic diet similar to the macro nutrient ratios that are described on the website  the charlie foundation website has a good description of the modified ketogenic diet  my ratio is looking pretty good ''my total cholesterol to hdl ratio is 2 4 right now from my last blood test  so my total cholesterol is 238 and my hdl is 98  triglycerides range from 40 to 70  these numbers are really similar to other people who have emailed me who were concerned  my marker of inflammation crp was really low  i m going to do a whole  inaudible  assay  when i was on a high carb diet, my crp was 2 4 a couple times  now it s  2  so literally in the last three blood works that i m looking at now, it ranged from  1 to  3  when i was on the high carb diet, it was literally ten times higher  i rarely have gotten sick when i m on a ketogenic diet ''and i do think that it helps with immune function  that s another area i could talk about  we talk about the ketogenic diet being kind of a panacea for everything  it cures the common cold  i have not had a cold, maybe one cold in the last six years  i used to routinely get a cold every year, at least once or twice a year  so in the last five years, i have one cold that i could remember  infection, i traveled overseas, i believe it was to honduras and i picked up some kind of stomach bug, or probably a virus, i think ''this really skyrocketed my ldl  so i talked a little bit about stress and infection sort of increasing that  that was really surprising  it was off the charts ''so it may have been something wrong with the test  but i think it s something to consider that when you do get these tests done, you want to make sure your body is truly at baseline when you re looking at the effects of the ketogenic diet  so in general, i would not be concerned with an elevated ldl unless other biomarkers were also out of whack  so the things to look at would be your triglycerides, your crp, and if your hdl goes down, that s not a good thing ''the thing that i focus on most is triglycerides  if your triglycerides are elevated, that means your body is just not adapting to the ketogenic diet  some people s triglycerides are elevated even when their calories are restricted  that s a sign that the ketogenic diet is not for you  you can t deny that  it s not a one size fits all diet ''you ll find about a quarter to a third of people just have these abnormalities in their blood work that would indicate they re not adapting to the diet  maybe they could give it more time but some people have given it three to four months and still have elevated triglycerides  pretty rare and most of the people i talk to thrive on a ketogenic diet but you do have many people who just should not follow it ''the next branch of questions i m going to address is exogenous ketones  this is a question that popped up recently and it comes from carson rowe  dozens of people have asked me this question so i want to address it right up front ''is it dangerous to use ketone salts, which are racemic? ''the ketone salts that are on the market now, from my understanding, have a d and an l configuration  dr  richard veech is a ketone expert on bulletproof podcasts  dr  veech said that he would avoid ketone salts at all costs  something about real versus mimicked molecules, etc  as dom and others, like patrick arnold, have said these are good and fine, what gives? so dr  veech, i admire for him and i d like to say dr  veech was kind of a mentor to me, getting into this area  i think it was back in 2008  i didn t even know that exogenous ketones existed until i found some of his patents, and patents that even predated his were from dr  andre brunengraber at case western  i think the first was a canadian patent in the early  90s on a ketone ester ''so dr  veech has been sort of a mentor to me in this process and helping me understand the benefits of exogenous ketones  his comments on dave asprey s podcast and most recently ben greenfield s podcast have created a lot of confusion  his comments were not scientific fact  they were his opinion  and that s really important to keep in mind ''also keep in mind that dr  veech has a lot of intellectual property tied up in the r enantiomer of the ketone ester  so more specifically, the (r) 3 butanediol r beta hydroxybutyrate monoester would be the main, single ester that he s focused on  the appearance of these ketone salts and the salt, the beta hydroxybutyrate is not completely tied up with sodium ''it s actually balanced across four different monovalent and divalent canones  you have sodium potassium, calcium and magnesium that many of these products are using, like the kegenix product, i think  the pruvit product, i m not exactly sure what the blend is  but dr  veech is kind of critical about the sodium content and about what he called the non natural isomer that was found in there  i know dr  veech has been working very hard for a decade or more to commercialize the monoester of the r beta hydroxybutyrate  so andre brunengraber, who is veech s colleague   they ve actually published together   demonstrated the metabolism of racemic ketones in a number of elegant studies ''these are tracer based studies where he labeled the carbons of the ketones and you could see where they go  it was clear from the science that the s enantiomer gets broken down to acetyl coa and can even inter convert back by further elevating levels of acetyl coa, that can actually feed back into the biosynthesis of the r beta hydroxybutyrate  there are a couple of nice papers that show that  the one that i m thinking about looked at the r and the s 1 3 butanediol metabolism in the liver of rats  there s no data to support dr  veech s claim that the ketone salts that are on the market are dangerous or ineffective ''that would include ketosports keto cana, pruvit s product keto os  the kegenix product is also using the racemic salt  forevergreen has product ketonics, or ketopia  many emails, dozens if not hundreds of emails i ve gotten from people who are concerned  dr  veech is a very esteemed researcher and i think he firmly believes that the r enantiomer is the way to go when it comes to exogenous ketones  and i did, too  actually, in our lab, the first ketone ester that we texted for cns oxygen toxicity was the 1 3 butanediol beta hydroxybutyrate mono ester and the r enantiomer and it didn t prevent oxygen toxicity seizures ''so elevated pretty much exclusively beta hydroxybutyrate  i was going to give up on the project and i discovered and earlier patent by andre brunengraber that had a 1 3 butanediol combined with acetoacetate  to me, it made perfect sense because when you consume it, it hydrolyzes in your gut so you release the acetoacetate and that s one of the ketones that the body uses ''and then the 1 3 butanediol goes to the liver and gets broken down completely to beta hydroxybutyrate and the pharmacokinetics are beautiful  you get kind of a 1 to 1 ratio of beta hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate in the liver  it was in that particular ketone ester gave remarkable neuro protection against cns oxygen toxicity ''so that was the second ketone ester that we tested  patrick arnold helped me synthesize it once we got the synthesis formula, and andre brunengraber was very kind to just give it to me and tell us how to do it  and that was racemic  so that was racemic 1 3 butanediol, which breaks down to the two enantiomer of beta hydroxybutyrate ''so it was remarkably effective in our hands  i knew there was more to the story than this  i ve also served with dr  veech on various workshops and can say he s very opinionated when it comes to the ketogenic diet  he thinks the diet is sort of a horrible diet and the high fat is very dangerous  we know that s not the case  there s not a whole lot of science to back up his claims ''i think there s one paper on kids in johns hopkins that follow the 4 to 1 classical ketogenic diet and i think many of the kids were put on a product called ketocal, which is like hydrogenated vegetable oils and things like that, and they had elevated triglycerides  not very surprising, right? so i think when we talk about the ketogenic diet, it s really important to acknowledge   and most people don t acknowledge this in the medical community   that there are many, many versions of the diet ''we have very little research  we still need to determine the optimal ketogenic diet in regards to the fatty acid profile  we know we need a much greater omega 3 to omega 6 ratio is going to be really important  the level of monounsaturated fats for saturated  i will say that no scientist, when it relates to the ketone salts, no scientist or toxicologist that i m aware of would find veech s comments to be true ''that the racemic salts are dangerous in any way  unless, of course, they re consumed at really high amounts  as we know, water is toxic in high amounts  all things are dangerous  caffeine, of course, i talked about  tylenol will quickly kill you if you take too much of it  many clinical studies actually show these racemic salts are very safe in high doses, even in kids given pure sodium beta hydroxybutyrate over periods of years ''that actually leads me to the next question, that was asked by emily bent  she asks ''what s dom s advice for fatty acid oxidation disorders, like mad or vlcadd, a medium chain or very long chain, acetyl coa dehydrogenase deficiency?''so mad is short for multiple acetyl coa dehydrogenase deficiency  since being added to newborn screenings, diagnoses have increased massively  so there are a lot more kids being diagnosed  the complications of this particular disorder can involve an acidosis, hypoglycemia, other symptoms such as general weakness, enlargement of the liver  enlargement of the heart is really a problem  so essentially what this disorder, multiple acyl coa dehydrogenase deficiency is, is a mitochondrial inefficiency  it s interesting ''if you just go to pubmed and type in madd, m a d d and ketones, this is just one of the disorders that can be effectively treated with racemic beta hydroxybutyrate salts  there are a number of studies  i m just going to pubmed now  first study pops up  highly efficient ketone body treatment in multiple acyl coa dehydrogenase deficiency related glucodystrophy  and that was published in pediatric research ''that was using the ketone salts essentially that are on the market, at least the racemic sodium beta hydroxybutyrate salts in these kids  there s a nice summary of that  another study by a different investigator  favorable outcome after physiological dose of sodium dl3, hydroxybutyrate in severe madd ''so sodium racemic beta hydroxybutyrate was given, and this can be given in an oral dose or it can be given iv in very high doses  no side effects from this  the dose that you need to get a measurable boost in blood ketones is not giving you a dangerous dose of sodium  that needs to be acknowledge and i think that was touched upon in dr  veech s talk  quote unquote, he said there is no way that these ketone salts could even increase ketones even point one or point two millimolar ''that s not the case  we know we can get levels into the 1 to 2 millimolar range if you take enough  i think as the technology evolves and we re creating various types of beta hydroxybutyrate salts for monovalent and divalent canones in addition to alkaline amino acids will combine nicely with beta hydroxybutyrate ''that s another avenue  you can kind of envision a blend of beta hydroxybutyrate spread across monovalent, divalent can ions and alkaline amino acids like lysine, argenine, histidine, citrulline  these all combine pretty nicely with beta hydroxybutyrate  another study actually comes from the lancet  shows dl 3 hydroxybutyrate so racemic beta hydroxybutyrate treatment as a sodium salt treatment of multiple acyl coa dehydrogenase deficiency  so it s a really nice study describing the use of this exogenous ketone in several patients that have this disorder  it was highly effective in treating that ''so in short, ketone salts, the racemic beta hydroxybutyrate are not dangerous and they re definitely not ineffective  more research needs to be done on all forms of exogenous ketone salts and also exogenous ketone esters  a lot of work has already been done  one could be more confident in the medical applications of this and even potential performance applications because when they re consumed, the liver function and kidney function is normal, even with really high doses ''the next question is jeff urbane ''is he truly behind involving kegenix? the website is kind of sketchy and the product itself has a surprising number of carbs  not sugars, obviously, but still ''so he s asking am i behind kegenix or involved in kegenix  the kegenix product on the market, the exogenous ketone product is a great product  i use it myself  i used it yesterday  sometimes i rotate different things if i m testing  it uses a ketone formula, a beta hydroxybutyrate medium chain triglyceride blend that we sort of developed and tested initially in the lab  we found that if you just take ketone salts, and at the time, these were the liquid sodium potassium salts found in ketoforce, we weren t really able to get an elevation of blood ketones that was really impressive before we started getting some gi discomfort and diarrhea ''we started tweaking and playing around with different formulas and found that if we took medium chain triglycerides and blended it together, we got a formula that the fat essentially was functioning like a controlled delivery system  so instead, the rapid peak was a little less rapid but it kept going up  it peaked at around 60 to 90 minutes and then extended out an additional hour or two beyond just taking the ketone salts, so when we blended it with mct it allowed the sustainment of ketones over time, which is kind of the big thing ''that s why with the kids that were administered a sodium beta hydroxybutyrate, they were given iv formulas  the gi sometimes doesn t tolerate it and when you bolus it in, the blood levels shoot up and quickly come back down  fat and fiber and protein, fat especially is a good controlled delivery system and there are ways to even package that and formulate it to optimize that ''so the kegenix product is not my product but they incorporate a patented formula that we developed and i don t own the patent  the university owns the patent  so kegenix has worked with our university  i use the product  i don t endorse the product  i need to use 1 5 packets blood into the 1 millimolar range  when you take it, you definitely feel lit  you don t want to take it after 3 or 4 in the afternoon  you take it early in the afternoon  i ll probably take it around lunchtime, 1 or 2  the energy focus you feel is definitely real  my blood work when i ve taken it continuously at a fairly high dose, looked really good  markers of inflammation almost non detectable ''my blood lipid profile was probably the best it s ever been since i ve been ketogenic  the carbs in there are very minimal  what i look at is the glycemic response to a dose, and it s pretty much flat lined in these  so there s no glycemic response, and a nice elevation in beta hydroxybutyrate ''next question, jimmy holman ''kegenix, keto os, pruvit, keto cream, is he affiliated with these like they claim? if not, does he recommend them? ''so i ve tried all the exogenous ketone products on the market  it s something i like to do  i like to figure out what formulas are going to be optimal from the standpoint of using these therapeutically, too ''so i feel like i m kind of at the forefront of understanding what blends of ketone esters, of ketone salts whether it be mineral salts or amino acid salts and other things  the fun for me is when you start combining these things together, and that s what we re doing now  we re doing mostly a lot of pharmacokinetics and toxicology work to understand what would be the optimal formula of blends ''is it five different types of salts with two esters in a different ratio with some c8 oil to sort of increase and sustain blood ketones over time? these are the questions that we re asking and some of the things we re testing now  i think the pruvit product tastes really good  it s smooth and creamy and has a much higher concentration of sodium, and maybe that s why  it has a salty, creamy taste  i ran out of it  i miss it  i was using it for awhile and i ran out ''so right now i m using the kegenix product, which is a pretty powerful product as far as the effects that i feel from it  the kegenix product, instead of a creamy taste, it has more of a tangy, bitter taste  it s got some green tea extract  so it does give you a little bit of a caffeine boost, maybe about 80 to 100 milligrams of caffeine and i think that s from the green tea extract  there might be some bitter orange in there ''there are a couple of thermogenics ingredients in there that you feel after you take the product, because you feel a little bit warm  forevergreen makes the ketonics product  it tastes really good and it has caffeine in the form of green tea, too  it s pretty similar to the kegenix product  it just has a different taste ''keep in mind that the early versions of these products were horrible  this is going back  i used to blend them  actually, i blended a mixture out and gave it to my friend peter attia, and peter wrote a great summary of his experience with using jet fuel  he s tested a lot of these things, the ketone esters and the ketone salts and did the study on the bike where he looked at oxygen consumption at a fixed power output  clamped it at 180 watts and then looked at oxygen consumption before exogenous ketones and after ''and at the time, peter was doing sort of a modified ketogenic approach so he was in a state of mild nutritional ketosis, like  6,  7  he took the ketone salts and it shot him up about 1 to 2 millimolar and kind of dosed him up with a blend that i knew would be approaching his gi tolerability ''i think he did okay  he didn t throw up or have diarrhea, from my understanding  he really cranked it out on the bike and showed that he was able to maintain the same power output and consume less oxygen, like 5 to 8 percent less oxygen, which is tremendous  we need to go and reproduce that study ''the next question comes from gavin williams ''what are his go to products? his mct powders, oils, ketone salts, anything else? ''we kind of covered this  i test whatever the companies send me  i love to test things  that s why i don t take a whole lot of supplements because i like to stay unaltered, i guess you could say, so i can confidently test these things  if i m measuring various blood, whether it be comprehensive blood work or blood glucose ketones, i know it s coming from that product ''i really enjoyed testing the pruvit product and i told you i miss it now that i m out of it  so if they re listening, they could send me some, please  the kegenix product is great  i think they re on version 2 or 3 of that now  one of the first times i tried the last formula that they gave me, i took the product at 7 p m  and it kind of kept me up a little bit later than i wanted  another product that s really a go to product, and i keep it at my house, at work, and it s in my suitcase my travel is the quest mct oil powder and the quest coconut powder is a big staple of mine  i ve talked about the foods that i ve consumed before, the wild planet sardines ''sardines are much more sustainable than tuna or some of the larger fish out there that these predatory fish also, through bioaccumulation, can accumulate toxins like mercury and other heavy metals  so it s non detectable levels of the things that are of concern, like mercury and other pcvs and other things that are out there  so that s important, especially if you re giving your fish to your young kids ''oysters are also one of my go to foods  the crown prince oysters are a really good brand that i like  lately there was a bone broth that i use  it s a little pricey but the company kindly sent me a sample of the test and it s called fire and kettle bone broth  i use it maybe twice a week  i ll make soup out of it and i think it s fantastic ''i think it s super high quality  another go to product would be scivation makes a product called extend perform, which is branched chain amino acids, leucine, and isoleucine valine in a 2 to 1 to 1 combination, leucine being the predominant branch chain amino acid in the formula  and we know that leucine is a powerful activator of mtor, which his a good thing ''activating mtor in skeletal muscle is really important in a short workout  i use the product pre workout and intra workout  i ve used the product a little bit during fasts  i think it could be an effective tool for mitigating some of the muscle loss that can accompany a longer, short term fast, if that makes sense, like five days or seven days ''so the extend perform product also has a mushroom blend in it  i actually researched all the mushrooms but it s leaving me exactly which blend it has in it  but the mushroom blend that s in there has been proven to have a pretty impressive data behind it as far as enhancing performance and for lowering inflammation, too ''the other supplements i take as staples would be if i m not getting a lot of sun, d3  so 5000 ius if i m not getting sun on days and when i m outside all day, i take 1000 ius  you don t want to get too much d3  so there s a bell curve and too much d3 will give you the same symptoms as too little vitamin d ''melatonin is something that i take  it s part of a sleep cocktail i will take  i use it when i cross time zones, and i ll use up to 10 milligrams  but for daily use, i will use anywhere between 1 to 3 to 5 milligrams  3 milligrams i think is what i have  idebenone is another product that i take when i fly, actually, or before hard exercise  i think of idebenone as kind of the drug version of coenzyme q10  it s more absorbable  it gets to the mitochondria easier  it s like a mitochondrial antioxidant ''it s almost considered a drug for the management of something called friederich s ataxia  i think in kids that take idebenone  it actually helps them out a lot  friederich s ataxia is really a tough disorder but from what i know in just talking with the fara foundation, i know a family and a child with friederich s ataxia  the research indicates that idebenone prevents cardio myopathy or hypertrophy  so it has a real effect ''idebenone has been shown to enhance cardiac function  it used to be kind of hard to find because it was reclassified as a drug but i know it s available on smartpowders com, which has a lot of really interesting things ''magnesium is a supplement i take daily  magnesium citrate, magnesium chloride and magnesium glycinate  i tried them all and they all impacted my blood magnesium levels in a good way  when i started the ketogenic diet, i started getting cramps  one thing that popped out in my blood work was that my magnesium was at the low end of normal  now that i m supplementing, now i am mid to high normal and i don t get any cramps  if i exercise more, i definitely deplete my magnesium ''so if you re exercising, just be sure that you re getting adequate magnesium  on the ketogenic diet i think you re excreting more magnesium  if i had one go to magnesium, it would be this magnesium citrate powder that i have  i ve looked at things like gaba before sleep, sometimes phenibut, which is phenylated gaba  so gaba that has a phenyl ring attached to it  it makes it permeable to the blood brain barrier ''it makes it more lipophilic  and when you take phenibut, you feel it  i feel it  you feel much calmer  i get really deep, almost scary dreams when i take phenibut  it has a pretty good calming effect so i will use phenibut maybe two or three times a month, if that  i tend to use it when i travel across time zones  i ll take a phenibut melatonin stack before i go to bed ''next question, leo falzone ''are exogenous ketones, i e  keto cana, only useful in a state of ketosis or would they benefit someone who is not keto adapted? put differently, can ketones enter the tca cycle, also known as the kreb cycle, when glucose is still available to the cell? or will the body preferentially use glucose, nullifying the effect of the ketones?''so ketones can be readily transported into tissues as fuel if glucose is low or high  and i think the body will sort of use what s available  so if the glucose is low, it ll use a greater proportion of ketones for energy  there is some tissue specificity in regards to the monocarboxylic acid transporter  and there are transporters one, two, three, and four  these have sort of different tissue distributions ''the brain is pretty high in mct2 and 3, i believe  the liver is a ketone producer but doesn t use ketones for fuel  and skeletal muscle is kind of in between  some data indicates that there may be enhanced glucose uptake and utilization in the presence of ketones ''i know dr  veech and others believe that ketones influence insulin sensitivity  it does it through a number of mechanisms  i think through altering redox chemistry, it can do two things  it can enhance the sensitivity of the insulin receptor to the ligand insulin  it can also cause sort of a translocation of the receptor to the membrane so there are more receptors that are available  i was a little hesitant to believe some of that but our new data we recently published shows that as ketones go up, and this is giving a bolus of exogenous ketones to an animal that s eating a high carbohydrate standard rat chow  glucose goes down ''we don t know why that s happening but part of the effect could be enhanced glucose disposal through enhanced insulin sensitivity and other things that we don t fully understand  some of the data that we ll be collecting that may shed light on this is looking at the global metabolomic profile of the liver, with and without exogenous ketones and how that s influencing liver metabolism  so an alternative explanation could be a decrease in hepatic gluconeogenesis  so i think it may be a number of things working together ''adam rokhorst has a question ''can exogenous ketones combined with a low carb diet   in parentheses, but not a ketogenic diet   still give some or all of the benefits of a strict ketogenic diet?''the experiments that we run with exogenous ketones, most of them, excluding the one cancer experiment when we combined the ketogenic diet with ketone ester  so our experiments are typically run using exogenous ketones given to animals eating a standard high carb rodent chow  so i would say yes to this  and i would say yes because our first experiment, originally what i wanted to do was give ketone esters for one week and dive rats down to five atmospheres of oxygen, which is 132 feet of sea water  and we know that they have a seizure in about ten minutes  and look at that latency to seizure ''after talking with a number of experts, and dr  veech, too, we thought the ketones would work immediately  but a number of the experts are convincing me that you needed to be keto adapted to get the benefits of exogenous ketones, to get the optimal benefits, i ll say ''i thought they were right because we actually tried dr  veech s version of the mono ester of beta hydroxybutyrate and it didn t prevent oxygen toxicity seizures, at least in acute dose  so i was more inclined to believe that you needed continuous, kind of long term dosing to get the brain to switch over  but then we tried the 1 3 butanediol acetoacetate dye ester, which rapidly elevated beta hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate  and that a single dose, 30 minutes prior to a five atmosphere dive gave like 600 percent neuro protection or delayed the latency to seizure from ten minutes to over an hour  which was pretty much more effective than any anti convulsing drug ever tested ''that was just simply feeding an animal that s eating a high carb diet, titrating in the dosage just enough to elevate blood ketones to a level of ketosis on par with a person fasting for one week  so you had prolonged fasting level ketosis in 30 minutes  and unlike drugs where you get a variety of effects, it worked in this animal and not that animal  every single animal we tested, we saw this remarkable neuro protection with the ketone esters  so that was not my original hypothesis that it would work this way but it did ''i guess dr  veech was right  not right about the ester  i think we needed not only beta hydroxybutyrate, we needed acetoacetate  and his particular ester did not elevate that  i think beta hydroxybutyrate, elevating that, would for his   he s looking at exercise performance and cognitive benefits, too ''i think it would work, beta hydroxybutyrate alone, remarkably well for that  but when it comes to mitigating oxygen toxicity seizures, and also other seizures, the alamodels, it s very clear that you need to have an elevation of acetoacetate  and that spontaneously decarboxylates the acetone  and we know that can open potassium channels and hyper polarize the resting membrane potential and mitigate some of the glutamate exciter toxicity that s thought to be involved in seizure genesis ''and you don t get that with just beta hydroxybutyrate ester  so to answer your question, yes, i think you can get exogenous ketones  i went off on a tangent  if you re really talking about combining exogenous ketones to a low carb diet, can you get the benefits?''absolutely, i think you can do that  even on a moderate carb diet, you can probably get the benefits  there are so many benefits to a low carb diet in and of itself that we know about, i think it just makes sense to use it with some kind of carbohydrate restriction  that s really important  if you look at our cancer study, we did the ketogenic diet and hyperbaric oxygen and that had a remarkable effect at prolonging survival in a model of advanced metastatic cancer ''when we combined the ketogenic diet with hyperbaric oxygen and we combined ketone supplementation, we had a really significant increase in survival and suppression of tumor growth and also metastasis '"
180,188,"Dom D’Agostino on Disease Prevention, Cancer, and Living Longer (#188)","'he is an associate professor in the department of molecular pharmacology and physiology at the university of south florida morsani college of medicine, and a senior research scientist at the institute for human and machine cognition (ihmc), which also has a great treatment in the current issue of outside magazine, on which there is a clown who looks a lot like me  he has also deadlifted 500 pounds for 10 reps after a seven day fast  he s a beast  also a good friend of dr  peter attia, who has also been on this podcast ''the primary focus of dom s laboratory is developing and testing metabolic therapies, including ketogenic diets, ketone esters and ketone supplements to induce nutritional or therapeutic ketosis and low toxicity, metabolic based drugs ''that s a mouthful, eh? much of his work is related to metabolic therapies and nutritional strategies for peak performance and resilience in extreme environments  this is where i get pretty interested  i recently went up to altitude and used exogenous (not androgynous), exogenous ketones to help me acclimate and function at high altitude  but it also works in the opposite direction, under water, for instance  both related to hypoxia ''his research is therefore supported by, among others, the office of naval research, the department of defense, and other private organizations and foundations  in this part 3   dom has been on twice before   dom focuses on disease prevention, cancer, and more mastery of the ketogenic diet  so, as i always say, without further ado, please enjoy this tutorial and master class with dominic d agostino ''dominic d agostino  okay, i covered the ketogenic diet and i covered questions about exogenous ketones  that took about two hours  so now i m going to into cancer research questions, or just question in general about cancer  the first one i d like to address   i ve gotten many emails about this and i ve seen a few questions on facebook ''does the ketogenic diet beat chemo for all cancers?''i would say absolutely not  but that does not mean that it should not be used as an adjutant or a support for various cancer therapies that are out there ''a number of situations where the ketogenic diet may not be the preferred therapy for most cancers, i would say leukemia, lymphomas, hodgkin s lymphoma, thyroid cancer, testicular cancer  if caught early, prostate cancer, melanoma, breast cancer, all these cancers can be effectively treated with chemotherapy or radiation in some cases ''and also, brain tumors, if it s class 1 or a class 2 tumor or grade 1 and 2 that s not very metastatic and it s more localized, then surgery, radiation, chemo can be very effective  we focus on cancers that are not really treated effectively with the standard of care  brain tumors grade 4 would be a glioblastoma cancer  it s highly invasive, highly aggressive, sort of has a metabolic phenotype  we say that expresses the warburg effect  so it s very glycolytic  so the name  glioblastoma multi form,  is comprised of very diverse, heterogeneous array of cells that are resistant to therapy ''it s genetically very heterogeneous  metabolically, probably much more homogenous in regard to being able to target it from a metabolic standpoint  so we focus on this aggressive metastatic cancer and brain tumors in our lab  the standard of care, we know that it does very little  we do feel that the ketogenic diet, when properly administered, can dramatically enhance the efficacy of standard of care ''so even though the standard of care may not buy much time for a patient with glioblastoma, we think that we could dramatically enhance the efficacy and maybe reduce the side effects of standard of care with the ketogenic diet or maybe combined with intermittent fasting  i would recommend looking at the work of dr  adrienne scheck ''she s at barrow neurological institute  she s done some studies with a pre clinical mouse model of glioblastoma  that work has inspired a clinical trial that s now recruiting patients to use the ketogenic diet combined with the standard of care, which would be temozolamide and radiation  her work is really remarkable in that it shows the ketogenic diet dramatically enhances the efficacy of radiation therapy  it does that through a number of different mechanisms that she s looking at  i think, most importantly, to highlight if we look at the sum of all her work, which is an incredible body of work that she s done  she was working on this long before i came into the field ''i was directed to her by dr  jung rho, who is probably the leading ketogenic diet researcher and chair of pediatrics in calgary now, but he was at barrow neurological institute ''i contacted him and he directed me to adrienne scheck s work and it really blew me away  she shows the effective of the diet can be dramatically enhanced with radiation  i was pretty critical of radiation therapy for cancer, especially for glioblastoma, for various reasons  but when looking at adrienne s work and just hearing feedback from patients, my thoughts on radiation therapy have softened a bit  in the context of radiation therapy given with ketogenic diet, it appears that nutritional ketosis enhances the tumor killing effect of radiation ''it does that through a number of different mechanisms, probably crippling or reducing glycolytic flux through the tumors, which would impact their antioxidant, endogenous antioxidant status by reducing things like the pentos phosphate pathway, which helps the cell regenerate glutathione  we know that the efficacy of the radiation therapy really results from generating oxygen free radicals in the tumor tissue  tumor cells are already at an elevated state of oxidative stress, so further stimulating reactive oxygen species production with the damaging effects of radiation can put them over the edge and be very destructive ''so the ketogenic diet seems to enhance that process and simultaneously, the ketones tend to lower inflammation in the normal, healthy tissue and protect your normal, healthy brain tissue ''we think that there s a lot of potential for the ketogenic diet as an adjutant  for all our studies, we ve always used the ketogenic diet as one piece of a combined metabolic therapy approach  so the ketogenic diet is an adjutant to hyperbaric oxygen that we ve used  now we re looking at ketone supplementation and combining that with hyperbaric oxygen  so the ketone supplements tend to further augment the therapeutic efficacy of the ketogenic diet by lowering blood glucose and elevating blood ketone levels  that therapeutic zone that tom seyfried calls the  metabolic zone  ''the glucose ketone index is simply the ketones, the glucose by the ketones  the index of one or two, really an index of one is what you want to shoot for ''when you achieve an index of one, you essentially get a blood glucose level and blood ketone level that are essentially the same  so 3 5 millimolar, a level of glucose and ketones that a person could sustain and would be physiologically optimized  he has a paper on that in nutrition and metabolism describing the glucose ketone index  that has been thought to be sort of the optimal therapeutic zone for a patient using the ketogenic diet to manage their cancer or combine it with the standard of care  so it makes sense to use a metabolic based approach on tumors that have a warburg phenotype ''so tumors that are highly glycolytic, which include about 80 to 90 percent of cancers  the cancers that tend not to be the ones that are more glycolytic are also the ones that you don t have to worry so much about ''these are cancer cells that generally are not very invasive or aggressive in regard to growth   the ones that are not glycolytic  so cancer cells, for example, that wouldn t show up on a pet scan  that would be like prostate cancer, for example  yeah, the ketogenic diet does not beat chemo  we know that chemo can be effective for a number of different cancers and if caught early, sort of a growing list of different types of cancers ''ramsey metcalf asked a question ''after listening to his chat on dr  rhonda patrick s show, i want to know more about the detoxifying effects of ketosis on pre cancer cells and on healthy individuals and how does one jumpstart daily ketogenic cycle without supplements? how can you maintain lean muscle mass when fasting?''so a number of questions there  as i mentioned, i ll refer back to the metabolic zone  achieving the metabolic zone and glucose ketone index of one or two  so google the glucose ketone index and download that paper in nutrition and metabolism  it s open access  it gives you a description of where you have to be when you do fasting or the ketogenic diet  if you achieve that zone, i think that   and you do that two or three times a year   that could be very therapeutic in regard to cancer prevention really effective at targeting pre cancerous cells and maybe even jumpstarting your immune system, making your immune system maybe more hypervigilant against the cancer cells that you already have ''so as far as jumpstarting your body into ketosis, you could use exogenous ketones ''okay, without supplements you ask  jumpstarting can be done with exercise  i wouldn t recommend vigorous exercise  i would recommend a walk, a two or three hour walk, for example  you might want to preface that with a short, high intensity, 10 to 15 minutes, something to just kind of activate your sympathetic nervous system, but not too much  do some pushups, chin ups, a little bit of a few sprints ''i believe that when you activate your sympathetic nervous system, mobilize your assets for fuel and set your body up for a more effective fat burning and a more effective transition into ketosis when you do a low impact walk  i ve done a lot of testing on myself of glucose and ketone levels in different scenarios and that seems to work really well ''i did that yesterday, actually  so fasting can stimulate autophagy, perhaps, make the immune system more hypervigilant against cancer and pre cancer cells, i mentioned  but you need to acknowledge that if you fast too long or you calorie restrict too long, that can suppress your immune system  let me see   lean body mass  so there s a couple ways to get around the loss of lean body mass that s going to happen  you have to realize that you re losing a lot of water when you do a fast  so your weight may go down, but a lot of it s going to be water weight ''you could probably mitigate some of the muscle loss with branched chain amino acids  i would buy just a pure branched chain amino acid product that s just branched chain amino acids and nothing else  consume that  if you re going to continue to do any form of exercise, i wouldn t recommend doing high intensity exercise if you re fasting ''but if you do any exercise, take your branched chain amino acids before and maybe during  it s important and i always emphasize this when people talk about  wasting away  when you fast  george cahill s work at harvard shows that the physiological shift that occurs when you re fasting, when you enter a state of fasting ketosis, functions to have a really profound protein sparing effect ''so your brain is a highly metabolic organ and it s a big glucose sink  when you elevate ketones that prevents a lot of the gluconeogenic amino acids from being broken down in the skeletal muscle  so it s very protein sparing in that regard  so otherwise, if we fasted, we would rapidly waste away, probably in less than two weeks ''but there s reports of people fasting   there s a guy who was 500 pounds that fasted for over a year  there were no major ill effects reported from that  he fasted down to 190 pounds  some of the helpful supplements that i think utilized during a fast would be, like i mentioned, branched chain amino acids  my good friend, layne norton, did his ph d  on leucine and he did in the lab with donald layman  so if you re interesting in understanding anabolic or anti catabolic effects of branched chain amino acids, go on pubmed and look up layne norton studies on leucine ''i ve experimented with a few things  i think the serotonin precursor, 5 htp, can be beneficial if we re taking in branched chain amino acids, we re actually limiting the transport of tryptophan across the blood brain barrier because it competes ''i tend to get the munchies at night, so my appetite gets really high at nighttime when i was fasting  i fasted with branched chain amino acids, but i think a supplement like 5 htp at night may be able to reduce some of the hunger cravings and also help put you to sleep  so if i m hungry, i found it hard to sleep  after a while, my body adapted to it  so that product  ketones, mct oil and mct oil powder may be helpful, but not absolutely necessary  there s a book out there called the fasting cure by upton sinclair  just google  the fasting cure  and  sinclair  and you ll find it  it s a free pdf download  it s a fascinating little book that just talks about the benefits of fasting ''so next question is lowell kubic  he asks ''in addition to an update on ketosis effects on cancer, is there any updates with ketosis affecting chemotherapy recovery? what types of cancers does ketosis have the largest impact on?''so i kind of answered that already  managing brain tumors and metastatic cancer i would say would be at the top of the list  and as i mentioned, as an adjutant to chemo and radiation, see adrienne scheck s work at barrow neurological institute, her pre clinical work and also an ongoing clinical trial ''i would also encourage anyone who s really passionate about seeing this transition into the patient population, if they re interested, they could support adrienne scheck s work at barrow  it s difficult to get funding for these types of studies ''i know the project was stopped and started because of funding  i don t think it s a lot of money, either  so if you look up adrienne scheck s work and maybe she may have some kind of donation link there  i m not sure if she does, but it would be great for people listening to support her work in that clinical trial because there s a lot riding on that trial  the research is being conducted in a way that really fits the criteria we think is important  so we re being assured that the patients are actually in ketosis and they re monitored and recorded in ways that ll really help get questions answered ''the clinical trial is in progress right now  so they re continuing to recruit more patients  most effective for targeting cancer, this warburg phenotype ''that would be like 80 to 90 percent of cancers will have an increase in or demonstrate high intensity on fluorodeoxyglucose pet scan  these are the cancer cells that are more glycolytic are also the ones that are going to be more invasive and more deadly  they re the ones that are growing more rapidly  so as they re consuming more glucose, that glucose is shuttled to not only energy, but also the biomass of the tumor ''so when you re imaging the cancer cells lighting up, they re shuttling all that glucose to increase the biomass of the tumor  when you look at prostate cancer, where it s not lighting up, it s growing so slow that its glucose demands are not that high  in many cases, probably just better left alone ''when people are diagnosed with having a tumor, they think about it as this alien that needs to be chopped out of the body with slash and burn techniques  but there s many autopsies   i was reading a number of books and papers on this   there s many autopsies that have been done on people that die from completely unrelated causes that are full of tumors  that have tumors and absolutely no problems at all  so they may have lived many years, if not decades, with tumors and had no problems at all  so if you re diagnosed, that s why just watching and waiting is an important thing  we can live with cancer, many types of tumors with no problems ''dr  fein and dr  feinman, i believe, did some work in vitro on multiple different cancer types with ketones ''the gist of their work was that a large majority of cancer cells cannot effectively use ketones for energy  that goes across multiple different cancer cell lines  i know dr  brant reynolds, he s doing work at university of florida in gainesville  he s done work, pre clinical work on colon cancer, breast cancer, and glioblastoma  some of the glioblastoma cells were taken from patients  he uses a patient derived xenograft model  i think most importantly, the evidence points to the ketogenic diet as doing no harm  do no harm therapy  so we know through at least two or three, two pilot trials, that the ketogenic diet is well tolerated ''we know from the epilepsy community that the ketogenic diet is very well tolerated  i think it was melanie schmidt that did work on   the title of the paper was  the effects of the ketogenic diet on the quality of life of 16 patients with advanced cancer  a pilot trial   so those that completed the diet for three months of treatment, there were patients with ovarian, breast, sarcoma, osteosarcoma, esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, thyroid, colon, endometrial, lung, and stomach cancers ''so a variety of different cancers  there was an improved quality of life and there was no major adverse effects on various blood parameters  the side effects reported were really minimal ''so they were temporary constipation and fatigue  there s a lot of good evidence already that the ketogenic diet can work on a variety of different cancers  we need more studies  some of those studies are in progress ''i m going to transition now to random questions here  so scott shearer asks   i know scott, hey scott ''talk about ketosis and hyperbaric oxygen therapy  how, why and when?''so it s a good question  i think it s going to vary depending upon the individual  i think generally, younger patients can tolerate more hyperbaric oxygen and get benefits from it  so with hyperbaric oxygen therapy, you get the immediate benefits from hyper oxygenating the area that you re trying to treat ''whether that be an ischemic wound, you re trying to reverse tumor hypoxia and saturate a tumor with oxygen to stimulate oxidative stress, right? you need apoptosis in the cancer, which is much like a wound, actually  so you have that effect  if someone has a brain tumor, they re going to be more susceptible to cns oxygen toxicity  so you want to start them really lower, like 1 5 atmospheres of oxygen and do that for 45 to 60 minutes and then work up from there  so the protocol that we used in our pre clinical model was 2 5 atmospheres of oxygen three times a week and that varies from what s used for wound healing, which is kind of monday through friday, five times a week ''two atmospheres of oxygen  so it really depends on who you re treating, what you re treating  the approved therapies for hyperbaric oxygen, there s like 14 different fda approved and you have air and gas embolism  you have bone infections  osteomyelitis  burns  carbon monoxide poisoning  so you would want to use the maximum concentration of oxygen to get to push that carbon monoxide off of the hemoglobin molecule ''it s also occupying cytochrome for the electron transport genes causing tissue hypoxia  so you want the maximum amount of oxygen for that or tolerable  certain types of brain or sinus infections, decompression sickness, so this is sort of gas gangrene is another that s an anaerobic bacteria ''so hyper oxygenating it can help to kill it  necrotizing soft tissue infections, radiation injury  for example, damage from radiation therapy for cancer can be effectively treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy  skin grafts and wounds that have not healed with other treatments  for example, treating a foot ulcer or someone with diabetes or very bad circulation  the wound healing process is enhanced by increasing tissue profusion or increasing the oxygen content within that actual tissue ''lowering reactive oxygen species, which is kind of a secondary effect, and lowering inflammation  so when it comes to cancer, so that would be an off label use  a non fda approved use of hyperbaric oxygen if you re not getting radiation therapy ''i would ask you just to look at some of the research that my colleague, research associate, dr  angela poff, was first author on a number of manuscripts  if you just google  ketogenic diet  and  hyperbaric oxygen   so we have a number of manuscripts that are open access and that are downloadable that describe the use of this approach, the combination of nutritional ketosis with a diet or supplemented ketogenic diet with hyperbaric oxygen  we think that this combination is not only effective, but nutritional ketosis will enhance the safety and the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen by preventing the potential of cns oxygen toxicity seizures ''so the limitation of a navy seal diver is cns oxygen toxicity  the limitation of the therapeutic potential of hyperbaric oxygen therapy is the limitation of the dose to avoid cns oxygen toxicity  so we can more safely use a higher dose of hyperbaric oxygen therapy and sort of blast the tumor with high levels of oxygen and oxidative stress, we could do that more safely in the context of getting the patient into nutritional ketosis ''we think that nutritional ketosis will cripple the antioxidant defenses of the highly glycolytic tumor cells that rely pretty heavily on the pentos phosphate pathway or shunt to generate the reduced intermediates and to actually generate the glutathione, reduce glutathione in the cell ''so that process is limited or crippled when a patient is achieving that metabolic zone and so the hyperbaric oxygen therapy would work much more effectively ''next question, justin bolman ''how long would an amateur endurance athlete need to be in ketosis to get the full benefit of being fat adapted for a marathon? what would you recommend as a supplement stack to fuel a marathon? for example, mct powder combined with map essential amino acids? sodium and some form of electrolyte every hour?''good question and it s one that i get often, so i include it in here  ben greenfield has spoken pretty extensively on intra race supplementation  any ketone supplement that you use during a race you want to make sure that you ve tested that pretty thoroughly before you actually use it ''you know, you ve tested it through your training extensively and titrated it up to the point where you start to get gi stress  so you want to make sure that you know what kind of doses you can tolerate before you start using it for inter race supplementation  we ve done some experiments in the lab and i ve done experiments on myself  the pure caprylic triglyceride or the c8 may be the best alternative to medium chained triglycerides, which is a combination of the c8 and c10  so that would be helpful supplementation ''branched chain amino acids, i think, are really helpful  other than that, i think that your preparation that s really going to be most important is that you re adapted to burning those fuels ''the longer you re on a ketogenic diet or keto adapted, the more benefits you re going to derive from it and the easier it gets, too  so this may take months or even years to get fully optimized to the ketogenic diet  so when you switch fuel sources, your body s physiology doesn t automatically switch over  so there s a lot of complicated things happening from an up regulation of the transporters, there s enzyme systems, liver metabolism, gene expression ''for these to be fully manifested, it s going to take some time  it s going to take a significant amount of time to be fully optimal  from the really advanced athletes that have communicated with me, they said it took about a half a year for them to get their stride on ketogenic diet  so i would say just keep that in mind ''johnny valimer asked, this is a question i get often ''should an apo e4 carrier be careful with a ketogenic diet?''it s a great question  so interestingly, the study that was done by sam henderson which looked at the effects of an mct oil based product   at the time it was called ac1202   they looked at patients with mild cognitive impairment and found that the patient population that was apo e4 positive did not respond as favorably, at least to medium chain triglyceride supplementation in regard to enhancement of cognitive performance  they had a mild, very modest boost in beta hydroxybuterate ''i would direct your listeners, tim, to the ihmc stem talk  it was episode 12 with dr  dale bredesen  it discusses this topic fairly at length  it covers a lot of things that i was interested in as far as what the signaling effects apo e4 is manifested in the brain and how we can target that, actionable things that we can do as individuals to mitigate some of the effects of being apo e4 positive  we know that apo e4 seems to influence nf kappa b signaling  so the issue is apo e4 enhances the pro inflammatory effects of nf kappa b intends to reduce the activation of cert 1 ''so if we think about what the ketogenic diet does, and you can apply this to calorie restriction and intermittent fasting too  the metabolic and signaling effects of traditional ketosis would be favorable to those with apo e4  i would emphasize that not just an mct based supplement, which was done in the henderson study, using ac1202, which was published years back  but actual carbohydrate restriction associated with nutritional ketosis  inflammation is really the driver here from how i understand it  nutritional ketosis, intermittent fasting, all these things activate beneficial pathways that are down regulated by having this genotype ''it doesn t silence, but it attenuates a lot of the pro inflammatory pathways that are associated with being apo e4 positive  so having this apo e4 gene, these carriers would have a survival advantage in several different situations  so the negative effects of being an apo e4 carrier really happen later in life  so as we age, it ll be more important to follow nutritional ketosis and perhaps an intermittent fasting protocol  we know exercise increases bdnf  intermittent fasting, intermittent dietary restriction  so even if you re not fasting, do calorie restriction ''strength training  so strength training is going to build the lean body mass that functions in glucose disposal  so other supplements that may help individuals that are apo e4 would be berberine and maybe metformin too  i think we need to study that  i don t know if there s any   it would seem like an obvious thing to do a study on those that are apo e4 positive and the effects of metformin  so i know there s quite a few individuals out there  i ll look on clinicaltrials gov to see ''matthew maverich has a question regarding cheat meals ''any downside to kicking out of ketosis for an occasional cheat meal? or does one need long term, sustained ketosis to get the benefits? i found that i can get relatively fast, especially if i run the next day'' is what he says ''so there is no downside unless you are using it to manage a disease process  so andrew scarborough talked about having a brain tumor  i listened to his podcast yesterday  so i would definitely recommend your readers look up the podcast  i think it s on the quantified body by andrew scarborough, who has a grade 3 brain tumor and he s using the ketogenic diet and an interesting sort of list of supplements and foods to manage his brain tumor, above and beyond what he even said was possible  he happens to have seizures too  so the seizure would be an indication that he s not following, is getting out of the metabolic zone that is optimal for the management of the cancer ''so he called it like a blessing that the epilepsy sort of helped him with cancer management because when he got a seizure, it sort of was an indication   or an aura before having a seizure, sort of like a pre seizure event   and that he had a protocol that he could quickly administer things like magnesium chloride or exogenous ketones to quickly get him back into a state of ketosis  i don t know if you re an athlete or managing some kind of pathology, but an occasional cheat meal for performance i think is totally fine ''the problem that i run into if i do a cheat meal   i just call it like a re feed  i like eating a ketogenic diet, so i tend not to cheat that much  what i ll do is sometimes just eat more of the same foods  but occasionally i ll go out for sushi and have rice and some other things  what i notice when i do that is that i get hungry at night ''so i will wake up and instead of waking up at my normal time, i ll wake up an hour or two or three earlier and just be really hungry because the carbs that i ate the night before   if i cheat, it s usually in the evening   i ll get what is likely an insulin dump that makes me hypoglycemic in the middle of the night  if i don t have the ketones there, if the insulin shuts off my own ketone production, that my body senses that hypoglycemia and i wake up with the shakes i get that hypoglycemic effect at night  that happens ''that s what i notice  so my suggestion would be if you re going to do a cheat meal and if you re doing nutritional ketosis, do a slow carb approach and add sufficient amounts of fats  i think you ll get a better response ''if you do a cheat meal, i guess you re just trying to restore your glycogen levels or reset your system  i think you ll get a better restoration of liver and muscle glycogen and you ll get probably a better hormonal response in terms of restoring some of the hormones that may be suppressed, so t4 to t3 conversions or that sort of thing  if you sort of balance the meal out and just don t go crazy  keep in mind that a cheat meal can do an incredible amount of  damage  in regard to fat gain ''so it should be a calculated meal and you should cap it off and do some   you might not need to bring a scale with you, but just figure out how many calories you re going to eat  i m not going to go over 400 grams of carbs or something like that, because i ve seen people eat 1,000 grams of carbs in one sitting and that s no lie ''so if you tend to go out of control and eat a huge bowl of fries or just go out of control with chocolate cake or something like that, one strategy that i ve done is if i m going to go out and have sushi, for example, or have some kind of meal that s carbohydrates, i ll have a big bowl of soup before and that will send a signal to my brain  your brain is pretty good at sensing the amount of volume and weight of food that s in your stomach  so if you send that signal to your brain before you actually start eating the food that will cap off the amount of calories that you will comfortably be able to eat ''so the next question comes from blue light diet  so i assume it s the author of this book or website or whatever  and in caps, he says ''explain this, dominic d agostino  ketogenic diets have no metabolic advantage as shown from nusi study ''so i ve gotten a lot of emails about this  i know nusi is funding a lot of great research  i know one of the studies may have surfaced, at least in an abstract form at a conference in the form of a poster  so from my understanding, there s really nothing to explain  if calories are completely isocaloric between the diets, sure, that makes sense to me at least that there s not going to be sort of a metabolic advantage ''when i think of the ketogenic diet and when one sustains nutritional ketosis for some time, it s actually enhancing metabolic efficiency  there s some theories out there that if you follow ketogenic diet it ll increase brown fat accumulation, which could allow one to burn off more calories ''if you want to lose weight on a ketogenic diet, you simply have to calorie restrict  that s thermodynamics, right? just like a standard diet  so the advantage of   and i hope this comes out of the research, i m sure it will   the advantage from my perspective of a ketogenic diet is that your appetite is suppressed, so you naturally eat less  so you don t have these big postprandial blood glucose excursions and trigger a hypoglycemic response  it s not going to trigger cravings ''so i ve seen it in myself  i think that s the main advantage of the diet  if you want to hear a counter argument to what was sort of presented as  no metabolic advantage  from the ketogenic diet, there s a 10 minute youtube video that you can read from dr  david ludwig or dr  feinman s response to that ''so there s more data to emerge, but we ll leave it at that for now, until more of the studies start to surface ''so hamilton r  blair writes ''dom, in a podcast with rhonda patrick, you alluded to the fact that dairy doesn t do well for you and that you have a mild allergy to nuts  what are your primary sources of fact for a modified ketogenic diet? mcts, coconut cream, milk, oil, butter?''so my primary fat sources are eggs and i m kind of picky about the eggs that i get  i try to source out local eggs from free range chickens ''avocados, olive oil (yes), mct oil (probably about a third of my fat calories come from mct oil or coconut oil, a combination of the two), fatty meats and fatty fish, for sure  i don t do well with a lot of nuts, but i do okay with maybe a half cup of macadamia nuts per day  that s a pretty big amount of fat  so i can t think of any other fat sources  but you could pretty much fill the gap in calories with egg yolks and avocados and mct and especially if you re sourcing out fatty meats or poultry with the skin on it ''so damian matthews writes ''i listened but don t remember if you discussed metformin or methylene blue or other non food substances he s exploring for longevity ''methylene blue, i know a little bit about that, but i know a little bit more about metformin  so there s a couple interesting studies sort of ongoing being set up now  actually, the miles study, which stands for  metformin in longevity study,  is a pilot study to examine the effect of metformin treatment on the biology of aging in humans  it s really looking at how metformin can restore the gene expression profile of older adults with impaired   so older adults that tend to be impaired in glucose tolerance to that of young, healthy subjects  so how does metformin alter that gene expression profile? really interesting questions  we don t have answers yet  i know university of alabama is doing a multi year trial on metformin and longevity ''i think there s maybe a couple other studies that are being developed now that you might be able to find on clinicaltrials gov  so it does appear that metformin has a calorie restriction mimetic effect in regard to signaling  so it lowers blood glucose  it lowers insulin a little bit  it lowers glucose in those that have high blood glucose and in those that don t have elevated blood glucose, it lowers it, but not that much, very little  i found in myself and in others and i think in animal models it s showing this too   there s an elevation of ketones  i think that elevation in ketones is further enhanced if you re on a ketogenic diet ''suggesting that it may be enhancing fatty acid oxidation in the liver  metformin is a pretty powerful activator of amp kinase  it may lower mtor signaling, etc  all these things are things that calorie restriction do and we think that the benefits of calorie restriction are likely mediated by some of the things that i mentioned and undoubtedly there s many other things that are also happening  there was a study done in rats and it s important to acknowledge the type of strain because there s strain differences ''we realize this when we work with different animals  these were fischer 344 rats  there s a study showing metformin supplementation on the life span of this rat model  no significant life span extension was observed with metformin supplementation, at least at the dose that they used in the study ''i have to go back and look at the study  when we give metformin, some of the studies just inject metformin as like a metformin hydrochloride solution  i think it s important to mix it in with the food, and that s what we do with our study  so when the standardized dose, obviously from the scientist standpoint, it makes sense to just go in there with a syringe and give x amount of metformin interperitoneally or sub cue to all the animals so you know exactly how much you re going ''but the rodents pretty much eat the same amount of food, give or take a few grams every day  so we actually mix the metformin into the food so when the animals eat the food, they will get the metformin we think when they need it ''so the metformin helps to get a normalized blood glucose in response to a meal  i think other investigators may do injection of the metformin or they put it into the water  but we think it s important to give the metformin while you re giving calories that would increase blood glucose or insulin, so it helps to mitigate that effect  so in this rodent study, they saw no extension of life span with metformin  my concern with metformin is the side effects for long term use ''so i used it sort of in myself and i kind of like the effects of it  i think it generally has a little bit of a calming effect  above two grams start to give some gi discomfort  one of the side effects that i ve observed with metformin is that it caused, i guess you could call it a photo reaction or a photo dermatitis on my wrist ''why is it doing that? that s something i don t know  i ve kind of looked into it  so the dermis of both of my wrists are kind of messed up because i use lifting straps and in the past i ve handled a lot of weight with doing shrugs  i ve damaged the underlying dermis  that area would be eczema, which i did when i was following a high carb diet, it would occur in those areas  so those areas are just really sensitive areas in my body ''when i was on metformin and i think it may have accumulated in my system and i went outside, that those areas would be highly reactive to light and it would start to get hives in that area  so i stopped metformin and then i transitioned to berberine and that completely went away  metformin also has the issue that i had a lot of gi discomfort with metformin ''there s also some data to indicate that it could reduce the transport and utilization of b12  so you might want to supplement b12 with that  but when it comes to using metformin for longevity, i think the jury is still out  we need to look at that and it s something we actually may do in the lab in our aged animal model  but for longevity, the things that i do are the big things obviously are just strength training, muscle  the biggest factor of aging, the biggest consequence, i guess you d call it a pathological consequence of aging would be a loss of skeletal muscle  so the most important thing to do would be intense heavy weight training a minimum of twice a week to help preserve as much muscle as possible ''and things that enhance our mitochondrial health a vitality  that would be nutritional ketosis, intermittent fasting  i m not a big fan of endurance exercise, but i do go for walks a couple times a week  i would need to force myself to do this, but i think high intensity interval training done two or three times a week would be optimal for getting longevity effects  i just have not been able to get myself motivated to do high intensity interval training ''the next question comes from josh brackett ''does a ketogenic diet   can i use it for glycolytic training muay thai?''a question i get quite often  the combination of diet and training together produces an adaptation  so what you re really going for, yes, you can use a ketogenic diet for glycolytic training, but you have to train for that ''you have to do the training and follow the diet and over time, and time being like over three months, i m convinced that most people s metabolic physiology will adapt to a ketogenic diet with glycolytic training  we talk about maybe losing some of that quick firing of the type 2 fast twitch, low oxidative fibers, you want to keep that power, that strength  if you re supplementing with things like creatinine and if you re eating red meat, i think it may be a little more important if you re on a ketogenic diet to supplement with a good creatinine product  creatinine monohydrate would be fine  not all people will be able to adapt to the diet ''so i think that s kind of important, but i think most importantly, it s to give it an honest try, you ve got to give it about three to six months  you may just shift to a low carb for a while with some ketone supplementation and before you actually try a ketogenic diet  so that may be why short term ketogenic diet studies on performance show a decrease  there s a lot of the low carb studies out there that are  ketogenic   they just don t have the athletes follow the diet long enough to be sufficiently keto adapted to really get the benefits of the diet  so jeff volek in his faster study did athletes that had been adapted to a ketogenic diet for like a year or more  if you look at their fat oxidation rates during training, these are endurance and not glycolytic training, but they re burning roughly two times more fat ''that s preserving glycogen  so in the context of glycolytic training, if your body is fat adapted   and the athletes were burning considerably more fat just at rest  the practical advantage there is that you re preserving muscle glycogen for the event ''gerard e  dawson, iii, asks ''what is it like to be an academic who also makes serious weight training a big part of your life? how do these two pursuits complement or complicate each other?''that s a good question  they complement each other because the lessons that i learned from training, weight training over the years   the first book i read was arnold  the education of a bodybuilder ''i think i was 13 or 14 years old  that book probably saved me in some way because at the time, i was a horrible student  i just kind of did what i needed to do to get past in academia  when i was sitting in class, the only thing i wanted to do was leave class  all i could just do was think about getting home and just not being in school  so serious weight training at the time, which i did in my teen years, it really i guess groomed my mind and my body too for being resilient and kind of understanding that it really takes hard word to advance  because when i started training, i was making no progress at all ''it had to be hard training coupled with, fortified with a game plan  so i became what i would call an obsessive planner  i would carry this little book with me and write down specifically what i was going to do  i did that  i have training journal sitting in my office right now from when i was 14 years old and very detailed sets and reps  i can go back and look at each of those workouts and actually remember it  being downstairs in my parents  basement gym and remember it  i sort of parlayed that mindset of being very structured and disciplined from weight training  it took a couple years, but eventually by the time i was 17 or 18, i applied that to my academic pursuits ''i was more motivated to do so because the classes that i was taking were a little more challenging, like honors biology classes and things, where i was learning about diet  i was learning a little bit about nutrition  so in academia and for being a scientist, the sort of rigorous planning, note taking, self evaluation, being honest and critical of myself i think really helps out a lot  so if i m completely honest now though, i would not want to be as big and strong or as into lifting as i was when i was younger  so generally i think serious weight training when it comes to body building, power lifting, power lifting at a very elite level is kind of an unhealthy sport ''so my focus primarily as i ve been getting older is longevity  your priorities change when you get older  so it s not to be as big and strong as humanly possible, because that involves pretty much nonstop eating in my case  because i have kind of an ectomorphic body  so you re asking,  so how do the two pursuits complement one another or complicate one another?  complicate  so yeah, the pursuit of size and strength really contradicts what we want to go after for longevity ''for longevity, we want to pretty much eat the minimal amount of calories that we need to sustain, whereas surplus calories can lead to the activation of certain pathways and genes and igf 1 that could contribute to aging or an accelerated path to age related chronic diseases and maybe even cancer ''so there s that balance  so i want to maintain a lot of the strength that i have been able to accrue from my earlier years, but be able to do it in a way and maintain that size and strength without compromising my health  right now i m just kind of in a maintenance phase, but i still make training a priority regardless  no matter how busy things get in the lab, at work, with teaching, with travel, whatever  i make it a priority and i think it s important to be a lot more flexible in the way that you get your workouts in  so be creative  my time is much more limited ''so be able to do a workout on the fly  i remember we were actually on our way to asia, my wife and i  things are before you travel, you re just kind of bogged down with trying to get everything done two or three days out  i hadn t worked out for like three days at all  i was completely sort of immobile behind my desk  we were on the plane and it was a 17 hour flight  i had to get up and walk around and she got up too and we basically   i started doing squats with her on my back in the middle of the aisle ''these are things that i do now  i will do like pushups with her on my back  if i don t have access to a gym, i will go find a tree  if you re really motivated and it s part of who you are and what you do, there s no excuse that you can t fit in a workout ''daniel barichena asks ''your thoughts on john kiefer s carb night or carb back loading?''so carb back loading is actually really effective for gaining size and strength  i did that probably a lot in the early 2000s  it was something that i was already doing years ago  now i understand and appreciate the importance of titrating the levels of carbohydrate to the individuals  it shouldn t be an all you can eat free for all after your workout  i don t care how intense your workout is  that s not going to be optimal and it s going to be productive  so you want to prevent your postprandial glucose levels from getting too high  so you want to optimize your recovery, to optimize glycogen restoration ''you want to prevent your glucose levels from getting above say   for me, it s about 120 to 130  i find that if i do carb back loading, which i took a little bit of time out and tried it a year or two ago when i was getting a lot of questions on this  i could gradually sort of ramp up my carbs to about 350 after a hard workout  my glucose would start to climb to about 140, but i wanted to keep it below that and also the types of carbohydrates i consumed were pretty important too  but i think even a large individual, that was way too much, i think  i could get the same effect by 100 to 200 grams of carbs for carb back loading ''it s really important if you re going to do this on a daily basis or weekly or whatever, it s important to acknowledge all the negative things that can result from hitting your body with a massive glucose load  doing that immediately after you ve done a lot of damage to the body, where you ve stimulated the muscle in a way where you have a lot of breakdown, a lot of inflammation, if you throw a lot of glucose at it, the consequences are not going to be good ''we know that when your glucose level gets above 140 milligrams per deciliter, that can cause irreversible beta cell loss  so your beta cells are the cells that produce insulin  so if you routinely get your glucose levels above that, you essentially have beta cell burnout over time  so that s been shown  that s published  there s a couple articles you can find on that ''you can get potentially nerve damage with that sort of high glucose levels, especially in people that are a little more older and insulin resistance  the cancer rates increase if glucose spikes above, say 160 milligrams per deciliter over time  so if you re getting 160 milligrams per deciliter spikes in your glucose by doing these big re feeds, you could potentially increase your rates of cancer  stroke risk is increased by about 25 percent for every 1 millimolar rise in post meal blood sugars  so that has been documented  that s important  so that s 18 milligrams per deciliter for every rise  so you need to consider the health consequences to these big boluses of sugar ''so i ve used this approach and i think it produces good results  like i said, for me, i m over 100 kilograms and i didn t find that i need any more than 100 to 200 grams of carbohydrates post workout  any more than that and what happens is that you just tend to spill over  you just hold a lot of water after  you re not effectively storing the glucose as glycogen  it just gets into your   it just spills over  so a slow carb approach to back loading is probably the best approach  so if you do this, slowly add the carbohydrates in and do lower glycemic carbohydrates to do that ''the last question i d like to address is that about the safety of ketone cell products on the market  specifically, the dl beta hydroxybuterate salts that are part of the kegenix product,  inaudible , ketosports, ketocana, forever green sells ketopia  these are all products that i ve used and i like  there was a podcast, dave asprey and ben greenfield had dr  veech on and he talked about the potential dangers of the dl beta hydroxybuterate salts and even about acetoacetate  so our no  1 concern when we do research is safety ''so the fda really decides what s safe as it moves to market and not us  we screen all forms of exogenous ketones in our lab, including the d beta hydroxybuterate, the racemic compounds and acetoacetate esters ''so it happened to be dr  brunengraber s ester he developed at case western that we used for our cns oxygen toxicity seizure studies because beta hydroxybuterate esters are the d and the  inaudible  of beta hydroxybuterate did not work  whereas, the brunengraber ester elevated both beta hydroxybuterate and acetoacetate  so dr  veech s opinion is at the dl beta hydroxybuterate because it s racemic, it has a lot of potential problems regarding safety ''specifically, that racemic compounds have a lot of inherent dangers in using them  it s important to note that many drugs on the market are racemic  that would include things like adderall, ephedrine hydrochloride and pseudo ephedrine ''ibuprofen is racemic  these things are proven safe  beta hydroxybuterate actually has a naturally occurring isomerase for the inner conversion from the l to the d form  there s a mountain of studies that clearly show that dl beta hydroxybuterate suppresses seizures, inhibits cancer, suppresses reactive oxygen species, oxidative stress, protects the liver, promotes wound healing, reduces inflammation, protects against hypoglycemia and stroke, is protective against leukodystrophy and a number of rare disorders  so i m just kind of looking through all the publications i have in my file here  these effects would not be observed if dl beta hydroxybuterate was dangerous or ineffective, which was proposed and discussed on the podcast ''you also need to consider that approximately 10 million doses of dl beta hydroxybuterate salts have been consumed worldwide from the prove it product to forever green to ketocana sells quite well and at least 10 million doses, i believe, have been sold  there s little, if any, i don t think any adverse medical side effects have been reported with this  just besides diarrhea and loose stools if the dosing gets too high  i know some individuals that are dosing really high  if the dl beta hydroxybuterate was toxic, it would have been reported by all these people using it and also it would be reported in the medical literature to treat a variety of different medical conditions ''keep in mind that they re using the pure sodium beta hydroxybuterate, which there s a lot of discussion about sodium being dangerous  we don t think that s the case if it s kept at a particular level  anything is toxic if it gets too high  but it s also pretty important to balance out beta hydroxybuterate and to spread it across various minerals so to have a beta hydroxybuterate salt product that has potassium, calcium, magnesium and sodium together would be ideal ''i ve really gotten hundreds of emails from people that have given me tremendous feedback on the ketone salts  feedback on performance and feedback for the therapeutic use of ketone salts  i don t advise using ketone salts for therapeutic purposes because clinical trials need to be done ''but that does not stop people from using them and parents reporting back that their child is not able to achieve nutritional ketosis and getting many benefits from it ''so i think i ve taken up a lot of time here and we ve covered a lot of ground, probably more ground than we needed to  i ve enjoyed looking through all these questions  i haven t looked through all of them yet, but i looked through about 80 percent of them, i think  they re excellent questions  thank you for listening and i look forward to maybe being on again and handling more '"
36,37,37: Tony Robbins ,"   hello, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls  this is a very exhausted tim ferriss, and welcome to the tim ferriss show  so glad to have you  i am one tired son of a bitch right now, and i couldn't be happier about it because i have been flying around the country doing various experiments, and i had the opportunity to go to palm beach, florida to sit at the home of tony robbins and ask him just about everything i've ever wanted to ask him  and this is a very special interview for me  this is the interview, the conversation, i've wanted to have for 15 years  and now that i'm back in sf gathering myself, drinking some, what appears to be laughing coyote tea  i have no idea what's in it  it could be all sorts of drugs  and i'm thrilled to be putting this out there for you because tony is a fascinating character  for those of you who don't know him, he has consulted or advised leaders including nelson mandela, mikhail gorbachev, margaret thatcher, and mother teresa  he's consulted members of two royal families, us congress, us army, us marines, three us presidents, including clinton  and other celebrity clients would include names you know like serena williams, andre agassi, greg norman, of course the golf legend, leonardo dicaprio, and oprah winfrey, who calls him superhuman  the stat that always just sends my head spinning is that tony has developed and produced five award winning infomercials  that's of course how a lot of people came to know of him  and these infomercials have continuously aired on average every 30 minutes 24 hours a day somewhere in north america since, check it out, april 1989  it's just tony tv out there 24 7, insanity  this particular conversation is broken into basically three parts  the first third of our very long conversation involves me asking him the questions i've always been dying to ask him ever since i first was exposed to his material  and i explain a lot of the background, which is kind of hilarious, when we get started  the second third and the third third would  and of course, along the way we talk about his daily routines, the types of questions that he asks world class performers and so on     copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    the latter portions of this focus on what tony has been researching and really teasing apart and analyzing for the last    well several decades but especially the last four years, and that is, ""how do you master the game of money? why is there so much financial illiteracy, and how do you stack the deck so that you can win?"" because there's a lot of hi jinx, and there's a lot of nonsense out there  how do you actually invest? what do you do with your money? and it's a huge topic, but he has interviewed, and in fact, coached some of the most unbelievable minds in the world of finance and investing  i couldn't believe the list, including people like paul tudor jones, ray dalio, who is of course a wiz in the world of hedge funds  and the list is unbelievable  carl icahn, david swensen, who turned  1 billion into    i think   23 billion for yale    some curious characters like mark dr  doom favor, sir john templeton, kyle bass, who became very very famous for in effect, predicting and shorting the sub prime crisis  or at least, he made one of his fortunes in seeing that through the looking glass  these are the navy seals, the top of the top, and he's been able to ask them just about everything that you would want to ask them  and a lot of what tony is going to say is controversial or counter intuitive  no doubt you'll disagree with some of what he says  but i guarantee you even if you don't care about investing or you think you don't care about investing    and by the way, if you've decided not to think about investing, that is a decision in investing  i guarantee that if you listen to this entire conversation, which i plan to listen to over and over again    it has a lot of information  that you will take away at least one or two things from tony that lead you to say, ""holy shit  i've never looked at that aspect of my life that way "" and it will turn things upside down, and you will walk away with a completely different lens through which you can look at how you're living, how you're handling your business, and i think you will find tremendous value from this single interview  so i will leave it at that  i don't want to oversell it  i will say that for me, tony can be an intimidating guy just in sheer size  he's a big dude  and he can actually palm my entire face, and we have a photograph of that that i'll share when i get in the interview  he's also a very seasoned pro, and i have a lot of respect for him  so it takes me five or ten minutes    i'd say    yeah, let's just say ten minutes    to find my feet in this interview  when we hit our stride, then all sorts of gems come out  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and there's a lot of good material in the beginning, but give it some time  be patient  listen to this whole thing  it is worth your time  so without further ado, i think i've had too much laughing coyote tea  here's tony robbins  alright ladies and gentlemen, this is tim ferriss  welcome to another episode of the tim ferriss show  i have a very exciting episode for you and a very exciting guest, mr  tony robbins  tony, thank you for having me in your home of all places  tony robbins   i'm glad to be home  that's a rare thing, much less to have you here    thankful to have you here as well   tim ferriss   and we have many different topics  i have many different questions i'd love to delve into  of course, i    perhaps unbeknownst to a lot of my fans    have a long history with tony robbins but not in person  this is the first, and for those of you who don't know some of the background, when i first graduated from school and moved to silicon valley to chase the billions that seemed just    they were being handed out in '99   tony robbins   they were in 1999   tim ferriss   in 1999, they were in a way  and i was driving a hand me down beat up green minivan from my mom  the seats got stolen from inside    at least the back, so all of my co workers started harassing me and calling it the ""molester mobile "" and the job, the company, didn't seem to be a long term fit for me, and when i was on a road trip at one point, i bought personal power  it may have been personal power 2  and i started listening to it to and from work on my commute, which is terrible for those who don't know the bay area  if you're on 101 between san jose and sf, it's horrible  and ultimately, that was one of the catalysts for me starting my first company   tony robbins   wow! i'm really touched that    knowing all that you've done, that really touches me completely because you've been an inspiring character to me    not for four hour work week because i'm looking for the 4 hour sleep work at this stage  i'd like to be able to pull that one off  but really, i think the way you attack subjects    and that's what you do  you don't look at them  you go after a mastery of them  and the way you experiment, and the way you constantly dig underneath to find the organizing principles, i feel a kinship with you    we're in different stages of life and things like that, but i have enormous respect for you   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and i don't feel that way about everybody  i like everybody, but i don't respect everybody  you deserve the respect because you go deep  most people are    really they're surface level in what they do  so i'm excited to chat with you and see what can come out of this conversation  tim ferriss   thank you for sure  and i have, of course, a bunch of selfinterested questions that i think will also be interesting to other folks hopefully  but what's always impressed me about your entire career and the results that you ve achieved is how far you ve been able to take it in terms of working with    say the top 1  of performers in the world  and i read in your new book, which everyone should take a look at  we'll be delving into it a lot more as we progress in the interview  but there was a quote from mr  benioff of salesforce who credits you with    effectively if there were no tony robbins, there would be no salesforce com   tony robbins   that's a pretty big claim to make  i think he might have told me he exaggerated  but he kind of walked me through because it started very much like you, him on the freeway in silicon valley every day listening   tim ferriss   and you get these    you're able to reach such a high caliber of individual  when you meet with such people, whether they're presidents, athletes like serena williams, agassi, actors like hugh jackman, whoever it might be, benioff's quote was, ""tony said to me that the quality of my life was the quality of my questions "" so what i would be curious to know is when you meet with these top performers, where do you start? what are the questions that you ask them?  tony robbins   well, i ask questions before i meet them  the question i want to ask before i meet them is, ""who are they? what are they made of? what are they after? what's preventing them from getting it? where are their wounds? what is their deepest pride?"" not in a negative way, like what are they proud of  i try to find as much as i can in advance so that i can be really effective and efficient when i meet them  when you meet somebody    yourself myself, the most valuable thing we have is our time  so i try to be beyond respectful of that, but also i load my brain with all the distinctions i can so that when i enter in to an interaction with someone and we're engaged, i have a disproportionate amount of information, ideas, insights, wisdom available to me  and then i can react to what's really happening in this moment  so  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    i have what i think in advance, and i have what the moment shows me  and i think the blend of that is really valuable because in the moment, people can show up in all kinds of ways  somebody could show up    the meanest person on earth can be kind in the moment  the kindest person can be very mean in the moment  so i really like to grab both those  and then what i want to do when i meet them is i want to try and understand what is it that they really need, not only what they want  because what you want    i'm sure you've experienced this  i have in my life    gotten what you want  and then you're like, ""is that what it is?"" it's like, ""what the hell?"" because what really makes us fulfilled as human beings is what we need  and there's only so many needs, so i dig under what the needs are  i look at, 'what's their model of the world? how do they approach meeting those needs?"" and every model has limitations and challenges, mine, yours, anybody's  and so that tells me before i even meet them where the real challenge is, and then i listen for what the surface challenge is  and my goal is solve the surface challenge, but also give them more than they bargained for, solve the deeper challenge  and ultimately, my goal is that they have a greater quality of life  and most people i work with have an extraordinary quality of life  they may not realize it  they may have forgotten it and lost track of it unless i'm dealing with somebody    which i also deal with  who's coming back from afghanistan with ptsd, and they got light sensitivity  they can't sleep at night  they wake up in cold sweats, and they're shaking while they're talking to me  that's a different game  boom, that's something that's got to be dealt with in a different way  but when you're talking about peaked performers, their challenges are usually they're hungry for me  right, that's the nature    probably people listening to this, they're going to listen tim ferriss  they're listening for more  give me something beyond what everybody else is talking about, and you're always seeking to try and find that by not limiting it to yourself, same as myself  let's go find whoever is best in these areas, and let's pull it together  and let's find the organizing principles that codify this  so i'm looking to figure out what is that more that they want, or what is it that's stopping them  and then i go into the experience and just absorb what's there  and the combination of the two is how i'm able usually to get pretty extraordinary results  but without the prep    what most people don't know me is the level of prep i do   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    like i can get up and with my pinky do six days in a row without a note or anything of that nature at this stage  that's not intelligence  that's experience  that's the 40,000 hours, not 10,000 hours over the years  but i still prep because what i do is i activate in my nervous system that knowledge base of what i want to be able to serve somebody with  i try to bring that to the surface, so it's readily available  it's the difference between emotional intelligence and what i call emotional fitness  emotional intelligence is the capability to deliver something  fitness is the readiness to be able to make that happen  so i'm more interested in being emotionally fit or being emotionally fit for that person in the moment  tim ferriss   and when you    when you interact with people    for instance, paul tudor jones, legendary investor and trader, or agassi or anyone who is at the peak of their game and suddenly enters a slump, what are the commonalities, if any, that you've spotted in the best of the best who then cease for a period of time being the best of the best? what triggers that type of downslope?  tony robbins   well, everybody has got different triggers  there's some common patterns  one pattern is doing so well that you go beyond your vision, and it's the astronaut syndrome  what do you do when you're 31 years old, you've flew to the top of the mountain, you literally looked back at the earth and saw the picture we've all seen photographed, come back, shake the president's hand, have the ticker tape parade  okay, now what do you do with the rest of your life? and so most of those astronauts, if you know their histories, they went through some really tough times  some were alcoholics, some got addicted to prescription drugs  and so in some cases, that's why i enter people's world is they've done so well    they've called the market almost hour by hour or a week in advance, and they made more money in a day than most people have ever dreamed of when everybody else lost their shirt  and everybody wants to know what to do  okay, i've done that  now what do i do after i've called the market during the worst day in history? most people lose momentum then because they get distracted because it's like we need something to go for  we all need, what i call, a compelling future, something that will get us up early, keep us late and excite us, at least the nature of a high performer  and if you don t have that, life feels very dead for those people  and so president of the united states, i remember bill clinton saying to me    i was with him in aspen    i was there at a  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    fundraiser, and he asked me to come visit him  and he threw in the car and said, ""come down the hill with me "" it was one of those serene moments, lights are flashing    we're coming down red mountain in aspen, if you know the area  and he's sitting across from me right after the blue dress incident had come out  and he said, ""tony, it's just like i'm still so young  what am i going to do when i leave? what am i going to do in my 50's?"" i said, ""if i were you, i'd get the hell out quick "" because he's talking about, ""i'd run a third time if i could"" and i was teasing him about it  but he found a compelling future, and bill clinton today has something even greater in his life that he's going for  so the slump shows when people outrun their vision, or the slump can show when they meet their vision but it's not fulfilling  or the slump shows when people just end up developing some patterns they're unaware of that cost them  and it can be such a small thing with an athlete than can occur  and sometimes it shows like a tiger woods when something happens in their emotional life  and while they try to say, ""i'm an athlete here, and i'm a human being over there"" they don't separate  and so what i got to do in those situations regardless of what triggered it is i've got to come in and get them to re anchor in their nervous system what made them so effective  and you understand myelin, the idea that the more you do something, the more you wire yourself  it's like myelin, the white portion of the brain    it's almost like using    if i do something over and over again, i literally wire myself with this myelin  it's like having high speed cable in there or whatever the appropriate    i don't know what it is anymore, what high speed really is these days, the proper term    but versus having dial up  if you do something over and over again, you can process so much more rapidly  so i will find    where is that myelin in that person? what specific pattern will hook that back up again to that part of their brain where it's effortless, to that brain where they instinct, and they don't even think  andre agassi was decades and decades ago    he's been no  1 in the world, and all of a sudden, he dropped to no  90 or something at that stage, like 90, 91, 92, whatever it was  and nothing worked because he kept working on his swing, and he kept working on his wrist  and he was really upset with his father who was his coach  there was all these dynamics going  nobody wants to talk about    he was actually to the point later on that he copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    was thinking about quitting playing the game    this was early in his career  and he's gotten injured  and andre is very frustrated, and brooke shields brought him to me  they were just dating at that time  and he said, ""i don't need positive thinking "" and she said, ""you know what? tony is not positive thinking  he's going to show you these strategies "" so he comes to me  i sit down with him  and i said, ""andre""    he's telling me about how he's doing this  i said, ""think about the time you hit a tennis ball perfectly "" i said, ""don't think about it  go to it "" i got him in state, got him kind of in that place where the myelin is being fired off  and then i said to him, ""okay, you feel that? you feel that?"" i go, ""were you thinking about your wrist?"" he says, ""no "" i said, ""then how the hell would you think you'd ever get back to that peak performance focusing on your wrist?"" so i've got to get them back into the pattern that made it work  and then oftentimes i've got to help them resolve some other issue that's distracting them, that is something else in their life that's pulling them apart from peak performance  tim ferriss   his story is an amazing one  open, the autobiography is one of the best     tony robbins   isn't it wild?  tim ferriss   i've ever read   tony robbins   yeah, it's wild   tim ferriss   it's such a fantastic book  so looking at the longevity of your career, the scope and scale of the tony robbins empire, so to speak, your endurance has really impressed me  and so i'm wondering after these decades, what are some of your daily routines? for instance, what do you typically eat for breakfast if it's up to you?  tony robbins   yeah, i have salad and fish  it's like standard  i'm boring as hell  because i just know it's fuel  now before i met my wife    we've been together more than 15 years, i was completely anal  i was  like i hadn't had chocolate, i hadn't had ice cream in like 15 years  it was just crazy  and then she came into my life, and i thought, ""god, this woman is incredible  she's a phlebotomist  she does the blood  she's an acupuncturist  she's a nutritionist "" we're having these green drinks  we have this lunch, and afterwards, she  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    ordered a hot fudge sundae  and i thought, ""what in the hell are you doing?"" she goes, ""living you bastard "" so she loosened my ass up, which was great because i loved her  so she calls it zigging and zagging  we zig zig zig, and then she zags or we zag  and when i was first with her, i was like    we were travelling through europe, rome and italy and various parts of the south of france  and i was like, ""you seem to be zagging every day "" and she goes, ""well, i'm on vacation "" and then later on, we were travelling  i said, ""you know what the problem is? we're always travelling, so you're always on vacation "" but she's thin as hell in great shape  but i'm fish and salad  i'm high greens, protein type of guy, very low carbs  but my regimen is i start with something to strengthen and jolt my nervous system  every freaking day, i will sometimes ease into it  i'll go in the hot pools, and i'm fortunate to have multiple homes  my home in sun valley, i have natural hot pools that come out of the ground just steaming hot  and i go in the hot pools, and then i go there in the river  here, i go in a 57 degree plunge pool that i have, and every home i have, every one  tim ferriss   and this would be immediately upon waking up?  tony robbins   waking up because it's just like boom, every cell in the body wakes up  and it's also just like training my nervous system to rock  there is no    i don't give a shit how you feel  this is how you perform  this is what you do  even when i'm taking vacation, i do it  i don't know  now i like it  it's a    i like that simple discipline that reminds me the level of strength and intensity that's available at any moment  even if i'm relaxing, i can bring that up at will  it's myelin  and i also have a cryotherapy unit in all my homes  have you tried cryotherapy?  tim ferriss   i haven't   tony robbins   do you know what it is?  tim ferriss   maybe you could help  i can put the two words together and probably guess   tony robbins   oh my god  with all that you do, you're going to love this  i'm glad i'm teaching tim ferriss for the first time   tim ferriss   i've done ice bath, not the first one   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tony robbins   ice baths suck  ice baths suck, trust me  i'm on stage on the weekend  i do my unleashed power program  it's three days, 50 hours  you got to come as my guest to an event sometime   tim ferriss   i would love to   tony robbins   but i'm going to give you an idea  people won't sit through a three hour movie that somebody spent  300 million on, and i got like usher or oprah going on, ""tony, i love you  but two hours is the most i can do "" and twelve hours later, oprah is standing on her chair going, ""this is the most incredible experience in my life"" on camera  and usher is like, ""dude, i'm in for all three days "" but for me, one of those days alone    i wear odometer fitbit, and it's 26 5 miles on average  we start at 8 30 in the morning  i finish at 1 30 or 2 00  there's one one hour break  people can vote with their feet  no one leaves  there's on average 20 minutes of just crazy ass standing ovations, music, stuff that happens at the end because people are just    it's like a rock concert  it's so much fun  but the wear and tear of doing basically marathon after marathon on the weekend back to back is pretty intense  and so over the years, the inflammation in my body, the demands, i've had to do everything i can to reduce it  nothing has come close to cryotherapy  cryotherapy was developed in poland and eastern germany in the eastern bloc countries  and what it does is it uses nitrogen, so there's no water unlike an ice bath which you do    you get spasms, and you got to do them still if you're a boxer, a runner, an athlete, which is what i would do before    hated them  there's none of that process, but it reduces your body temperature to minus 220 fahrenheit  and you do it three minutes, and it's mind boggling  in fact, i have one here, and i'll throw you in at the end if you want to get the experience   tim ferriss   i would love to  that'd be great   tony robbins   i have a unit here  i'll do it for you  but what it does is    and i do it about three times a week usually, and when i come back from an event, i do it a couple days in a row    and what it does is it takes all the inflammation out of your body  and you know what inflammation to every aspect of the body in the breakdown  but it also    it sends and merges signals to your brain, so you're resetting your neurological system because your brain is going, ""you're going to freeze to death "" it sound horrific  it really isn't  you'll  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    find out it's not that painful  going in my pain plunge, 57 degrees feels more jolting than this does even though it's colder because the fluid of water versus the nitrogen around you is different  tim ferriss   right, the conductivity   tony robbins   the conductivity  exactly right  so what happens is your nervous system gets these signals  so it's like everything in your body connects because it's like an emergency  every part    it's a reset of your nervous system  you get an explosion of endorphins in your body, which is really cool  so you get this natural high  you feel this physiological transformation, and you get the reduction of inflammation  what it was used for originally is for people with arthritis  and i found my first one because my mother in law would be calling up, and she was just crying in pain  and no medication was enough for her  and i hate somebody medicated anyway  and so i started to do all this research, and it just started to come to the us, and now the la lakers, most football teams    it's spreading like wildfire amongst the sports teams, and so that's where it took off  and so i went and got her one, and it took her  i think three sessions, and she's out of pain  and now, there's not a day she's in pain  now most people can't afford to go buy a unit, but there are local places now that are popping up all over the united states where athletes go, where people go for rejuvenation  and it's amazing for the skin  but it is one of the greatest things  i got it for her, so i got it for me  and now i'm addicted  so i've got one    and three minutes   tim ferriss   what type of unit? do you know the actual model and brand that you use?  tony robbins   yeah, there's two of them that are the best out there  was it java? junka    j u n k a i think it is  i'll get it for you when we go downstairs   tim ferriss   and i'll put it in the show notes for those of you who want   tony robbins   yeah, for everybody that wants to do it  but like if you're in la, there's a place on    i'll give it to you to put in your notes  a couple of the locations there, there's some great guys  i'm getting another unit  this is a brand new home, and i'm building an additional guesthouse and an additional site  this one, it just goes up to your neck  but i m getting one that encloses a full room, and  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    the reason is about 70  of your nervous receptors are from the neck up  so when you step into one of those, it's even more powerful  but other than that, i don't do that much different with my life  tim ferriss   i don't believe that entirely  i'll keep digging  but you have the either    the sort of contrast there being the hot cold, the cryotherapy    you have salad and fish  how far after    if you were to kind of spec out the first hour of your day   tony robbins   well, the first    every day, i do the water  i take in the environment, and then the first thing i do before i do anything else in my day is i do what i call priming  and priming to me is different than meditating  i'm never really a meditator per se    i know the value of it  but the idea for me of sitting still and having no thoughts just didn't really work out for me  it was just a pain in the ass, and i just thought that's not natural  and it's like that's why it works  but when i'm in nature, i feel that form of meditation  when i stand on stage and someone stands up, in my brain, it's done  i don't even know what it is, but person is suicidal    i've never lost a suicidal in 37 years  knock on wood, doesn't mean i won't someday  but i never have out of thousands, and we followed up with them  so it's like there's something that comes through me, and it's quite meditative  it's like i experience it as a witness  and afterwards, it's one of the most beautiful gifts in my life  so i know that meditation  but for me, priming is if you want to have a prime life, you've got to be in a prime state  and weeds grow automatically  i don't give a damn what it is  and my teacher jim rohn used to say that  and so what i do is i get up, and i do a very simple process  i do an explosive change in my physiology  i've done the water already  right? cold hot  then i do it with breath  i know you know all forms of eastern meditation  all understand that the mind is the kite and breath is the string  so if i want to move that kite, i move the breath  so i have a specific pattern of breathing that i do  i do 30 of these breaths, and i do them at three sets of 30  and that creates a profound physiological difference in my body  and from that altered state, i usually listen to some music  and i go for    i usually promise myself ten minutes, and i usually go 30   tim ferriss   and you do that in this room that we're sitting in?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tony robbins   no, i do it all up this one  it's where i do it  this has got a great vibe  i'll do this one  i'll do it at night  i usually will go outside because i love the wind on my face, and i love taking the elements and so forth  but i do it multiple places  i'm on the road    it doesn't matter what day  i do not miss priming  the reason is  you don't get fit by being lucky  you don't get fit by working out for a weekend  you know    you live your life that way  fitness is because it becomes just part of who you are  so what i do during that time is i do three simple times, and i do it minimum of ten minutes  three minutes of just me feeling back inside my body and outside my head, feeling the earth and my body and the experience, and then feeling totally grateful for three things  and i make sure that one of them is very very simple, the wind on my face, the reflection of the clouds that i just saw there  but i don't just think gratitude  it's like i let gratitude fill my soul because when you're grateful, we all know there's no anger  it's possibly anger and grateful simultaneously  when you're grateful, there is no fear  you can't be fearful and grateful simultaneously  so i think it is one of the most important power emotions of life, and to me, there s nothing worse than an angry rich man or woman, somebody who's got everything  and they're pissed off  i want to slap them   tim ferriss   surprisingly, high numbers though   tony robbins   it is because they develop a life that's based on expectation instead of appreciation   tim ferriss   agreed   tony robbins   and i tell people, ""you want to change your life fast? then trade your expectation for appreciation, and you'll have a whole new life "" so every day, i anchor that in, and i do it very deeply and emotionally  then the second three minutes that i do is a total focus on feeling presence of god, if you will, however you want to language that for yourself, but this inner presence coming in and feeling it heals everything in my body, in my mind, my emotions, my relationships, my finances  i see it as solving anything the strengthening of my conviction, of my passion  spontaneously  and then i  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved   that needs to be solved  i experience gratitude, of my strength, of my and i just let those things happen focus on celebration and then service   because my whole life is about service  that's what makes me feel alive  so i flood myself with that with a breathing pattern that i take that does the opposite, that takes it down through my body and back up again  and then the last three minutes are me focusing on three things that i'm going to happen, my three to thrive  and i have some big things that i'll do, and sometimes i'll do things that are smaller  but i see them, feel them, experience them  so it's a really simplistic process, ten minutes  but i come out of it in my power  it doesn't matter if i had two hour sleep  i'm now ready  and i do this even when i have no sleep  that's how committed i am  and as i've always said, there's no excuse not to do ten minutes  if you don't have ten minutes, you don't have a life  that's how i got myself to do it  and now that i've done it, 20 to 30 minutes is almost always what it is because it actually feels extraordinary  tim ferriss   and where can people learn more about the breathing pattern? or could you describe it briefly?  tony robbins   i'm putting a link online because i just started to share this just recently  and i'll get it for you  i don't know what it is off the top of my head, but i'll get it shortly    i think this week   tim ferriss   okay, awesome  and i will also put that in the show notes guys  so that's just fourhourworkweek com podcast  you'll be able to find this episode  on the    i have to ask    what type of music do you listen to during that ?  tony robbins   i have a variety  but for that meditation, i have one in particular, which is a one ness meditation that a friend of mine made it who's from india that i find really profound  there's no singing in it or anything like that  it's just the sound of a vibration that's going on, and i just love it  but that's what i'm doing currently  in the past over the years, i've used all kinds of different peace music  but i don't use modern music or pop music or rock    i mean, i do that to work out, rap    i don't know    it just feels weird to be doing rap while you're meditating  but again, i don't look at it as meditation because i look at it as it's priming courage, love, joy    it's priming gratitude    it's priming strength    it's priming accomplishment  it's priming    when i m doing my gratitude peace, i'm doing the circle of who's closest to me and circling that out to everybody i love and sending that energy and healing out to them as well  so to me, if you want  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    primetime life, you've got to prime daily  tim ferriss   well, i like the term priming also because i think most people who struggle with meditation or even attempt to use meditation are using it for that purpose  they're doing it in the morning  and when you said, ""if you don't have ten minutes, you don't have a life,"" it reminded me of something that russell simmons said to me, which was, ""if you don't have 30 minutes to meditate, you need three hours "" and i don't always do 30 minutes, and i do meditate in the morning  and it's been a very consistent pattern throughout all the people that i've interviewed so far on the podcast   tony robbins   really?  tim ferriss   practically 100    tony robbins   wow, that's wonderful   tim ferriss   and of course, we'll get to ray dalio, but also very avid meditator   tony robbins   yes  he's coming with me to india in a couple weeks   tim ferriss   well, that will be an amazing trip, i'm sure   tony robbins    for a week of this experience   tim ferriss   amazing  so when people hear the name tony robbins, i think many different people have different assumptions or images in their head  what are the biggest conceptions or the biggest misconception about you?  tony robbins   oh my god  there's so many    when you've been in the culture at any level for any period of time, people put their projections out to what you are  and then also, i didn't help myself  i did infomercials for a period of time  but i didn't want to do infomercials  it was just i had these insights and skillsets  but if i was a great singer    which i'm clearly not    there was a distribution channel  i could do that  and if i was bullshitting myself, i could rock the world  but in my world, it was write a book, which most people don't read, go do some speeches  so i looked around and saw these silly ass infomercials  and i said, ""these guys are a disaster "" tommy voux, come be on my boat and watch me get these women  and i'm rich  and i'm like, ""oh my god  it's  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    disgusting "" so what if you did something that was real, and the kind of people i reach, i don't have to pay for endorsements  they'll do it  maybe people start to understand this is real, and it did  it got me bill clinton  it got me princess diana  it got me a pretty amazing group of people at that stage  but also, you're known by the company you keep  so when you're between spray on hair, whatever fake diamondstim ferriss   rotisserie chicken   tony robbins   then you're seen as that  and also i talk fast  i'm a passionate son of a bitch  and so i'm not talking fast because i'm trying to sell something  i'm talking fast because my brain functions at that speed  that's just how my brain goes  slowing it down is just so boring to me  the faster i go, the stronger my brain becomes, the quicker i come to solutions  so when i'm most excited and want to serve people, it speeds up  so that helps when you've got a room of people where you can move and modulate that energy  but when you're seeing somebody on tv, and they look like they're a crazy son of a bitch, and they're 6'7, and they've got hands bigger than your head, you start going, ""who is this guy?"" the people that have actually    like yourself or mark benioff or president clinton or whoever who've actually entered into my work, once they enter into my work, they go, ""oh my god  this is very different "" so i think most people think i'm an infomercial guy or a salesman or a motivator    i hate the word motivator  it is the bane of my existence because i've never been that  i've never   i don't believe you should just go pump yourself up  i believe in intelligence  i believe    see things as they are  if you can't see as they are, you can't lead  but don't see it worse than it is so you've got an excuse not to try  that's what most people do  they make it much worse than it is because they're afraid of failing, so they come up with a reason why    a story why it's there  and i don't tolerate that shit  i'm not the guy that says, ""there's no weeds  there's no weeds "" i'm the guy who goes, ""let me show you where the god damn weeds are, and let's pull these son of a bitches out right now and stop bullshitting  let's do it  you and i, i'll do it with you "" that's my approach  i think most people think it's a pump up approach because the media sees 10,000 people in a room, and they're jumping up and down  and what is this piece? that's because i believe that learning    i believe what i do for people and its essence is ecube them   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    ecube is i entertain them first because people in our society want to be educated, but they'd much rather be entertained  so if i can rock you and get you to have an experience where you feel fully alive, then    and it doesn't matter who you are  you're from any stage of life, any socioeconomic background, then i'm going to be able to have your education go deeper  and so then that's the second part  i give you the best education, the best tools  and the third one is i empower you  while you're in this state, i get you to do things that you won't forget  two things that will be in your body, do things that create momentum  so i think the misconception    at least my perception    is they don't realize who is a strategist    i mean, i consider you a strategist  and i know you're inspirational and everything else, but being inspiring is nice  motivation, there's nothing wrong with it  it's like warm baths  you should take one or you stink  but that's enough, and it's never been what i've been about  but most people in our society are interesting, it's like if you're looking to improve yourself, people in our world think that's natural  the average person is like, ""what's wrong with you?"" i remember i took a company public when i was 39 years old, had a really wonderful hit    400 million bucks  it was extraordinary  and the man who ran my company had been the former ceo of cbs, brilliant guy, brilliant guy, peter  and peter, at one point when we're in the midst of this company, he said, ""i want to go to harvard, and i want to take this extension course "" very wealthy guy    handled the largest network in the world, and now heading up my company  and i remember three or four people like, ""what's the matter? why's he doing that? has he lost his edge?"" versus life is growth baby  if you don't keep growing, you're going to die  but some people are afraid of the unknown  they're afraid of i'm not looking good    i'm afraid to fail  but so that creates a challenge  but i think the answer to your question is they don't know that i'm a strategist, they don't know how much i really care    they have no clue the depth of what i teach or the diversity of what i teach, subjects your body, your mind, your emotions, relationships, your finances  they don't know the real impact, or they don't know who i really work with  the assumption is, ""he's taking over weak people's minds and pumping them up and giving them all this enthusiasm "" tim ferriss   casting spells on them?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tony robbins   i mean, that's crazy shit  but i'm not here to try to dispel that  what i try to do is the reason i'm still here is the more people you touch, the more you reach, i don't have to do that  the people that have been to my events are the greatest people to balance that out  and social media has been really wonderful because people say, ""this is what this guy is "" and 12 other people go, ""you've never had an experience  let me tell you what this really is about "" and that's really been a wonderful    an enhancement to my ability to reach people, social media   tim ferriss   just to reiterate something you said about inspiration being necessary but not sufficient, i think that like you having the label of sort of motivation or motivational speaker applied to what i try to do is very frustrating because one of the things that differentiates   tony robbins   they put that label on you too?  tim ferriss   oh, yeah   tony robbins   i didn't know that   tim ferriss   it's just an easy label to throw around   tony robbins   i know  it's like what else you going to call it   tim ferriss   it's like i'm not going to read the books, so i may as well find a label that i can understand  and i was going to say you had an infomercial, but at least you weren't selling the four hour work week on those infomercials  you'd have twice the level of hell that you already get   tony robbins   that s funny   tim ferriss   but the difference in your material because    i really wanted to better myself when i was hitting some very rough spots in my first year out of school  and the difference between say personal power and a lot of your other material including the new book on money and finance and investing, which you guys at some point, i'll try to share some of it with you  but i have    i would say  probably 20 to 30 printed pages of notes in evernote just on    i still have about 50 pages left, but it's a big book  we'll get to that  i felt like giving you a pat on the back  it's like, ""oh, another 600 page book  i know how these go ""  tony robbins   build your biceps with this baby   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   but you give very tactical next steps at the proper time  so you do sugar coat the medicine a bit by capturing people's attention  and not to make this glen gary glenn ross aida, but you have to have those elements in the proper sequence or you can't elicit action from people  and that's something that you've had huge  you've been very influential on my teaching, which is how i would view my writing, because of that model  and so if you look at    say the four hour work week is one instance  the reason that i have these comfort challenges at the end of each chapter is because i know i'm going to have big asks later, and i want to condition people to take action  and i think that your materials, it's some of the best in the world i've ever seen   tony robbins   thank you for that  i want to say something about what you said because it's very important  i mean, you are one of the few people i've heard actually notice it, and i've noticed it in your work  and i didn't know it was influenced by me in any way, and i'm complimented by that  but i think you probably just got there on your own just by thinking  the dog bit johnny  johnny bit the dog  same exact words, different syntax, totally different experience, especially if you're johnny  and people don't realize that sometimes when they think, ""i'm 30 pounds overweight and i'll never get this  i've tried everything  every relationship sucks  how do i end up with men or women like this? this is my third business, and i m still not there  i don't see how it's going to happen "" they don't realize that victory is there  and the reason is it feels like a million miles away, and they're doing the right things but at the wrong time  or they're doing the wrong things    they're doing the right things at the wrong sequence  so timing is so invaluable  some of that, you and i know we can't control  some of that is freaking luck  but the more you study how things grow, whether it be organizations or human beings or families or communities or the way in which people study oncology or study knowledge, there's a sequence  it's like if i know somebody's phone number, and i dial the wrong order, i don't reach them  but i do the same exact ingredients the right order, and that's what people need very often  often, they just need a slight twist, and they don't know it  and they give up  and so part of my passion is to help people find that two millimeters, that little tiny shift that changes it all  one of the  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    people    i have these people that i have coached over the years that are the best in the world at what they do    and i'll take on clients who i think by touching them, i can touch massive numbers of people  that's why i started with paul tudor 21 years ago  and it's turned out really well with his robin hood group going giving away a billion to those of his time and the impact he's had  but one of these people is the top    to give you an idea    facial surgeons in the world  and i remember i went to go see him one day for one of our sessions, and he was late  and i'm waiting, and i'm no problem  i'm busy  and the nurse says he's going to be a while  she says, ""doctor says why don't you come in and watch?"" and i said, ""wow, i'd love that "" so i get all scrubbed up, the whole thing  he's got rock and roll music in there  and this guy is like an artist and a scientist mixed together in the most powerful blend with a giant heart  and i go in there, and the music is blaring  and he goes, ""hey tony  how you ?"" he goes, ""watch this "" he cuts  he lifts this woman's face off tim ferriss   oh jesus!  tony robbins   and i felt a little state change, and i was like    i stayed around for a few minutes just to make it look like i can handle this shit  and i said, ""i got a few calls that i ve got to make"" and got the hell out of there  so i go into    he says, ""just use my office  make my calls "" so i'm recovering in his office   tim ferriss   puke in the basket   tony robbins   holy shit  i'm not a squeamish guy, but i just wasn't prepared  so i'm sitting in his office, and he's entered a stage of life where    this is a guy that  inaudible  paid  2 million to fly him over 15 20 years ago to do two of his family's faces  this was the guy that anybody in hollywood who had the money    in those days, there was nobody but him, the best on earth because he'd mathematically figured out how to trigger beauty by what you and would call subnormalities, like shorthand for you, nlp term, those little visual trigger devices that affect kinesthetic change in human beings  and so i'm sitting in his desk, and he's got this manuscript  so i'm curious of the manuscript he's working on, and he wants to finally teach other surgeons  because he's old  he doesn't want it just himself anymore  he wants his material not to die, and he's got a 150 pictures of the most beautiful women in the world in the last  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    20 years across culturally around the world, stars, movie stars, different countries  and he's got the same thing for men, and then he's got all these drawings, and he showed    this is ironic  he goes through, and he shows that he makes no more than seven changes ever, and the biggest change he makes is two millimeters  and yet i saw an 84 year old woman look like she was in her early 50's and gorgeous  and that's all the changes he made on her  i'm telling you it's mind boggling  like for example, he knows the measurement of the pupil of a woman's eye  if you measure that size, and you measure the distance below your nose to the top of a woman's lip    this is only for a woman    if that measurement is smaller than the pupil of their eye, men, when they look at this women's face, are driven and sexually attracted to her  if it's the same size pupil, there's attraction  if it's just two millimeters more, she has an average face  if it's more than two millimeters more, her face is what he calls butt ass ugly    that was a technical term he used at that point  but so when i told women to start measuring their eye    so he makes this little change and makes that puckered feeling that men don't even know why    it's instinctive  it's just a triggering device that's instinctual  so he knows the seven    he knows the two millimeters    i was like, ""you take somebody 84    50 and looking pretty damn hot  maybe not to a 20 year old, but a 30 or 40 year old certainly, mind boggling "" so it's like golf  two millimeters is the difference between shanking it over here or putting it on the green  so that's the whole thing  victory is near, but you've got to know that  very often, syntax is all that has to change  there's nothing wrong with you  there's nothing wrong with the core ingredients  you ve got to sequence it differently  tim ferriss   so you've mentioned a few things  the first is that    hand bigger than someone's head or face  i think that for everyone listening, at some point, i would like to see if you can palm my face, and i'll put that out on social media because i'm pretty sure that you can  and i'm sure everybody would love to see  there are probably a lot of people who don't like me very much and would like to palm my face  so tony will step in for you later  i'd love for you to mention a little bit about the new book  and just sort of very basic overview, and then i have a bunch of specific questions because this is the first book in 20 years?  tony robbins   20 years   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   20 years  and i've read pretty much everything that you've put out that i'm aware of  and i guess that part of me thought a few things when i saw that this book was related to money and also referring to it as a game in some ways  i thought number one, what hasn't already been said? there's so many books   tony robbins   that's what the publishers said   tim ferriss   there are so many books on money, and i think that    perhaps undeservedly so    i feel like i understand a lot as it relates to investing and money  and i ve read david swensen  i've read about his allocations  i've read the annual letters of warren buffet  i read the letters to shareholders from people like howard marx or other hedge fund managers  i know some of those guys  so i saw a couple of names pop up that i recognized  and i was    and you said in the very beginning of the book    and this is    i've tried to do stuff like this in the past, but i realize how hard it is  you're trying to write a book that the neophyte, someone who's never taken their finances seriously, will derive a lot of value from  and yet at the same time, you say even very sophisticated investors will be able to get a lot out of this book  and i thought to myself   tony robbins   he's full of shit   tim ferriss   ""oh boy  this is really talking a big game "" and the interviews at the end of the book alone are worth magnitudes of order more than the book itself  i mean, you've got bogle    you've got ray dalio who runs the    i believe it's still the largest   tony robbins   largest hedge fund in the world, largest mutual fund with bogle  largest hedge fund with ray dalio    carl icahn, who time magazine put him on the cover as master of the universe  this guy sends out one tweet and apple goes up 17 billion in an hour  it's up 50   he was out doing it again today  i don't know if you saw  carl is quite a character  yeah, no    two things  one, commenting on what you said, that's the challenge that i love  when i do my business mastery programs, i bring people in from   usually somewhere between 15 and 30 countries  i translate four or five languages  they're different financial systems, but business    the psychology and the strategies of business, it's a worldwide game  and so i bring people in there that are brand new  they come in like just starting a business, and you've got people in there like homemax, largest home builder in mexico, at one of my  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    events    a billion dollar business  and they credit me with  750 million increase in two years, almost doubling their business  and i take this chiropractor or this dentist, army of three and show them how to double their business in six months  so i love that challenge of how do you hit both, and it's not easy to do  and thus far, i think we've pulled it off primarily because it's not me doing the teaching  it's me going to the best on earth and getting them   inaudible  same thing  people say, ""why did you write a book after 20 years? what the hell have you been doing?"" well, about every four days, i'm on an airplane  i see a quarter of a million people a year in fifteen countries  that's what the hell i'm doing  and i love    i live for that environment, the rawness, the aliveness    every moment, something is changing  you never know who is going to stand up  you don't know what the challenge is going to be  i mean, that feels alive  and also, it's just real and it's now  and if it's not working, freaking change it  who cares? when i go to write as i did 20 years ago, i'm sitting still  that first alone makes me crazy  and number two, you took away my hands, my music, my voice, my face, my intensity, and now i ve just written words, which i'm clearly not as skilled at  but when i concentrate on it, i am  but i also go with    this is immortal  i can't improve this  once you write this shit, it's done  so i'm avoiding it like the plague, and then also most people don't read frankly  they read blogs    it's like most people    i can see a generation    look at this book, it's 600 and    what?    pages  but it's these seven steps  you can do a chapter day, and in 30 days, you've got a different financial life  and if you're crazy like me, you'll do it in a weekend  but what's interesting is they'll say, ""why don't you put this in a blog? why don't you put this in an infographic?"" mastery doesn't come from an infographic  what you know doesn't mean shit  what do you do consistently? and you got to go through stages of understanding intellectually, which anybody can do but you got to do    and you got to get to where there's enough emotional intensity attached to that understanding that you actually do it  and then you got to get enough consistent in both of those that it gets in your body, and you don't have to think about it  it becomes who you are  and those stages of mastery require  it's like i took tae kwon do  i didn't want to learn tae kwon do  i wanted to learn aikido because i thought it was a beautiful art, and i like the idea that you didn't have to hurt somebody  10 copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    people attack you at once, and it's like wonderful  so i learned some aikido, but i had the privilege of being exposed to grandmaster june ree, who brought tae kwon do to this country  and he trained muhammed ali, and he trained bruce lee and his punch and so forth    amazing history and a beautiful man, like the most happy human being you'll ever meet  and he loved me and what i did, and he was touched by it  and he said, ""would you like to do this?"" and i was 23 34, so i said, ""yes, but i must get black belt fastest time in human history  and you must come travel with me  we will do this every day"" like you're an insane ass  tim ferriss   right  yeah, i read your book in two days   tony robbins   completely insane  so he came, and i finished stepping off stage at midnight or 1 a m , and then i have to go train from 1 00 to 4 00  and then i'd sleep from 4 00 to 7 30, three and a half hours, four hours    sometimes 8 00 if i could squeeze it    get up and do my next day  i do that for nine months  i did get a black belt, legitimately in the shortest time in history  but i hated it, and i'd never want to do it again  but i'll never forget    i was doing these moves, and it's like it's 4 00 in the morning, and i'm doing the same freaking move  and i'm doing it over and over and over again  and i said, ""master ree, can we go to the next move?"" and he said, ""grasshopper, this is the next move "" and he started to laugh  he said, ""the fact that you think this and this is still the same move is why we're still doing it "" and it was really true  so i'm into mastery, and so what i really wanted to make sure happened with people is that we got them to that place  and when i went to  inaudible , who's a crazy thing    so i'm doing these events  i'm loving this   inaudible  been begging me for a book for decades, huge contract and he made it bigger and bigger  and i said, ""i don't need the money  i'm not doing it for the money "" so they finally came back, and what triggered me is i saw this documentary called inside job    did you see it?  tim ferriss   yeah, great   tony robbins   yeah, matt damon did the audio on it, and it won all kinds of awards  but what's happened    if you didn't see it, i really recommend you see it  but i do want to prepare you, at the end, you're either extremely pissed off or you're really depressed depending upon your personality  i was pissed off because they  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    showed how a small number of people basically put the entire economic world at risk, and when they put us near imploding, the punishment for that was to reward them by putting them in charge of the recovery, printing more money, and then taxing everybody else on earth and giving them money back  it's just the greatest thievery that's happened in human history  and so i thought this is making me angry that there's no solution  and i thought there's got to be a solution  and i thought i got access  the one thing, i've got access because i've coached paul for 21 years, and he's never lost money in 21 years  it's mindboggling  his company hasn't lost in 28 years  i was brought in when he was having a tough time to help take things to the next level  and i thought, ""i know these people  i know this process  what if i took what the ultra wealthy had and brought it in?"" so i think i got this great strategy, and they wanted a book forever  and the first thing they say is, ""no "" what do you mean? you can't tell me no  jonathan is bringing that, and you don't want to do this  people are dying for a book on  inaudible  and dying for a book on anything, but not finance  this category is a dead carcass  it's been picked clean, same things you're saying ironically  so did the head of the financial division  he goes, ""there's nothing new to say "" i say, ""that's because everybody has attacked the same way  i'm going to go to the people that know, not the platitudes of the same bs "" he actually offered me a larger advance to not do a financial book  i said, ""look, i'm not doing it for that  i'm in for this book "" and so now he's really thrilled, which is really wonderful  in fact, the head of that division came back and said,  i really thought the category was dead "" i had the vision  he goes, ""this is a life "" so i m real proud of it  but i think what's great about the book is there's not a word in there that's coming from me on the financial side  i don't tell you my opinion  who gives a shit what my opinion is? i want ray dalio's opinion  i want to know jack bogle's opinion  i want to know carl icahn s  i want to know what mary callahan erdoes who's head of jp morgan and manages 3 2 trillion with a t  i want to know her opinion  when it comes to the emotional or psychological side, yeah that's in me for 36 years  those opinions are clearly mine  i'll stand on them  so i m real proud of what it is  and i think anybody who reads it will be touched, and i wrote it to empower readers of all types  but i also wrote it because i was thinking about a vehicle for righting another wrong in my copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    opinion  i think the system is clearly    if you read flyboys or you talk to michael lewis or anybody like him, they'll describe to you how high frequency trading today is so extreme    we've all heard about it    but it's just so extreme  it takes 500 milliseconds for you to click on your e trade and say i want to buy this stock of apple  and you've got guys who spend a quarter of a billion dollars to straighten lines between chicago and new york so they could save 1 4 milliseconds  and they're going to trade hundreds, maybe thousands, of times  they know you're going after apple  they know what to do to make money, little micro profits  one of the hft groups was going to go public last year, so they went into their filings  do you know how many losing days they had in four years? tim ferriss   i do not   tony robbins   one  one losing day in four years  it's front running  so the system is rigged  but even though it's rigged, you can still win  that's why i wrote this book  i wanted you to know that you can still win and here's how to win  and here's the people showing you how to win  so i want to right that wrong  i wanted people to have an advocate, but also i'm pretty passionate about taking care of people that society has forgotten  and i decided initially, i wanted to raise my game  they cut  8 7 billion from food stamps last summer  most people don't even notice it  it's the equivalent of every family who's being supported going without food for one week out of the month for twelve straight months  and i've been supporting    my family was fed when i was 11 years old  i had no food, family    this man came by and delivered a turkey and food  it was just the delivery guy  it changed my life  it made me believe strangers care, so i cared about strangers  so i've been paying it forward, and i've fed 42 million in 37 years  this year, i'm going to feed 50 million people, and myself personally    i started with i'm going to advance the book    i'm going to wait and sell books and see how it goes  i'm just going to dance it all down  well, i don't want to do 10 million  i want to do 20 million, and then 30  so now i m doing 50 million, and i m getting matching funds  i have feeding america delivering the food, and i m getting matching funds targeting 100 million people this year alone, and then i'm putting a system in place to sustain that   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    so doing this book has been opening up doors to thinking larger  because when you're sitting with carl icahn, and he goes, ""yeah, i just closed the deal today  i made  2 billion ""  2 billion the day i was there    after only 18 months of investment, where he    i forgot the number he started in netflix  he made it that day, and he's now putting all his money in apple  and he does that little tweet and  17 billion in value goes up right away  or you're sitting with kyle bass who took  30 million and turned it into  2 billion in 2 years and then milled the subprime crisis  tim ferriss   good at the short game   tony robbins   and he's telling me this like holy cow  i started to learn things, so it changes the scale of your thinking  so i'm babbling here because what i want people to know is two things  yes, i think this truly  if you give yourself the gift of this book, it's a category breaker  but it will show you step by step how to go wherever you want to be  if you're highly advanced, you're going to learn of the 55 plus   say 50, but it was really 55 plus    nobel laureates, self made billionaires, hedge fund guys, biggest in the world    i put the twelve biggest in the book  and i went to these guys with the promise of a 45 minute interview, and my average one was 3 hours  so i know how you function because i do the same thing  but was really cool was i get in with carl, and the first thing he does is he throws the video crew out  it's like, ""carl, what's the deal?"" i'd never met him before  he's like, ""no, i said video crew, but i just changed my mind "" okay, how do we do the interview? well, we'll do the audio  no, i don't want the audio  no audio? how am i going to do this interview? just take your pencil and your pen here  get over here, and i'll give you ten minutes  and three hours later, i'm out  pictures with he and his wife, and he's saying, ""you got a way to help change this world "" and he's endorsing the book and supports it  so i want people to know that this has been a four year journey of going to the smartest people on earth and finding out the vast majority are incredibly genuine in wanting the average person to do well  they just didn't think there was anybody that translate it  and when they saw that i could, and i could pitch and catch with them   because i do 18 hours of prep before i sit down with ray dalio  they want to share things that they've never shared before  and later on, maybe we can talk about what i learned from ray dalio  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    because it's pretty amazing  tim ferriss   oh, i do want to talk about ray  and fascinating guy, i m so fascinated with the entire world  i mean, whether it's    and there's so many different breeds  this is something i wanted to talk about    but you have say the paul tudor jones    for those who probably haven't seen a very old film    i think it's available like bootleg vhs    called the trader is an amazing old documentary  you can find it, but you can see his style versus the high frequency guys or a renaissance, all phds right? outside of wall street  and then you have the ray dalio types   tony robbins   but there's all things in common if you look  they all have different strategies, but some are    let's shake the tree of the corporate guys and make sure we get more value out of it  that's carl  and some guys are like templeton    i got to interview multiple times before he died  it's like wait for the bloodletting   tim ferriss   no, blood in the streets  that's when you invest   tony robbins   blood in the streets  but it's like when maximum pessimism hits, that's when you make all your money  that's what he did  and then there's the guys like bogle, which is, ""it's the index baby "" and these days, even warren buffet, it's the index baby  so they all do approaches, but what's in common, i think is    i'll tell you four things i saw that stood out  and one is overly simplistic, and that's why people don't pay attention to it  these guys pay attention to it  they don't lose it  half of the key to awakening is not losing, and they are obsessed    every single one of those is obsessed with not losing money  i mean, a level of obsession that's mind boggling  and it isn't just these investors,  00 59 39  for example  people see richard, and he's such an outgoing playful crazy guy  he's kind of good in some areas, but when it comes to athletics and taking on challenges, he's out in the world  but his first question to every business is, ""what's the downside? and how do i protect it?"" like when he did his peace with virgin    i mean that's a big risk to start an airline  he went to boeing and negotiated a deal that they could send the planes back if it didn't work and he wasn't liable  that's the level these guys think at  so they look to see how do i not lose money first  because the average person has no clue  if i lose 50  in 2008, well guess what? you got to make 100  to get even, not 50  because your principal has gone down so much  it's like people don't understand    you lose 60   it's  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    200  to get even  so the average person lives in a world where they try not to lose money, but they're not obsessed  these are obsessed  second thing they all have in common, every single one of them is obsessed with asymmetrical risk and reward, which is a big word  it simply means they're looking to use the least amount of risk to get the max amount of upside, and that's what they live for  so i'll give you an example  paul tudor, when i first went to do the turnaround when paul was having some challenging times    he'd broken his leg  think about this  he did better than anybody in the history of the world during the biggest stock drop in history literally  and then he went to the mountain, went to moon  now what? and so lost a bit of the edge and got involved in other things and so forth  and now he's got a broken leg  he's not going to the office, and i got to come in  so i had to go watch that film  that's the first thing i did  tim ferriss   the white tennis shoes   tony robbins   i wanted to go see everything about him, study his physiology, the way he used to move    because this is a guy who's not moving at all    what his face was like, how he breathed, tone of his voice  what were the physical strategies? what were the psychological strategies? what were the financial strategies? i got to go to  inaudible   the world we had access to back then was unbelievable    see what was he like then to put the plan together to do this turn around  and when i started making those shifts in him    and you could see the shift happen immediately    it got really exciting  i got hooked on what was going to happen  and i did this same process basically    i think about doing these things once  i did the same process during these interviews  i didn't just look up the trading strategies  i looked up the psychology that set it up  but here's what i found with paul tudor in the very beginning to get him back on track  when he was at his best, he made sure every single trade had    what he called    a five to one  that means if he was going to risk a dollar, he wasn't about to risk it unless he was certain he was going to make five  now you're not always right  so guess what? if i risk a dollar, make five and i'm wrong, i can risk another dollar and still make four  i can be wrong four times out of five and still break even  their secret is not that they're not wrong  it's that they set themselves up where they risk small  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    amounts for big rewards proportionately  paul, if he's right one out of three times, he still makes 20   so the average person risks a dollar trying to make how much? tim ferriss   1 10?  tony robbins   that's right  about 1 10  if i could get 10 , wow my dollar  20  would be unbelievable  how often can you be wrong?  tim ferriss   not very often   tony robbins   not at all  you're in the hole  you're starting from the hole and got to get back up  so their asymmetrical rewards   like i was with kyle bass and kyle bass risked    check this out    in the middle of subprime crisis, he made  2 billion out of  30 million because for every six cents he risked, he had an upside of a dollar  six cents for a hundred  well you can be wrong fifteen times, and you're still looking at it in that area  i mean, he's brilliant to figure that out  he's a genius to figure it out  but that risk reward is why it is  he showed his kids    i said, ""how do i teach this to the average investor?"" and he said, ""you can teach them what i taught my kids?"" and i said, ""how'd you do that?"" he goes, ""we bought nickels "" i said, ""what do you mean you bought nickels?"" he said, ""well, i did research    i had this question "" that's another thing that all these guys do, they ask a better question  we talked about they get better answers  better quality question, better quality answer  what's wrong with me? you'll come up with stuff  how do i make this happen no matter what? you'll come up with different answers  so his question was, ""where in the world is there a risk less trade with total upside?"" and he started looking around, and he said, ""i'm worried about inflation "" so he decided well gosh, of all the currencies of the world, a nickel    what it's made of today    it's not made mostly of nickel by the way    he said it's costing the us government 9 5 cents to make a nickel  that's how our government functions  i'm going to spend almost 10 cents to make something worth half as much   tim ferriss   depending on plan   tony robbins   perfect plan  but he said just the actual material value is 6 8 or whatever it was    six something    6 5 we'll call it for round numbers  so he said, ""if i buy a nickel, it's never going less than a nickel unless you believe the us government is gone  so i've got  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    something that never goes down in value  so i've got a guaranteed return  i'm not going to lose my principal  but day 1, it's worth 36  more than the day i bought it  how many investments can you have a 100  guarantee of no loss and have 36 ?"" and i said, ""yeah, but that's smelt value  and i saw they passed the law a few years ago    i think charlie wrangler or whoever it was was the one that pushed it through "" he goes, ""tony that doesn't matter  let me tell you why  look at pennies  when they changed from pure copper to tin and all things they changed, what happened to the old pennies? there's a scarcity of them  and now a penny from those days is worth two cents  so it's 100  more valuable  so at some point, the government cannot continue to do something that cost twice as much  some point, they'll make a change in the materials  and then all these nickels are worth an unbelievable amount  so i just showed my kids here's a risk    you need to worth different from anybody else  don't think i have to take huge risks for huge rewards  say how do i get no risk and get huge rewards? and because you ask a question continuously and you believe an answer, you get it "" he said, ""look if i convert my entire wealth in nickels right now, i'd do it "" i say, ""you're insane "" he goes, ""i am insane  but it's the best possible fundamental investment "" he started telling me how to do it  he bought 40 million nickels  he has 40 million nickels  it fills up a room bigger than this  tim ferriss   better be on the ground floor   tony robbins   he had his kids drag them in, laughing having fun  it's like their little treasure room   tim ferriss   so he can legitimately do the scrooge mcduck backstroke through a pool full of nickels   tony robbins   with real nickels  so that's asymmetrical reward  i'll give you one more, and i'll shut the hell up   tim ferriss   no  i'm not here for   tony robbins   but i want    you're telling me there are differences  i want you to know there are differences  we could spend hours and hours on the differences  but what i think is useful is what's aligned because then it gives something universal that can be applied   tim ferriss   absolutely   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tony robbins   the other one for them is they absolutely beyond a shadow of a doubt know they're going to be wrong  you look at these talking ads on television and people screaming at you and hitting bells and telling you what to buy, and they re right right right  the best on earth, the ray dalios    i don't care who you talk about    you want to look at carl icahn  they all know they're going to be wrong  so they set up an asset allocation system that will make them successful  they all agree asset allocation is the single most important investment  there wasn't one person    in terms of your vehicle    that it wasn't the most important thing no matter how they attacked it    asset allocation was the element there  and the last one is they're lifelong learners  i mean, these people are machines like you, like me, like peter, like most of the people you and i share as friends  they just are obsessed with knowing more  because the more they know, the more they realize what they didn't know  and then they apply that, and they go to another level  and every time, you think you're the best you can be in anything in life    your body, your emotions, your spirit, your finances    there's always another level  and these guys live by it  and the last one that i found almost all of them were real givers, not just givers on the surface like money givers  that's really wonderful, but really passionate about giving  and it showed up once they saw what i was doing was legitimate  it was really real  then they're opening up three hours of their time  i mean, these guys will never get it   tim ferriss   oh yeah  i mean, their hours are worth a lot  that's saying the least  thank you

37,38,"38: Tony Robbins, Part 2 ","   well, hello there my dear little munchkins  this is tim ferris  i ve had some caffeine since you last heard from me  what you re about to hear is part two of a multi part conversation with tony robbins  to put it briefly, tony robins is a performance strategist with clients including presidents like bill clinton, mother theresa   not making this up   andre agassi, leonardo dicaprio, and oprah winfrey, who calls him superhuman  this guy is a force of nature  if you didn t catch the first part, you might want to do that before venturing in  but really, we jump around a lot, cover a lot of different topics, so if you don t mind your stories as more of a jigsaw puzzle, then by all means, keep on listening from this point on  and now, without further ado, please enjoy part 2, the final part of the tim ferris show with tony robbins   tim ferriss   to touch on a few things that you mentioned, for those people asking themselves, as i m sure a lot of people would  how can i apply what this guys do to what i do? and i think that you present a number of observations articulated very, very well that most people will never be exposed to  for instance, no  1, asset allocation does not mean choosing if you are going to be a stock picker or invest in index fund for the s p 500 because those are both   you re in one bucket right now  you re in a    tony robbins   that s right  you re still    tim ferris   you re in a correlated class   tony robbins   that s right  there s no diversification in that   tim ferris   right  there s more to it    tony robbins   well, there s some   inaudible  there s going to be more companies, but it s all within the same asset class   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferris   yeah, and the other thing is that there are ways to look at the problem that are not obvious right off the bat  for instance, you mentioned something that s so simple, but a lot of people miss  if you invest, and you lost 50 percent, you have to now have 100 percent gain to get back to break even  put another way, and this is also straight from the book, let s just say   i think it was investing over   it was either five or ten years  the exact number is in the book  you had invested in the stock market through a   let s just call it off the shelf mutual fund that charges typical fees, and the market moves up and down, up and down, up and down  at the end of that period of time, you re back at the same market levels  you would think if you put in  100,000 00 you d have  100,000 00 at the end of that period of time, and it ends up that you re, what, 47 percent down?  tony robbins   yeah   tim ferris   something obscene   tony robbins   it s the idea average rates of return  a lot of people look at what they ve invested, and their broker or whoever represents them will show them the portfolio and go,  look, you started here  you went up 50 percent, you down 50, but you went up 50, and you went down 50, so your average rate of return is zero  but if i put real dollars in there,  100,000 00, and you go up 50 or 150, you go down 50, you re at 75  you go up 50, oops, and then you go down, and you end up at  37,000 00 instead of  100,000 00 because your principle is moving up and down  there are all these ways we could do it  the biggest one   the biggest lie   in the book, i walk you through seven steps  one of those steps is, frankly, you got to do what most of us guys that probably do the listing on your team already do, and that is, you ve got to become and investor   you ve got to be an owner, not a consumer, right? the way to do that, frankly, we all know, but very few people do, and that s you take a percentage, you lock it down, and you never see it  it s automated, and you put it aside for investment, and that just occurs  i ve showed the people some of the tools that nobel prize winners have come up with  if you say,  i have no money,  you could invest more for tomorrow by committing when you get a raise or when your company gets to the next level  you automatically have that percentage go there, so it s money you ve never seen  it s taking away money from you, so you re willing to commit to it, right?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferris   and there are ways to automate that   tony robbins   totally automated, which is fantastic  they took a group of blue collar workers who couldn t save more than three percent, and they showed in 12 years they had them up to 16 percent with absolutely no sense of loss because once   they show this with example  a behaviorist showed me that if you give that monkey an apple, they go crazy, and if you give them two apples, and they go crazy  if you take one of two apples back, they re angry as hell  they still have the same first apple  what happens is if you don t give them that second apple, but it gets invested for them that changes your world  you don t feel a sense of loss, there s no drop, and yet, you set yourself up saving 15, 16, and 17 percent in a totally different world than 3 or nothing, obviously  second piece that i brought this up for is you ve got to   it s great to get in the game, but oh, my god, don t get in the game until you understand the rules, until you re and insider, and so i go through the nine biggest lies  they re investment lies  they re wall street lies   however you want to call them, but they re marketed lies  there s a reason you believe them   tim ferris   very heavily marketed lies   tony robbins   very heavily marketed, to the advantage, right? one of those is this idea that they re going to beat the market  here are the real facts  96 percent   check it out   96 percent of all mutual funds, in a ten year period, will never even match the market  now, you re paying a premium  you could ve owned an index that costed you 20 basis points at vanguard or 14 basis points depending what index you re doing  instead, you re paying, they say, one percent  you ask people  inaudible  one percent  in reality, if you go through   forbes has shown the average mutual fund when you put all fees in   if you read the perspectives, and there s all these 21 b trading   all these things that don t   they don t call for these very often, but they are money out of your pocket  the average is 3 1 percent  now, when you do that, here s the problem  no  1, only four percent   what s your chance of picking the four percent of mutual funds that are going to be succeed  if you go for morningstar, you re screwed because i can show you statistically  morningstar s own statistics have shown a ten year period of 250 people that  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    made it to five star morningstar, four are left  doesn t work that way, right? if you could pick the four percent, if you were magically able to do that, you could do all right, but the four percent s always changing  your chances of picking the right mutual fund are 96 percent against you, and the average person s 401k at work   they don t know how to evaluate this  they try and pick it, so they re screwed  and then you get poor performance, and you pay somewhere between 10 and 30 times more for the same investment you could ve got for 10 to 30 times less  it s like the ultimate insult to injury, and go,  why does that mater?  well, first, let me give you this  so people understand what 96 percent means, they re getting a 4 percent possible success rate  if you and i played black jack   most people know how to play, right? twenty one  i get two face cards that are worth 20 points  if you re inner idiot says hit me when you ve got two face cards to go to 21, you have an 8 percent chance of success  you have a greater chance of success there than you did if you re going to find the right mutual fund  now, what s your chance of success in getting financially free when   here s what s unbelievable  if i said to you,  here s an investment i want you to try, tim  here s how it works  you put up all the money, you put up all the risk, and i will put up no money, and i will put up no risk, and if you win, i get up to 60 percent of your entire growth of what you have over the lifetime of your investing  you put all money  inaudible , i take no risk, i put no money  and if you lose, you lose, but i don t lose anything  that s a deal that most people would say,  i d never take in a million years   that s the average mutual fund  for every one percent you pay, it s 20 percent over the lifetime of your investments of growth because just like there s compounded growth, there are compounded fees  vogel showed me, 60 percent   i m saying,  jack, how s this possible? how could people be doing this?  he goes,  tony, it s the  13 trillion lie, and it s called one thing, marketing   i ve been in the business 64 years  it makes me crazy, and people still do it  the vast majority of people put their money in a mutual fund  they  inaudible   now, he s come to be the largest mutual fund in the world with an index fund now with  2 5 trillion  jack has been modified, but most of the smart money is there   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    it s not the average person s money that s in the index today  i go through these lies, and what you don t know in the financial world will hurt you, and the one you re talking about is just the average rate of return  you want to be seduced  when you look at the rate of return   vogel said to me, he said,  tony, whatever you see what the rate of return was and you re trying to evaluate that mutual fund based on its past performance, just to know that number s not accurate   dalbar did a great study   20 year study  they found the average mutual fund owner of a 20 year period of time made 2 5 percent in that  the at market was 9 7 percent  that ought to give you sense  i went to go do this book   and i won t mention the person s name  i got all these incredible endorsements from everybody   nobel prize winners, self paid billionaires   all these guys  there s a particular person that i m   a really good friend  i won t mention his name, but it was ironic  he wrote me back and said,  well, me team s read it, and they don t think it s really that special   i thought, well, i m not insulted by that, but it doesn t make sense to me  then, i found out this person has six mutual funds  inaudible , so it s like,  okay, i get it, dude   tim ferris   yeah, don t ask a barber if you need a haircut   tony robbins   that s my fault  i m so sorry  never should ve asked that question   tim ferris   sorry about that one, yeah   tony robbins   he should ve told me   tim ferris   i should point out to folks, also   some people are very math phobic  part of the reason i went to princeton   it s funny, i was reading carl icahn s story and how he was told he would never get into any ivy league schools, and he chose princeton  same thing happened to me  i was told i would never get into a whole host of schools because   and this is kind of like your mutual fund guy   humans respond to incentives   tony robbins   yes   tim ferris   and this particular guidance counselor is incentivized for what? to optimize, to be able to say x percentage of students got into their first choice school  so how do you do that most easily    tony robbins   lower their expectations   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferris   lower their expectations  i am intrinsically not someone with a lot of math background  part of the reason i chose princeton over other schools is because they didn t have a math requirement, and i think for a lot of people listening, they may be like,  oh, my god, percentages and compounding odds, it s very overwhelming   i think that part of the reason your book had to be as long as it is   and a book should be as long as it needs to be   is that if you were to try to compress it into a 100 pages, it would be like watching a 3 hour action movie, but getting a frame every 5 minutes  it would be too much in too little space  but when people read the book   when i read the book   you re leading people in a logical progression from building block to building block to building block so that, by the end, people are very, very savvy  so people who might be thinking,  oh, my god, this is really a lot for me to absorb  ,   tony robbins   i m probably talking 100 miles an hour  in the book, i m telling you stories, too, and i think the stories take it away so it s not numberage  you go,  holy shit, if me and three of my friends all put aside the same amount of money, and we both get a seven percent return, but my buddy s getting fees of three percent, my other buddy s two, and i m one, and all three of us put  1 million in or  100,000 00,  however you want to do it, the person with three percent of fees ends up with 65 percent less money, and they got the same rate of return, they start with the same amount of money over the same period of time  i think when you see that with real people s lives, you start to go,  i don t have to know the math  i just know one thing  fees matter, and i m going to cut those babies to absolute base    tim ferris   definitely  i d love to talk   you brought it up a little bit earlier, ray dalio and asset allocation because this is something i ve been thinking about a lot considering that due to paper gains, i d say i have a very, very, very high double digits of my entire network in tech  it s hard, unfortunately, to rebalance when you have a lot of private stock that can t be traded   tony robbins   of course, been there   tim ferris   you know how it is  dalio is someone i ve been fascinated by for so long  maybe you could talk about the all seasons and some of  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    the stuff that you chatted with him about as it relates to asset allocation  tony robbins   it might be helpful for people to take a second and give people his background  ray is not the guy you would think of as master of the universe  he comes from queens  his dad was a jazz musician  his mom was a homemaker, a really lovely lady  we went from a very lower middle class family and decided that he wanted to go work at a golf course  he bumped into   one of the things i talk about is proximity effects your life, who you re in proximity with, and he s around and in proximity with very wealthy people, and they re talking about stalks, and he got fascinated by it and got hooked on the process, and then got involved in stock business  he got involved in a time period when the world was incredibly volatile, the 1970s  we re all shaped by our time periods, right? you can imagine, that s a time we have this massive inflation where nixon goes on television and says,  we re going off the gold standard that money, as you know it called the u s  dollar, we re not going to back up with anything,  and he thought for sure the markets would just be destroyed  the american dollar s going to be worthless  instead, they had what was called the nixon rally, and it shook him to his core that as much you think you know, you don t know, and it gave him a lifelong focus that says,  i always want to be asking, what do i not know, and how do i understand the system as a whole, not just my perspective on the system   he started bridgewater, and, in fact, my friend, paul tudor jones gave him some of his initial capital to do this and wishing he didn t loan it to him, but would ve kept it as an investment, i think, at this stage because bridgewater is so gigantic  what happened was, he s the guy the u s  government went to when they re trying  to figure out how to design tips  this is the level of design  he s the guy that when mcdonald s is trying  to come out with mcnuggets, and they re trying to figure out,  how can we make sure we have enough supply of chicken,  he s the one that figure out the math of futures and what to do so mcdonald s could even do that  that s the way this man s brain works  over the years, he s built this alpha fund, and it s very intensive, and he s lost money in 23 years three times on that fund, and the fund is returned 21 percent compounded for 23 years, just mindboggling   before fees   and then turn around and   after all these years, he said,  everybody talks about at different stages of your life, you want to protect yourself so you do a balanced portfolio, 50 percent, 60 percent in  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    stocks, maybe, and 40 or 50 percent here in bonds because when the stocks  inaudible  till the bonds are going to balance you out  he says,  you know, it didn t look that way in 2000  it didn t look that way in 2000,    it all went down in 2008, right? over the years he said,  this is a story of everybody buys, but it s not reality in whole segments of time  so he began to pursue what he said    what if i wasn t around? i need an almost passive form of investment   i need something that wouldn t take 1,500 people, that my kids could use, that would support all my philanthropic efforts if i wasn t here   he questioned everything about asset allocation, that everything everybody s ever been taught, and came up with a different way of looking at it where he basically said,  there are four things that move the price of any investment  it s inflation and deflation, and whether the economy is growing or shrinking, and that creates four different seasons in which   every type of investment, stocks, commodities, gold, real estate, it has an ideal environment in which it grows and has environments in which it will absolutely slam  he figured out, what s the right combination of these things so that i can reduce the risk to the lowest level of loss possibly, which if you know warren buffet s rules,   everybody talks about the rule, right? it isn t warren buffet s rule  it actually comes from his teacher, which was, rule no  1 to investing, don t lose money, rule no  2, and see rule no  1, right? so how do i make that happen, but also maximize the amount   the upside, as much upside as possible  he called this all weather fund because it works in all weather, and he did all his own investing for ten years, and he back tested it all the way to 1925, and said,  oh, my god, i have discovered something unbelievable   so the only people that got to use this are he and then, finally, his clients, the  5 billion net worth, the governments, the pension funds  i ve read about it, and ray does very few interviews, as i m sure you know  you go online, and you won t find a whole lot   in front of the congress, maybe at dabos every now and then  he avoids any publicity and so forth  i did all my homework on him  paul tudor s one of his dearest friends, arranged to go see him, laid it all out, and i was prepared, and then i go into this meeting, and i start asking him   i asked him the question i ask everybody, which was if you couldn t pass on any of your money to your copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    children   none   all you could pass on was a set of principles, an investment strategy, and a portfolio, what would it be   for your kids because they don t have your skill? everybody gave me a different answer, but his answer was,  well, it d be my all weather approach   i said,  explain to me how it works   he explained it   inaudible  just like me telling it to you right now real fast  people are probably going,  i don t have a clue what he just said  it seems logical   the one thing he said is,  tony, when people think they ve got a balanced portfolio, stocks is three times more volatile than bonds  so when you re 50 50, you re really 90 10  you really are massively at risk, and that s why when the markets go down, you get eaten alive   so he has this portfolio and describes his principles  i said,  you know what, ray, this is spectacular  i understand it,  but i said,  the only way you really get the result from this is if you know the exact percentages   if you ve got somebody s recipe and you put in a gallon when they put in a teaspoon of a particular ingredient, you re messed up  i said,  i need the secret sauce,  and he looks at me and laughs  he goes,  tony, that s my business,  and that s when he gave me the whole  5 billion net worth and got to have  100 million  i said,  yeah, ray, but you just got done telling me you haven t taken anybody s money for ten years, and you re not going to take anybody s money   he goes,  yeah, but it s really complex   i said,  i know it is, but give me a simple version   he said,  no  it s always changing   i said,  give me a version with no leverage that the average person can do   you just got done telling me that going to the broker, going to the wealth manager, going to a mutual fund s not going to work, so help a little guy out  i know you can   i started teasing him   come on  give me the juice   he started laughing, and he goes,  well, i can give you something  it wouldn t be perfect   i said,  i don t want perfect  your worst design will be the best design anybody else will ever come up with   i got him going, and he said,  well, we might do  ,  and he lays out this simple strategy  i was vibrating  i was like vibrating  i knew what he generosity level was  it was unbelievable  he s never revealed it to anyone in history, and i ran as fast as i could  i got in the helicopter, flew back, went to the guys at hightower, went to guys at two other firms, and i said,  i want you to run these numbers  show me the modern period  show me the last 30 years  what really happened with this formula every single year for 30 years, and what s the overall for the 30 years,  because that s   i look at 30 years, 1984, that s when we finally had cell phones even, right? that s when copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    the world started to shift   show me 40 years, and shoe me 75 years  take me back right before the depression even   the guy texted me in the middle of the night   and he never texts me   and he says,  have you seen the number?  i ll never forget it  i get up  i call him on the phone  i said,  what? no, i haven t seen them   he e mails them to me, and ray was right  eighty five to 86 percent of the time, every time period we look at between  85 and  86, 30 years, 40 years, 75 years   and by the way, that s being liberal because the 15 percent where he lost money   the most he ever lost was 3 95 percent in 75 years, and that was 2008 when the market s peaked trough was down 51 percent  the average loss, including that, was 1 9 percent  for example, one of his losses was 0 03  really, it was break even, but we called it a loss because, technically, it s a loss  if you could go to vegas, and you knew that for 75 years the strategy you used had been successful 85 percent of the time, and that when you lose, the most you lost was 1 9 percent, how much would you bet, how long would you continue to gamble? you still have to figure it out  i mismatched, and i took it to some very large institutions until    i ve never seen anything like this   a couple people said to me,  don t put this in the book  this is a business, man  this is a business  this ll give you the lowest low volatility with the highest level of return  it averages just under ten percent return with that little volatility  it s mindboggling  i said,  you know what, that s not the spirit it was shared in  we can do this for people if they want to do it  we have that option, but i m putting it in the book so anybody can do it,  and it s in the book, right, then, and there  it s not the only one  there are strategies for everybody   crosstalk  tony robbins   but it s one of the more exciting ones that you ll see   tim ferris   is there anything   totally up to you   is there anything you can share from what he told you about the all weather? i will just say as a preface, look, there s so much in this book  no  1, i ve had, also, people say to me, for instance   i m not going to name any of my close friends, but they re like,  yeah,  inaudible   it s fine  give me the index card    tony robbins   i know, i know   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferris   i give them the index card, and there s context missing, and it s not just because they can t, in some cases, do it because they re missing the details  they won t do it  get the book  do yourself a favor   tony robbins   i m not holding back on that   inaudible   the reason i wouldn t share that is because it ll be out of context  even in the book, i tell people in the first chapter, i tell them this result  i give them one example, and i say,  i know the first thing you re going to want to do is turn back to that section of the book,  and i said,  you can do it, but i caution you   there s a syntax  there s a sequence  the dog  inaudible  with the dog, and if you will go through this sequence, it s going to be more  if you know that portfolio, but you don t know, truthfully, what your risk tolerance is, you don t know truly what your personal goals are, you don t know what you need to avoid on the fee structure and the tax structures, then that return won t be very great for you  more importantly, you won t go through the psychology it ll actually make you follow through for a while  but if people want to do it   by the way, i then went to hightower, which is the fifth largest risk investment advisory in the united states,  30 billion in assets, 13th fastest inc  magazine company   fastest growing company   amazing  elliot is the ceo  blown away by this man  i did an interview with him, and i left there going,  this man is committed to total transparency  this man blows out all those fees, all the  ,  to say it in the nicest way possible,  screwing over that happens to most clients   he eliminates that  he s a former litigator  he s got a moral code that s pretty intense  i loved him  i came back, and i called him up, and i said,  let s meet again   met again, and said,  you know, i ve got a challenge for you  how about you do this for everybody else?  he said,  what are you talking about?  i said,  how about for the average man that really needs it?  he says,  what are you talking about?  i said,  bring that ultrawealthy advice to them  show them on a small scale how they can do what your ultra wealthy client does   he goes,  tony, you can t make money doing that   i said,  you don t need to make money doing it  i m doing a book  i m not making any money doing it  a part of our life has to be for something more  i know that s what you re about, but i m talking about putting your business at risk  let s use technology, technology with live people   the balance    copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and so we built, together, a site   i put him together with this group called stronghold, which is brilliant  they ve been managing my money for me for the past seven years  ajay gupta, he s actually the person that charles schwab put on the cover of most magazines over the last year as the face of the 10,000 rich investment advisory fiduciaries around the world and around the country  the two of them got together, came to the site   it s kind of like check your broker  now, you can go online, and you can put in all your accounts  it ll aggregate them  it s a patented technology  you get to see, a, what your real costs are and everything all in one picture  there s no bs   versus what you could have the same investments for  it s like, why would i pay more  second thing it does is it shows you what your real returns have been combined versus what you think they are, and third, it shows you what you what your volatility levels have been, the amount of risk you re taking so you know, and then fourthly, it does a comparison to that versus other portfolios, including the one designed by ray dalio, and you can go,  wow do i want to do this?  if you re a person like half the u s , less than  25,000 of investable assets, you get to do the whole thing for free  it s given to you  go do it  if you are not, you have more, you can still do it for free  you can do it yourself, or you can push a button and say,  i d like you to become my registered investment advisory,  and somebody can do it   inaudible   most of these people you re never going to see anything from, but wealthy people started not wealthy, right? so it s really cool  it s one of those few   as corny as it sounds   win wins, right? these guys are adding value  i got them to do it, and now, they re proud of it and excited about it  it s a cool thing  to answer your question  tim ferris   what is the url?  tony robbins   the url is   what is it? strongholdfinancial com  i have to double check, but i m pretty sure that s it   tim ferris   okay, we ll double check that and also go into show notes   tony robbins   got it   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferris   you were saying,  to answer your question   i didn t want to cut you off   tony robbins   oh, which one? i m sorry   tim ferris   i ve had a lot of questions   tony robbins   which one?  tim ferris   let me highlight a couple things    tony robbins   oh, yeah, answer your question  i said, i don t want to come in here because even in the book i don t do it until you get there  it won t mean anything to you  i m not holding anything back  you go to the bookstore, open it up, and not pay anything, i don t give a shit, but i think you d be doing yourself a disservice  what you really want to do is take yourself through the process so that when you get to that point, you can decide,  do i want that value to be 20 percent of what i do, 5 percent, 10 percent, none, 50,  because there are many different strategies in the book, including, as you said, david swensen  david swensen is the most successful institutional investor of all time from yale  he took their amount of money from  1 billion to  23 9 billion    24 billion now   in two decades  he s a rock star, nicest human being you ll ever meet in your life, and doesn t get paid one tenth the rest of these guys  it s his dedication to yale is why he s there  he could leave there and be in a totally different place  when he had cancer, the man said,  listen, i m not going anywhere  this is my bucket list is to be here and to continue to serve at yale   a man of such unbelievable integrity, and he gave me his exact portfolio   it s in the book also   and he actually gets a higher return, to give you an idea, than ray does, but you have to go through a hell of a lot more volatility, obviously  so that s why your risk   you see why you ve got to know what your real   what you think risk reward is and your mindset versus what it really is, you ll know when you go through the book   tim ferris   if i can make a request  i would love for you to interview the guy who hired swensen for yale because talk about the best hire of all time   tony robbins   no kidding, no kidding   tim ferris   just the psychological profile on the guy is so unique  a couple of things i d just like to underscore for folks   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    the first is   and again, this is pulling stuff from the book  i m going to paraphrase some of it  i think it was dalio who said something along the lines of loser reacts, winders anticipate  tony robbins   that s actually me, but that s okay   tim ferris   it was you   tony robbins   i ll give it to ray dalio   tim ferris   well    crosstalk  tim ferris   as a compliment  the point being that the   and i guess mark twain quote is also in there, which was what? history doesn t repeat itself, but it rhymes  there are going to be crashes  there are going to be black swan events   tony robbins   for sure   tim ferris   you want to have a plan in place for when that happens  the more you can automate many of your financial decisions, know when to hold them and know when to fold them, and actually have a plan going   so if you buy something and have no plan for selling it, you re going to be subject to impulse reactions that will cause you to do what the vast majority of people do  they buy high, and they sell low   tim ferris   what we re talking about when we talk about asset allocation among other things, just to try distill it for people as a concept is that you have uncorrelated or inversely correlated bucket so that if one portion of your investments goes down because of inflation, deflation   fill in the blank   there are others that go up, which mitigate your risk   tony robbins   that s correct   tim ferris   what you notice   and i live in silicon valley  i m very involved with tech  that s been my sandbox for the last, close to ten years i guess, and what you notice about the   okay, 95 percent  so talk about   venture capital is very similar to mutual funds, so the vast majority are horrible  as a class, they re terrible  however, if you pick the unicorns   and you used the same term    copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tony robbins   reid hoffman or something    tim ferris   yeah, yeah  there are handfuls that are very, very consistent  so what i ve tried to do   just like you tried to do with a lot of these hedge fund managers is look at what separates them   tim ferris   what separates them is you have the vast majority if tech investors who think,  high risk, high return  i ve got to swing for the fences  i ll be okay as long as a third of my startups lose money, a third break even, and a third makes money    tony robbins   wouldn t it be nice if life worked that way?  tim ferris   doesn t it work that way?  tony robbins   no, it does not   tim ferris   whereas the guys who are really good realize that there is a power law distribution  one or two of their investments are going to make up for all of the losses, and they very top of the top   even though they don t talk about it publicly   if they have a lot of their personal money at play   have thought a lot about asset allocation  if they re heavily vested in tech, and it might have an ipo   blah, blah, blah   they have an entire basket of shorts on the nasdaq or whatever it might be so that, by the way, it s not always high risk, high reward  if their tech goes to hell, they have enough money that is betting it s going to go to hell that they don t lose a lot of money   if at all   or maybe they even make money   tony robbins   that s absolutely true   tim ferris   so i think the    tony robbins   a way of it doing it that you mentioned   i think you re a brave man  i ve been going this direction  maybe i m wrong, but ray dalio actually said something in there that stuck with me brutally  he said,  i don t care what it is that you think you re great at investing in or you like  ,  most people invest in what they like   real estate or stocks or bonds or what they think they re good at or what they were raised with  he said,  whatever asset class you invest in, i promise you, in your lifetime, it will drop no less than 50 and more likely 70 percent at some point  that is why you absolutely must diversify   because you re saying,  but i can make so much more on this side   i ve had people throughout the years   i teach this bucket  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    theory, this idea that  inaudible  asset allocation simple  it sounds like such a big word  it s just buckets  some of my money is going to go in a secure bucket  that bucket is like a church steeple  it s not going away  it s very secure type investments  its upside is not gigantic in terms of speed, but you know what, the compounding process, if you give it enough time, those low returns are giant returns still, but you re not going to lose  and then there s this bucket called   what most people call a growth bucket, i call it risk growth because it s really risk first  on that, i m taking bigger risks for potentially greater rewards  now, the question is, how do i balance these? am i 60 40, 50 50, 80 20, and that s designed, really, by three things, no  1, what s your real risk tolerance, not what you think it is? tim ferris   yeah, and they re never the same   tony robbins   they re never the same  i do these wealth mastering programs through the years, and invariably, i do some crazy thing like i ll say,  everybody stand up, make change   they look at me and go,  make change,  and they start reaching in their pockets and making change  somebody will pull out  5 00 and  10 00  somebody pulled out  100 00, and someone will come up and they ll take it and give them  5 00  they re like   they don t know how to react  this goes on for three or four music  the music s going on  i go,  okay, stop, sit down,  and i go on like i m talking about something else  invariable, somebody s like,  hey, wait a second  i want my  100 00 back   i said,  well, what are you talking about?  they said,  i want my  100 00 back  the game s over  i said,  why d you think the game is over?  didn t think the game had ever gone over  and who said it was your  100 00  it takes a while before they finally get,  i m stressed about  100 00   what do you think s going to happen when you lose  1 million or a half a million or  100,000 00 or  10,000 00? your risk tolerance is not what you think it is  so when you find out what your risk tolerance is   and we ve got great ways to do that in the book   and then you figure out, really, how much time do you have? when you re younger, you got more time to make mistakes, and so you can take bigger risks  you ve got timeline on your  inaudible   and then the next piece is, how much is your cash flow? what s going to be the   if you look at those three things, now you can decide how much goes in my secure bucket and how much goes in my growth, and if you  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    don t make that decision, it s the most important investment decision of your life, according to everybody i interviewed  like, what percentage is secure? what percentage is growth and risk? then, when things come up, you re always going to go for the growth risks  it looks so sexy and exciting, and i can t tell you how many people over the years have done this  they re telling me,  why would i put money over here when i ve got this real estate, and i m making 120 percent   i have a friend that built some of the first big condos in vegas back in the boom time, and he actually went to my programs, sold the business  he had made  200 million, invested in these condos, started building the panorama towers and places of that nature, and he was up to like three quarters of a billion  i kept saying to him,  dude, take some of your growth money and put it in the secure bucket  how many times have i told you this?  he goes,  tony, i love you  i made  200 million  inaudible , but now what i touch goes to gold   i m listening to this and i m going,  i love you brother, but do you know how many times i ve had this conversation,  and then guess what happens in 2008? how much do you think he lost? he was worth three quarters of a billion dollars  he had grown that rapidly in those short years  what do you think happened to his net worth? tim ferris   oh, i m guessing it went down, according to the ray dalio prediction   tony robbins   how about minus  400 million  he didn t just lose what he had  he lost everything out and beyond  so then he s trying to negotiate     crosstalk  tim ferris   he was leveraged    tony robbins   he was leveraged out  he wiped himself out  most people don t put enough in the security bucket is the lesson, and a guy like dalio provides you a strategy that s got great sustainability, but there are many approaches in the book  but you do have to decide how much is secure, how much is growth, and i show you how to do that in the book   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferris   i would emphasize at least   i would be curious to hear your thoughts, tony, but for me, it took me a long time to realize what investing represents for me, and it s not maximizing return  it s maximizing quality of life, and there s a big difference   tony robbins   yes   tim ferris   for me, at least, i have a very kind of barbell strategy where i have super, super safe stuff and then the startup stuff, but i need to modify that  i want to modify that because it s not currently all seasons at all  for people out there, i think, who might say,  oh, i don t want to think about it,  i would just emphasize that you re making decisions every day about where you allocate your time, your money, your resources, so whether or not you want to call yourself and investor, you are an investor   tony robbins   totally true   tim ferris   if you make no decision, that s also a decision  it s important to become literate, i think, with a lot of these basic concepts, which is not difficult   tony robbins    inaudible  about that  people need to remember that everybody s a financial trader, but most people are making a bad trade because they re trading time for money  worst trade of your life because you can t get more time  we all know it  what this book will do, if you re willing to just give yourself a chapter a day for month or go crazy on a weekend, you ll go from maybe not even knowing what these terms sound so complex to being juiced because you ll be an insider  you will look at the world in a totally different way  you ll go,  that is the biggest rip off on earth  that won t ever happen to me  that is where i want to go   make some decisions, and then it s not an everyday thing  literally, you might do your rebalancing once a year for 15 minutes, unless you re going to be a trader every day  this shouldn t dominate your life  when did you give yourself the initial education about one of the most important areas of your life? there s only few areas that really impact the quality of your life   your body, your emotions, your relationships, your finances, your career or your business, the spiritual side of your life, and how you use your time   about a half or dozen, maybe seven areas that really affect you, but most people major in minor things  they know so much more about shit that doesn t matter  i m saying to people, give yourself a gift of just a short burst of time so  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    that you can truly look at life and be good at this area, and then if you want somebody to do it for you, you can, but at least then you lead them  you re not being led by them  tim ferris   no, definitely, and i think that just like   one of the things that changed my world in startup investing was any company you invest in should be able to return the fund, just as a general   the amount of money that you re investing however x number of years  just like the  1 00 to  5 00 principle with tudor jones, and there are a couple of pithy heuristics, like rules of thumb that i think will change how you view not just money or stocks, but the world in general, such as, assume in the dalio case that your favorite area, your pet investment bucket is going to decrease by at least 50 percent in the next x period of    tony robbins   50 to 70     crosstalk  tim ferris   even better   tony robbins   70 will get your attention even more   tim ferris   yeah, that ll get your attention   and plan accordingly  i think that   yeah, it s been a very fun process to read this and also to connect with you over it  let me ask, if i could, because i know you ve got a lot planned, and i also want to finish up the last few interviews in the book, reading the ones that you did  i m curious if there are any particular funny stories, or what was the funniest story or interaction you had while researching and writing this book that comes to mind?  tony robbins   well, i think i shared one of them already, i think, is the   funny now  it wasn t funny in the moment is walking in carl icahn s office so excited, so prepared, ready to rip open   because this guy, he s got the greatest returns of anybody out there  very few people know that  i kept going over to the first review that really shoed all the numbers  if you would ve invested in him in 1968, you d have a 31 percent compounded return within his firm versus at buffet s firm, you d have a 20 percent return  people think of buffet as the ultimate guy  i got all the facts, figures, i m excited, and to have him literally throwing my video crew out the door and then telling me now audio, i m like,  how the hell am i going to keep up with this guy?  inaudible  notes, so that ll be one   a fun moment was introducing carl icahn to jack  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    vogel  they didn t know each other, and they re fans of each other  i came from being an outside to now introducing them  most of the time with these guys, it wasn t as much funny as it was fascinating  it was just seeing the level of the   they play the game  it s like with a great poker player  they know the psychology  they know the numbers  they know the probability, and you just realize why most people are never going to win because they re not going to win gold medals against these guys that are playing this game day and night, night and day  some of that isn t new to me just because paul s been my dearest friend for 21 years now  but it s fascinating to see that in every industry and every sport, there are a few players that play at the highest level, and they have one thing in common above all else   hunger  it s an unquenchable hunger  you have that hunger  i see that in you  that s why i m a fan of your work  you re going to keep finding the answer  it doesn t matter what answer you got  i want to know more  every one of these people has that, and it s fun to be around them because there s energy in every one of these people  they have different styles, but there s an energy, and that energy is driven by that desire, that hunger to know more  tim ferris   the other observation that was reinforced by reading the book was that they also have principles   tony robbins   no doubt   tim ferris   they have operating systems    tim ferris   without a doubt   tim ferris   that they use, and whether you are trying to lose weight, trying to quit smoking, trying to improve your investment returns, you can ensure against your lesser instincts by having a system    tony robbins   that s right   tim ferris   and putting systems in place so that when you have the impulses that are going to lead to your destruction or eating a cupcake when you shouldn t eat it, that you can mitigate against that, and it s possible you can set these things up in advance  i would love to, before we wrap up, just ask a couple of rapid fire questions   tony robbins   sure, go for it   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferris   okay  when you think of the word successful, who s the first person that comes to mind?  tony robbins   gosh, i like richard branson  i know why that s the first thing that popped in my head when you said that, only because i think he lives so passionately  he lives life on his terms  there s no bullshit with him  he s having a good time  he s close to his family  lives on an island like i do  inaudible , but extraordinarily leverage and very conscious man about society and what to do  his  inaudible  program and things like that  he s very social conscious, and yet, still has a great time  he d be one of the first people i d think of probably   tim ferris   what have you changed your mind about over the years, any positions you ve taken that you ve reversed since?  tony robbins   you don t have to be perfect in everything you do, including not eating anything enjoyable  that d probably be a big one my wife would tell you  gosh, you know, over the years, you re always updating  i don t look at it as changing as much as updating and informing myself  if you thought of it as changing, i d think you d find resistance within your own conscientious or your own identity  identity plays such a strong wall, the need to be consistent with what you believe, and that s why the political system s so messed up  somebody can actually grow, and they re seen as inconsistent   tim ferris   yeah  oh, it s a mess   tony robbins   it makes the political system not grow  it makes the system locked in place  i don t think there s anything that comes to mind just real directly, but i think there s a constant upgrading, and sometimes it s those two millimeter upgrades that provide the biggest impact   tim ferris   side note for folks, it s also common among the top venture capitalists and investors, mark andreson, who created the graphical web browser, one of his mottos for  inaudible  is strong opinions weakly held  he s ready to be corrected or updated, as you mentioned  what would people be surprised to know about you?  tony robbins   oh, gosh  you should ask my wife that question  i don t know  some people would not be surprised at all  people in my events   i m a love bug   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    i m the kind of guy that i can be brought to tears by seeing someone do the right thing, and yet i ll run through that wall, shake the building with 10,000 people in it  i m a softie really, truly underneath it all  that s what drives all this in me  i love to see people lit up  i love to see people happy  i love to see people freed  tim ferris   i m going to ask an unusual one, given that answer  what s the first face that comes to mind when you think punchable?  tony robbins   punchable, oh, my gosh  well, i had an interesting meeting with president obama  it was actually interesting  i was invited by mark benioff to come  it was for 15 billionaires there in silicon valley  i was in san jose, and it was for the president  it was before the second election   his re election  i voted for the president, so i m a fan of the president, but i was getting more and more frustrated by watching the style of politics, which was creating a greater and greater division, and it seemed to me a great level inaccuracy, and the promises being made that are very hard not to see  at that time, it was the whole thing, we re going to raise taxes on the rich, and that s going to balance the budget  i ve done the numbers  i did a whole video on it  it shows you can kill every risk person in the united states and take all their money and take all the corporations and all the advertising from the super bowl   i do this whole long gig that came from some statistics another man put together for me, but i did it together, and you can t cover the budget for one year, and then what do you do next year? i said to mark, i said,  listen, i ve supported the president, but honestly, i don t know if i can support the other side, but i don t know that i m a guy to be there  i don t know if i m a fan   i said,  mark, you and i are so aligned on so much, but the way in which,    how simpson bowles was this close, and he let it pass  we had both sides willing to make some tough decisions is beyond me  it lacks the leadership that, fundamentally, the president of the united states, in my mind has to have it  that s my judgement  i m just a person, but it s like, i don t understand  taking the easy route is not something that s going to sustain or grow this economy long terms  and using the political capitol, even though i m supportive of healthcare, using that healthcare where half the country is upset about it and pushing it down their throat and trying to say it s going to cost less money is just like   there s certain things that   so mark says,  i agree with you  i agree with you,  and mark is the  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    second largest fundraiser for the president  i said,  well, then how the hell do you raise all that money?  he goes,  well, because i feel stronger about him than the other guy, and you and i are aligned with him on so many other things about the environment and people s right to marriage regardless of sexual preference   i said,  of course we are   he said,  come  come and be there   i said,  you know me  i m totally respectful, but i m honest   he goes,  come  i ll sit you right next the president, and we ll have a great conversation   so i went to this meeting, and it was crazy  i ve worked with so many presidents over the year, but i have not with obama, and it s downtown san jose  they locked everybody in their buildings and literally, it looked like in one of those movies, you know everybody s died, and there s nothing left but the buildings  it was the wildest thing for several blocks  took us up in this room  there s nobody else  inaudible   there s these 16 people, many of which you know from silicon valley, and i listened, and the president came in and was really wonderful, and he shared some comments and said,  i m not here to give a speech  you guys have built the biggest companies in the world,  and i m thinking,  not me  i don t  fit that category   and so i wasn t going to say anything, and he said,  but i really want to hear from you guys   so mark turns to him and says,  well, are you ready for some real give and take, mr  president?  he says,  yeah   and he goes,  okay, who wants to go first?  and he points straight at me  tim ferris   that s what friends are for  i said,  mr  president,  i paused   i literally paused  i thought, i shouldn t do this  i m not here  they both paid a quarter million bucks to be here   i actually remember doing this before   i went,  thousand one, thousand ,  trying to see if somebody else is going to say something   inaudible  he said,  okay, so, well, mr  president  i really want you to know i voted for you  i know you re man of tremendous integrity  i share the same values you do, i believe, but i m really confused about two things  no  1, how you think you ll be able to have a second four year run and get anything done when you have taken the underside and demonized them to a point that they re never going to work with you  and my second questions, if i ever get one would be, why didn t you support simpson bowles? i said,  it was right there  it needed to be done   long pause, and he said,  well, those are fair questions,  and he said,  first of all, i don t think i ve ever  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    demonized the other party, ever   and i just sat there, and i watched him say it, and it was like,  are you kidding me? i m not republican, but come on   both sides have demonized  ,  and he goes,  they ve been really unfair to me,  and he went through this piece, and i said,  mr  president, that s happened with every president, to be fair  that s what they both do, and it s gotten worse throughout the years, for sure  what about simpson bowels?  and he says,  well, tony,  and he  inaudible  about who s in the room, the president knew, and he goes,  well, tony, you know, your hedge fund friends, they wouldn t like it if we got rid of the 15 percent tax  inaudible    and he goes,  you know, most americans wouldn t like it if they got rid of their mortgage deduction and all those things  i got a better plan   and i said,  the better plan is you re going to raise taxes back to bush, on the wealthy, and it takes  4 billion a day to run this country, and you know as well as i do the estimates have all got money in, won t even cover three months of this government s spending, so it won t solve anything  you re going to have to raise taxes on everyone to cover this  how do you deal with that?  and so he and i went back and forth, and to be fair, i m telling my version of the story  i m sure he d give a different version of the story  but there was a point where i felt i m losing rapport with every person in this room, but i had to be honest  finally, at one point,  inaudible  came over and grab my wrist, and he said,  i think that s enough   and the president s   i didn t raise my voice  the president s   honor him  he said,  no, tony s created some creative tension here  i m not used to that in these rooms, but it s a fair question   i said,  you know, president, i just want to know because i voted for you, and a lot of people i know voted for you, and i don t know if they will again  i don t know if they need to  you re going to win anyway  but i d really love to know what to tell them about how you re going to govern with this level of division   at the end, i just said,  well, thank you for your time,  and then everybody else got up and asked the questions like,  will you give a shout to the jews,  and things like that  there were no hardballs in there at all, but you know, it s a political environment  afterwards, i thought,  oh, my god, everybody s going to hate me,  and then reid hoffman walks up to me from linkedin and says,  i can t believe you asked him that question  i can t believe copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    you asked him about it  i ve been wanting to ask him that question forever   inaudible  on you,  and i got all these people coming up to me giving me   and then the president came around, and when he came back around, he went to shake everybody s hand  he shakes my hand  i shook his hand, and i grabbed him with both hands, and i pulled him close to me, and i said,  mr  president, i m not some stupid republican who s just looking for some tax break  this week, i fed had a quarter of a million people in san jose, and i don t live here  i came here to do an event  this is what i do wherever i go  i came from nothing, and i don t forget where i ve come from  i care as much as you care, but i m really concerned about your ability to get your agenda done in the next season of your career if you don t find a way to bridge your communication style with these people   intelligence is not enough  you ve got to build relationship,  and he stared at me, and he said,  how about you  inaudible  chief of staff and you come visit me at the white house, you and i, one on one for an hour   i was blown away  i thought i didn t reach him at all  it was mindboggling  mark was right there  he goes,  that was unbelievable  that was  inaudible   i loved that  i loved seeing that  that energy back and forth, and you can  inaudible    so then about a week later, they were getting ready for these debates, and the other side called me and asked me if i work with their particular candidate privately, and i m not one sided or the other  i want to see a debate that s real  so i worked with mr  romney, and that s the first debate they went in, and he did pretty well, and my invitation was no longer extended  i wouldn t say punch in the mouth, but i d say frustrated because here s a man who has such integrity   president of the united states   and i think a classic human being who cares deeply, smart as a whip, but the failure to find a way to bridge compromise is both sides  responsibility  but in my mind, as a citizen, the president of the united states has got to make that happen, and there are presidents who have done that and presidents that haven t, and i think that s not his fault, but we re at an impasse, politically, that is not allowing us to do the things that i think are necessary for   put our house in order in this country, and easy for an outside to see it, but as a citizen, we all have our right to our opinions  so i don t know if i d say punch, but shake him  tim ferris   metaphorically   yeah, right   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tony robbins   i think that might be more of a better one   tim ferris   wow, that s a hell of a story  one last question, and i think people are really going to enjoy this, and i can t wait to see the comments and questions also  i have my moments of doubt   dark moments  i don t know if you have those moments of doubt in yourself anymore    tony robbins   no, never   tim ferris   never?  tony robbins   i m human   tim ferris   what do you do when you have those dips, when you have those down moments and doubts?  tony robbins   those moments, i ve experienced primarily when i ve found an inner conflict that s hard to resolve, and that has been in the past when i m traveling around the world, i feel like i m made to do what i do as a human being   i m certainly not the only human being that can help people, but i m able to help a lot of people, and i feel it s a privilege, and it s a gift, and it s something that s earned and something that is part of grace  yet, the greatest thing in my life outside of my work and my family is my wife  ironically, when i met her, she had extreme motion sickness since birth, and i spent almost a decade going everywhere because she would throw up on   we never wanted to be a part, and she would throw up on the flight up and on the flight down, and she literally lost   i don t know   it was 19 pounds, which she couldn t lose  she was a size zero  i took her to every type of physician  i took her to every kind of natural healer, acupuncturist  i took her to nasa   the expert there   nobody s able to help her  i took her to the guy who works with the top gun pilots because if they lose their vestibular system, they re dead  so he had this system, and he was the only one that could help her maybe 10 percent of the time not throw up, but the process she did   this tightening of her body   created constriction in her lymph fluid, and she developed a tumor  the darkest days when i think i m made here to do, and it s hurting the person i love most, or i ve got to be apart  as corny as it sounds, i just believe that there was a larger lesson that i need to find a way to breakthrough, and  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    we finally did, and she doesn t love motion, but she no longer throws up on any flight  it was ironically an experience in india, which sounds so bogus to me, but i experienced  she s never thrown up since that time  it s mindboggling  it s this man who really doesn t   he s not of any particular faith  it s called oneness, and he does this form of meditation work where it basically primes your brain to a certain way of being, and it balanced her body out  it s just amazing  the point of the matter is i went through all this pain, all this questioning, all this doubt, but i kept asking,  what s right, what s really,  and i trusted my gut even when it was painful to trust my gut  i ve found that that s probably the most useful thing  the other thing you ve got to do is   it sounds stupid  hydrate your ass off  make sure you rest because in a lowered state of energy, you ll doubt everything, and the worst thing can happen  if you are what i call energy rich, if you are physiologically at a peak, you can slam anything against you, and you ll know  that s not to say you won t have those downs, but that s what i try to do  put my body back in the strongest place  that ll put your mind back there  your heart is always there, and then ask, what s right, and live it  you re still going to make mistakes, and when you do, i think it s forgiving yourself and learning from it and moving the hell on to what s next as quickly as you can so that that experience allows you to help other people  for me, the worst events i ve ever gone through in my life have always been the best events because i ve figured if i m experiencing this, someone else is too, and if i figure out, i can help millions of people  that s given me sanity so i don t have to deal with my pain or bullshit or whatever the case may be  that s a big part of my life, which is ending suffering, which is impossible, but ending it in areas of people s life is possible  it s like they always say   it s corny   suffering is optional pain  everybody s got pain in their life, but suffering is optional, and i really believe i can help people get out of that, and more importantly than get out of the suffering is to give them an experience of more of the joy that s already inside them, and i live to see that light in their eyes, i m going to look forward to seeing you at some point at an event because you ll have an have experience of it  it won t be this discussion  discussion is wonderful  experience is ten times better  i always tell people a belief is a poor substitute for copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    an experience  you can believe all you want about what you think is or investing is or what china s like  go to china  get in the experience  go to the event  then you ll know  i m a big guy  i put people in the experience as they quick as they can, and i let their spirit and their heart and their soul take over, and that s what my life is about  tim ferris   tony robbins   that s a good mission  that s an amazing mission  where can people learn more about the book, more about you? where would you like them to visit you? i ll give you an address, but they can go to tonyrobbins com  that s the easiest way, and the book, again, is called money master the game, seven simple steps to financial freedom, and what ll i do is i ll give you a site  if people decide to do this, and they go to amazon, if they ll send me their receipt, i will give them something i did for people during the prepublication period, which is i made three videos that are a fast track   so if somebody s going like,  six hundred pages seems like a lot to me,  well, this will get you going  i think for a lot of people, the audio video approach is a god approach for them, and it ll take them deeper in the book, but i do want you to know that most people   i don t know if you experienced this   but most people who read the book are entertained because it isn t just some heavy factual piece  it takes you on a journey, and it s a journey through the financial world, which is wild, weird, crazy stuff happening  it s a journey into the lives of people that started with nothing that are the wealthiest people in the world and how they did it, and it s your own journey about where you re going to take yourself from this point on and how you want to live that life and experiences that you want to not only have for yourself, but what you really want to give  that s the greatest thing  i look back, and i think about money  money is nothing but a tool that you either use for a life of service and to increase the quality of life for yourself and the people you love, or it s used on you as a weapon  i m big on saying,  time for it to no longer be a weapon used against you,  and the only way to do that is educate yourself, and you can do it in a way that s really fun, and that s what this is   tim ferris   oh, absolutely  guys, check out the book  check out tony  tony, you ve had a huge impact on my life, and just to the entertainment  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    aspect of the book, i have tons of books sent to me   dozens a week   as i m sure you do   huge stack  a lot of the questions that i asked did not require me to read the book, and i ended up pushing off probably a half dozen important projects of mine because i got pulled into the book  i remember i e mailed you and i said,  you know, in 20 years, you still have it  hot damn,  that feeling, the tony robbins response that i had reading your material back in high school  i remember you e mailed me, and you re like,  high school? how old are you? it s a really fascinating read, and i know some of you listening are my friends who are deep in the world of finance  you will find things, whether it s in the interviews at the back, the profiles from the top performers over the last several decades, or within  it s a really fascinating romp with lots of good stories  so tony, thank you so much for taking the time  tony robbins   thanks for coming down  great to meet you in person, finally   tim ferris   definitely  hope it s not the last  thanks   tony robbins   all right,  inaudible  brother  thank you   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    "
170,178,Tony Robbins – On Achievement Versus Fulfillment (#178),"'tony robbins is the world s most famous performance coach  for those of you who don t know the name, he s advised everyone from bill clinton to serena williams, from leo dicaprio to oprah, who calls him  super human,  world leaders like gorbachev, it just goes on and on  in this particular episode, we talk about a number of topics we didn t cover in the previous interview ''we also drill into some new rapid fire questions  so, for instance, his best investment he s ever made, quotes that he lives by, worst advice that he hears or sees being given out regularly, why he s changed his diet for the first time since he was about 17, i believe  we also go into some very specific exercises  there s a portion in the middle where tony is effectively on his own  i just let him go for a good, i d say, 30 to 40 minutes  if you want a very specific exercise that you can apply in real time, because he walks me through it and i dug in because i could use it, today specifically, i was having a very rough day, called the 90 second rule ''it s a process and he brings up a personal challenging experience that he had not long ago in dallas and then walks through exactly how he contended with it  it s from roughly 1 05 after this introduction ends to 1 15  so 1 05 to 1 15, roughly  we get into a very nice flow  i also have to recommend that you check out the brand new documentary out about tony robbins, which digs into one of his events called i am not your guru ''you can find it on netflix  i saw it before it came out and found it exactly powerful  there s a good chance you will find yourself laughing and crying at different points  i m not much of a crier, so that should tell you something  check it out  i am not your guru on netflix  without further ado, please enjoy this follow up conversation with tony robbins ''tony, welcome back to the show ''tony robbins  thanks for having me on, tim  good to hear your voice  good to hear your voice too  and i ve been thinking about you a lot  i ve gathered questions as follow ups and i ve taken some from fans  part of the reason i ve been asking myself about you is because i ve been wondering what would tony robbins do in certain circumstances i m finding myself in  i ll give you a perfect example  today, i m on book deadline right now and it rolls around to around 3 00 p m  and it s just one of those days where i haven t felt like my brain has been connected to the rest of my body and i haven t really done anything ''i m on book deadline, a very crunch book deadline  and for whatever reason, words just are not really very intelligible on the page  and that led me to want to ask you   a lot of my fans have asked this   does tony have bad days? and if you do find yourself in a situation like this where you ve tried the priming and for whatever reason, it s like the mid afternoon and you re like, wow, i really don t think i ve gotten much done today  if that happens, what do you do? what is the internal monologue or the self talk?''tony robbins  i know that trying to think my way through it is not going to do squat  of course i have those days and those times  i don t have days like that  i pretty rarely have a day like that, but if i feel it happening and i catch myself within a few hours, then i do something radical with my body because the body will change the mind the fastest ''you have to find that sense of energy and passion and intensity back inside yourself of what makes you go  what i would do if it was my situation, i d immediately do something either really hot or really cold   those two extremes  or go for a run or go lift  anything that s going to pump the blood through me  but my first run would be jump in that freezing ass water that i always have nearby or jump in a cryotherapy because like i tell you, when you drop your temperature down to  220 f and you will have a whole new mental state, that s for sure ''but really, truly, it s getting physical in some intense, dramatic way that shifts the physiology and that s what s going to shift your mind and then the creativity comes in  once i ve made that shift, then i d focus on coming back to not the deadline, to my reasons, the why, right? i know you do as well  just what am i doing this for? get reassociated  what am i most passionate about?''i won t read, write, speak, or do anything  maybe read, but i won t write or speak about something i m not totally passionate about  so if i m not feeling it because my body is just thrashed, i ve been burning the candle at both ends, which is common, that s when i ve got to do something physical to shift it, to make that happen  but when i do those two things, it usually flows  i bet it would be for you too  i remember years ago, i worked with john denver popped in my head just now  he was stuck in every way, couldn t write a damn thing  he was very frustrated ''i just took him through three of his greatest songs he d ever done and as he walked through the songs, i said,  i want you to describe to me the moments that were coming through you   in all three of his examples, he was either skiing or he d gone on a run or done something and then boom, he was in this state where he was in this flow state again  i remember i did that for him and then i started doing it for myself ever since that time  and do you still travel with a small trampoline?''tony robbins  yes, i don t travel with it, but i   you don t have it  ''tony robbins  i have an army of goodies that go place to place, yes  and how do you use that? how do you typically use the trampoline?''tony robbins  i do it because most people know you have more   your lymph in your body   there s four times more lymph than there is blood  the lymph is the detoxification system in your body  when you re feeling tired or exhausted or lethargic, outside of sleep and hydration and then food, it s really making sure that lymph system is moving  so i jump on that thing for 10, 12 minutes first thing in the morning and get my lymph moving  especially if i don t have the cold nearby  if i can t   if i don t have a cold plunge or something, i m in a hotel, then my next piece is to lymphacize for 12 minutes and it s just amazing  you get all that lactic acid out of your body moving and you feel like a different person  you mentioned john denver  of course, i ve seen your documentary, which is quite the buzz at the moment and we re going to talk a lot more about that  i wanted to ask   and a few fans also asked about this   if you think back, is there a particular intervention that was particularly difficult and what made it difficult and how did you handle it?''tony robbins  oh gosh   there have been so many particularly difficult ones  or are there characteristics that make particular interventions difficult?''tony robbins  i remember one in particular  i don t know why this one flashes in my mind  i don t know if i ve ever shared this with you  we ve talked a few times  but it was a really big deal  it was my date with destiny  it was the first time i brought any reporters in to see this  this is, gosh, 20 years ago maybe  i always read  i think you know i read  people do 10 to 20 pages of homework  i read it all  now it takes a couple weeks to read it all  i don t remember what everybody s name, but that information is in me so i m ready  i ve done this and diane sawyer was coming with her crew to kind of just do a brief filming and show all these incredible ceo types that we re changing their lives and redesigning their destiny ''in the middle of this experience, and it was on day one, this woman kept trying to get my attention, i felt  i don t reward that, right? i m happy to do it if it s not for attention  if it s for help  but this woman it was clear  so i ignored it, ignored it  all of a sudden, she just exploded, ignited, and started saying,  i m going to kill you! i m going to kill you!  and she had her hand like she was stabbing at people  people were running from her, going totally berserk  then i saw who she was  i saw the dynamic of what was going on  instantly i realized who she was ''she was woman who had 50   she was one of the first people with multiple personality disorders, mpds they call them   one of the first diagnosed ones when they first came up with the title of this  she had been institutionalized  her story was so brutal because her father had been sexually abusing her for a good portion of her life and she finally told somebody and he had her institutionalized  people that i guess were his friends ''the doctor there actually sexually abused her  he would drug her and sexually abuse her  so you can only imagine going inside your head where there s pain no matter what, you re out of control  we all have to find a way to survive  we have to find a way to meet our fundamental needs for certainty, for variety, for god s sake, when you re being trapped  for feeling like you have some significant control over your life  for the feeling of connection or love or growth or contribution  these are human needs that have to be found in our life for us to feel like we can function  so if we can t find them in good ways, we ll find them in bad ways ''and her way was to just change personalities  that s one way to get out of pain  if you re being viciously attacked and you re out of control, try to become someone else  she kept doing it and doing it  long story shortened, she s screaming, doing this, people are freaking out  all of a sudden, she starts talking like a little girl and then like an old man  it looked like something out of exorcist  in the middle of all this, i just let her go and go and go  i finally just said to her, i said,  you know, i understand you re in a lot of pain and i just want you to know that i know who you are and i know what you ve been through  ''then i told the room the story of what she d been through while she stood there with her mouth opening, just gaped open  i said,  so i want you to know that i know you believe you re all these personalities, but,  i said  there s probably a reason you re here   i said,  i think the reason you re here is because changing personalities was a brilliant solution for you to survive in those situations and you had to keep more and more personalities but you kept doing it so much, now you re out of the institution, but you re still living in pain  ''i said,  the problem is you must be here because at some level, you know this isn t working because no one can love someone when they don t know who they re going to be next   it just grabbed her  i found her internal need  then as i started working with her she would jump back because she wanted control  she would try to do something  she would say,  i m going to pee on this chair   and i said,  you pee on that chair, i ll slap you across this room   she wasn t ready for that piece  obviously, i m not going to do it, i m just using the shock factor  i said,  i m not some stupid psychiatrist you can play these games with  ''i said,  i know who the fuck you are and you know who you are deep inside   i said,  all the stuff was brilliant, brilliant adaption that helped you survive but now it s separating you from everyone  it s causing you to feel the deepest pain   i said,  i think it s brilliant you have so many personalities  children have lots of personalities  you say, i m superman  no, i m batman  i m superman and batman  you can do all that stuff when you re a kid   i said,  when you re an adult and you saw that shit, people want to lock you up   i said,  you re probably great with children   she looked at me and she goes,  i am great with children  ''and you watch her going in and out  so anyway, this is an hour and a half process i m trying to tell in two minutes, but the bottom line in the end is the way i finally kicked her over the edge  she says,  i was one of the first mpds   i said,  i know, and they re so god damned common now aren t they?  because i knew her biggest need was to be significant  she was defeating all the psychiatrists  she wanted to be   the significant drive needed to be met more than any other drive for her on the surface  what she needed more was love  so i used the significance drive ''i said,  yeah, it s so common  i mean, mpds are a dime a dozen  there s nothing unique about them at all   you could just see her face just drop  i just took it all away  and then i turned around and i said,  but, you know,  and the cameras are rolling by the way, so what i m not telling you is inside my gut when this first starts, i m like, are you kidding me? this woman is splitting personalities and being a freak in the middle of them filming here? they re going to be like, this is who comes to tony robbins  seminars? i got the room full of ceos, you know, marc benioff from salesforce and billionaires and this woman is taking away my entire ability to reach people is what ran through my head ''but i let go of that and just worked on her  but at the end, the cameras are still rolling and i said,  look, they re a dime a dozen, but  i said,  i don t think there s ever been anyone in history that s ever had 52 personalities or even two and who integrated in a matter of two minutes or less on national television    but  i said,  i don t think you re capable of that   it was just the perfect double bind  she went through all these conversions in her face  anyway, long story short, she transformed ''then all i did for the next four days was catch her and show her  i said,  listen, you know, anyone can forget things  certainly, we ve all had the skill of forgetting your keys  when you go from place to place to place and then you find them in the place you ve been looking for the fifth time through   i said,  forgetting can also be a skill   and then i just helped her along the way to let go of all of those personalities  and the beauty of it and the reason i think it was powerful was they didn t do that story for a year because they wanted to see what happened with her ''a year later, she was still clear and when diane sawyer interviewed her psychiatrist, she said,  it s just a miracle  i can t explain it  it s just a miracle   because she never split again  so that would be a fairly dramatic example  but, you know, i ve gotten the call, as you know, president clinton in the middle of the night saying,  they re going to impeach me  what should i do?  i got a chance to work with princess diana to help her clarify what she really wanted to do to make one of the biggest decisions in her life in british history  i ve had a ticket to history ''i ve had the chance to be with mr  gorbachev and really hear what ended the cold war directly and the sit down with him and president bush sr  at that time and mitterand and meg thatcher and sit in like a fly on the wall in those conversations ''there have just been some amazing times in this life that i ve been privileged to witness and be a part of and sometimes influence  i view you as an expert question asker  a crafter of questions as a way of   not manipulating, that s not the right word   but changing though or changing thought patterns  if you could ask all of the past podcast guests that i ve had one question, what would that question be? i know it s an odd  ''tony robbins  first, i would never ask one question  i think you know me well enough to know   somebody counted one time  i was at an event and there was this woman who was suicidal and someone counted and i asked 167 questions before i ever said anything  of that one person?''tony robbins  of that one person, right  she was a person that was completely shut down, suicidal, non responsive  so i would never ask one question  but the line of questioning would depend on the person ''i m always fascinated by what is the drive that makes someone the best of who they are? what is the uncovering? what is the piece that triggers that? i usually ask people a question like, whose love did you crave the most growing up? your mother or your father? i m sure you loved them both the most, but whose love did you crave the most? whose love did you crave the most?''tim ferriss  oh, you re asking me?''tony robbins  yeah  probably my dad, i would say  yeah, i would say so  i had a very deep relationship with my mom  and i felt close to my dad in a lot of ways, but it was a different relationship ''tony robbins  yeah  who did you have to be for your father? if you had a first gut reaction without even thinking? just no filters  i had to be  ?''tim ferriss  i had to be   that s a good question  man  it s pretty rare that i get stumped on my own podcast ''tony robbins  that s good  because this is deep in your unconscious  because the reason that i m asking this question is   and i ll give you a moment or two to think   what controls our life is our model of the world  so our model of the world is we all have to have a set of beliefs, a set of values, a set of rules, how you should be, how i should be, how life should be  and, of course, life doesn t always match that, which is where people get stressed out  thinking that all their preferences should be met  but if you understand the driving force of your whole life comes because when you re first born, you re wide open  you can be anything ''a child can do anything  you can laugh, you can cry, you can scream, you can throw stuff, you can go to the bathroom in your pants  try that when you re 40 see if it works  the whole thing changes because you learn from the source of love you crave the most, from both sources of love, you learn how you need to be  you learn it by what they tell you or what they don t tell you  what you inherently make up in your mind based upon what you witness  so just tell me the first gut response  first gut response is, from my father i needed to be    to have his respect  to have his love  i think to have his love and his respect  the first thing that comes to mind is maybe obedient is not the right adjective, but accepting of whatever his instructions were, effectively ''tony robbins  interesting  as you know of me, also, when you said i would never ask one question, well, i m pretty prone to asking barrages of questions and i felt like that created a lot of friction ''tony robbins  with him?''tim ferriss  i wanted to ask why a thousand times in a row before i would  ''tony robbins  and that wasn t acceptable? he wanted you to accept what he said?''tim ferriss  yeah, i would say it was a frequent source of conflict ''tony robbins  interesting  and what else did you have to be besides you had to accept his view, to some extent  or not question it or not ask too many questions? what else did you have to be?''tim ferriss  what are   well, let me ask   let me flip this around  i m buying myself some time  how do you dissect  ''tony robbins  well, let me ask you about your mom? let me ask that question  what about your mom? out of curiosity, who did you have to be for your mom?''tim ferriss  i didn t feel like i needed to be anyone for my mom  she was very good at exposing me to many different things  we didn t have a lot of money, but she would expose us to whether it was particular books or say going to the beach and gathering black sand with magnets  whatever it might be, she would expose us to a lot of different stimuli and then if we became passionate about something, she would, to the extent that she could, support that ''so i felt like it was very my marching to my own drummer was perfectly acceptable and wherever i ended up, as long as i was happy, was a perfectly fine destiny, so to speak  i never felt like i had to be anyone in particular for my mom, i don t think ''tony robbins  which is also why you didn t crave her love, you see? we crave the love that we feel like we didn t get as much of and it affects our unconscious  so your pathway of your life of experimentation and feeling like it s not only something that is good, it s something that could be great, it sounds like it started with those experiences with your mother  your mother of anxiety, wherever you would feel them would come from the experiences with your father because you couldn t win  follow?''tim ferriss  yeah, i do ''tony robbins  so both of those pieces are inside you today, are they not?''tim ferriss  yeah, i would say so  i mean, certainly  how could they be, right?''tony robbins  so what happens is, if we understand where those sources are, we can reclaim certain aspects  that s a deeper, longer conversation, but it s like finding the pieces with your father, finding a different experience, a different set of memories even of your father that there may be deep in your unconscious that have been pushed away by the times that tightened you ''very often when we have an experience where we feel constricted in some way, like we re not able to please the person we love at the highest level, there is a tension that grabs in our body, almost like a muscle locking up  then what happens after that trauma or that frustration or whatever you want to call it, that intensity that happens in our nervous system is we don t let it go  oftentimes, it just stays with us  it could stay with us 20, 30 years later  we don t even know why we re feeling these feelings  we re trying to attack it from a million ways ''often you can reclaim and heal that by finding the memory before that, a much earlier memory, where perhaps your father was   maybe he never was   but where you felt an expression of love that was not tied to behaving in a certain way  where you could actually feel that, remember it  there s a liberation that occurs when we find that  so i m interested in knowing what drives people because it helps you understand who they are and where it came from  it helps you understand their strengths and their weaknesses so you can help them ''but i m also interested in helping people to heal those pieces that have come that where a person has adapted so much that they ve overused a part of themselves  like i had to be, in my case, it was my mother s loved that i craved  i had four fathers so i didn t really crave them  they weren t around enough, right? but my mother s love   and pleasing her was not an easy task   she would beat the shit out of you if you didn t do it   i love her to death  i m grateful i am the man i am because i learned so much of how to adapt and i don t want people to experience suffering like i experienced, so a huge part of who i am came from my mom  i m not dissing her in any way  but i had to go back and reclaim certain aspects of my life to have some real freedom in myself and knowing where i came from was very helpful  well, just as a side note also, i completely agree   and i think this is more just an observation that you can feel free to respond to but you don t have to   which is i do have those memories of sort of deep bonding with my dad at a very young age that weren t sort of predicated on any type of any of the things that we just discussed ''i ve tried very hard in the last few years also with a lot of the work that i ve done in the world of entheogens and psychedelics and so on as a way of facilitating some of this very early reintegration and self examination  i ve never been closer to my dad than now ''tony robbins  oh, that s beautiful  i just came back from a trip to paris with both of my parents and so there s been a lot of growth as a result of looking at, at trying to ask myself variants of some of these questions that you re posing ''tony robbins  you know, just so people are clear  i m not a big focuser on your past, but this specific element of who did you need to be and who did you not need to be? when you look at people that you really like a lot, you have tremendous passion or appreciation for, respect for, invariably it s because you see in them something that s actually in you ''but you ve dis identified with it because the source of love in your life that you were trying to please or prove to did not necessarily reinforce that form of yourself, so you dis identify  this is not me  i m the person i need to be for my mother or my father or whoever the case may be  so it s really useful from that standpoint so that you can begin to enrich and expand your life  it sounds like you ve used psychedelics as a way to go back there  it can be done, obviously, that way  it can also be done in very simple direct ways through closed eye, kind of hypnotic patterns that can be done over the course of an hour or two  i do those in many different events, including date with destiny  let s talk about investments for a second, but in a very broad sense  so if you had to think of the best or most worthwhile investment you ve made   and what i mean by that is an investment of money, time, energy   and i ll give you an example  just because it might clarify the question ''so amelia boone, who is the world s most successful female obstacle course racer, four time world champion, for her it was her first  450 00, which was a huge financial stretch at the time, for her first world s toughest mudder competition  she ended up winning and it took her on this completely different life trajectory, right?''tony robbins  yes  does anything come to mind for you?''tony robbins  probably the first one was going to a jim rohn seminar  i think i ve shared with you, i was working for this man helping him move  i was 17, i was in high school  i was just trying to earn extra money  my father had talked about this guy who had been such a loser before and how he d been so successful  so when you re 17, i told the guy  i said,  my dad said you used to be such a loser and now you re so successful  how come? what d you do?  he didn t like that response at first  but he told me he d gone to this seminar by this man named jim rohn  i d said,  what s a seminar?  he said,  this man gets up and shared with you the best of what he s learned over 20, 30 years of his life in an evening and saves you all those years  ''i said,  wow   i said,  is this happening soon?  he said,  yeah   he told me when  i said,  can you get me in?  he said,  yeah   and he just didn t say anything after that  i said,  well, will you?  he said,  no   i said,  why not?  he said,  because you won t value it if you don t invest in it   i said,  well, how much is it?  he said,   35 00 for three hours   i said,   35 00 for three hours? i made  40 a week as a janitor  i m going to high school  that s a week s pay!  he said,  well, then just go learn on your own experience and waste 10 or 20 or 30 years of life  ''so it s up to you  but he said,  i m not paying for and even though i could get you in, i m not going to  you decide   i wrestled for a week with that decision because it seemed like such a giant decision  but i look back on it as one of the most important decisions of my life because that night stimulated me  jim rohn became a model of what was possible to me of how i could help people long term  i had no direction or vision  i didn t even know such as a thing as a seminar or an event like that occurred  it all came out of that initial conversation ''so it was a damn good  35 00, even though it seemed like all the money i d ever see in the world ''and when i was interviewing these people, by the way, for the money master, the game, i interviewed 50 of the smartest financial people on the face of the earth, right? all these guys are self made, none of them are from the lucky sperm club  every single one of them, as you dug in with them, had different things  i asked them about their best investment and so forth  guys like warren buffett said his best investment was going to dale carnegie, he told me  he said,  you know, it s what you do  investing in yourself if the most important investment you ll ever made in your life ''there s no financial investment that ll every match it because if you develop more skill, more ability, more insight, more capacity,  he said,  that s what s going to really provide economic freedom for you because it s those skillsets that really make that happen   so i found that most people, there s different types of investments  where it s got to start with is your own development, which you ve done your whole life  i m working on it  i m still a collector of quotes  i capture them in evernote  what s surprising to me is how many of them are misattributed to people that actually originate with jim rohn  it s been amazing  i remember i was at a gym not long ago, a few weeks ago, and there was a t shirt that this gym had made which said,  don t wish it were easier, make yourself better   i think that actually goes back   a number of people pointed out   to jim rohn in some form ''tony robbins  yeah,  wish you were better    wish you were better,  exactly ''tony robbins  don t wish you were better  do you have any quotes that you live your life by or any particular maxims?''tony robbins  gosh, there s so many  but i think the core construct of my life is it s your decisions, not your conditions that shape your life  so it s in your moments of decision that your destiny is shaped  so you want to choose really well  you make a different decision, you have   i tell people, i think of the last 10, 20 years of your life  has there been a decision that if you made a different decision, your life would be completely different today? better or worse, i don t know, but completely different  everybody can relate to it  so i think most of us forget the power of decision ''you know, you don t like your job? change it  you don t like your relationship? change it  start by changing yourself because if you just change people, you ve got the same problems you re carrying with you, right? if you don t like your income, change it  and all of us have that capacity, but it really comes down to making decisions  most people don t make enough decisions  decision making is like a muscle  the more you make them, the stronger you get  if all you make are the easy decisions, any idiot can do that ''the most successful leaders are the ones that have to make decisions where they re likely maybe going to be wrong  but they figure out, you know, i ve got to make the decision quicker so if i m wrong i can find out quicker and make a better decision, change to the next thing and make it go  my life is about really how can i help people to change the structure of what creates decisions? what filters that is our beliefs, our values, our rules, and our emotions, obviously, because that shapes it all  i m constantly looking for the tipping point that can change the quality of this person s life  often we made decisions, 5, 10, 20 years ago that still affect us today ''sometimes those decisions were made as a child about life, about yourself, about what you believe about men or women or people or relationship or finance or anything  beliefs create and beliefs destroy  there s no such thing as a belief that doesn t have a consequence  the only question is it an uplifting consequence or a degrading consequence? so i m huge on finding what those are, eliminating the ones that are keeping people from making the decisions that move them forward and making that happen  i love quotes, but it s really more the hunt for excellence ''it s the hunt for what s outstanding  it s the hunt   just like you   it s one of the reasons i love you so much and respect you so much is i feel like we re different creatures, but we ve got some of the same core stuff in us, which is we want to understand the truth and we want to bring the truth to people  we want to find that truth and all its beautiful forms, different forms, so people have a variety of way of creating the quality of life they desire and they deserve  we re both kind of experimenters in that area  to me, that s what it s about more than the quotes themselves ''love quotes, love anything that s inspiring  i m touched by them all  but in the end, information has got to be converted  knowledge has got to be converted to action or it s worthless  jim rohn used to say, as my teacher, he d say,  if you let your learning lead to knowledge, you become a fool  if you let your learning lead to action, you become wealthy   his idea of wealthy was not just money, it was really rich mentally, emotionally, spiritually and financially, of course  i really have lived by that  looking at the flip side, what is some of the worst advice that you see or hear being dispensed often? in say, the self improvement world or self development world  it could be in any sphere, but i m just wondering if any particularly common, yet bad, advice comes to mind that you think is  ''tony robbins  oh, gosh  there s so much  that s such a  inaudible  to pick from  it depends on the start  i tell you  i d say financially, just because i finished four years of obsession on that subject  i m doing money master the game and getting that out to people  i m still so obsessed by it  as you know, we live in a culture that most people allow financial  professionals,  95 percent of which in the marketplace they call them wealth managers, there s 300 names, but 95 percent of the people you re talking about is a broker  it might be a really nice person, but the advice they re going to give you is based on what the house has taught them to sell, and the house always wins  these corporations are not bad, they re just trying to make profit for their shareholders  that s who they re focused on first  they re not focused on you ''so finding a fiduciary, as you know, is one of the most important elements  someone who is legally required to put your needs ahead of their own  so many people put their money in mutual funds  96 percent of all mutual funds don t even match the market over a 10 year period of time  only 4 percent will match it or beat it and that 4 percent is always changing  so you want to get someone who can give you advice who is extraordinary ''i am actually really excited that i wrote that book and then i donated all the money and i fed 100 million people and i m feeding another 100 million this year  i m going to feed a billion people over the next nine years, which i m really excited about   my partnership with feeding america  but in doing that, in writing the book, i wanted people to not be screwed over, so i spent  500,000 00, quite frankly, of my own money and then i donated that, just like the book, to create this online site where people could go and they could put their numbers in and they could find out what they actually were spending ''as i think you know, 1 percent in fees makes up ten years of income you lose  in other words, if you paid 2 percent when you could have paid 1 percent or 3 percent instead of 1, you d be paying 20 years  worth of future income out just in fees for the same stocks, the same bonds, the same investments you could ve owned for less  people just don t understand this  so i created the site and i had people go there and i donated the pieces  it instantly pulled all your accounts in and showed you what you re really being charged so that people could make better decisions  and then if you wanted a fiduciary, i recommended six of the best and largest firms out there ''then when i went to do my paperback, tim, something happened that just blew my mind  which was one of the guys on the site, his name is peter mellouk from creative planning  it s the no  1 rated wealth manager for the last three years, to give you an idea  no  1 for cnbc for the last two years  barron s was the first one for three years  no one s ever done it for three years  so he s brilliant, a brilliant guy  managing, at the time, about  17 billion  he said,  listen, tony  i want to sit down with you and have a conversation with you because you care so much about people, but there s a little gray area in the wall that some of the people you do business with are taking advantage of and i think you re going to go berserk when you find it out  ''you came to la for the ubw and i met him right afterwards, the same day at my hotel there  we sat down and talked and he showed me how these people that say they re a fiduciary, they re saying,  i m here legally required to take care of you,  now have this little component called  dual registration,  where they re a broker and they re a fiduciary  so you re going to somebody thinking that they re legally required   and they re going to tell you  i m legally required to take care of you  ''in the middle of the conversation they can switch hats and be a broker and sell you something that is an inferior product that gives them just a higher commission that has no value for you and they can do it  so i found out every person on the site but one was doing it  i couldn t believe it  it s just this gray area they re getting by with, so i ve knocked them off the site  i was talking to peter and i said,  peter, this is a great way to get rid of your competition   and he laughed  he goes,  no, it s the facts   i said,  no, i get it  ''i said,  you know what? if you re no  1 for three years in a row and no one s ever done that,  and he has this approach  you know, our billionaire friends all have family offices where you have seven or eight people who full time are looking at your mortgages and they re looking at your accounting and your investments  they look at every aspect of your life and they make it work  you ve got to be a billionaire to have it  he created a billionaire family office type format for millionaires  i said,  listen, if you d be willing to do this with people who have  100,000 00 or even  50,000 00, you won t make money on it  i know you won t make money on it, but i want to help everybody  if you ll do that, i d be interested in joining forces with you  ''we spent several months together  so now, so you know, i m pretty excited about it  i m partners with peter at creative planning  i m a member of the board of directors and i m also their head director of psychology for their investment group  now my focus is getting people to the right kind of person  so i m responsible for basically helping educate the public  and, of course, since i m a partner in the firm and if i grow the firm, if i get my clients, it helps my business and his business together, because we re together now  but i could ve been with anybody  i picked this guy because he s just second to none  so you ve got to find the right person ''the other side of decision making would be, i think, if you look at health  there s so many things in the health area that are so conflicted  i think you know, you asked me last time about diet and i told you i have a really boring diet  for 16 years, i was a vegetarian, a vegan  and then i began eating fish  that was the only thing i was eating  i felt stronger, i needed that ''about, gosh, three months ago, i had several challenges in a row  i had the challenge of first, for years of pounding my arms together with such intensity, 50 hours in a week out on stage, the nerves in my arms  i couldn t sleep on my side, so i slept on my back  not a big deal  but then my wife kept saying,  honey, you stopped breathing  i m really worried   i went to a sleep study and found that i stopped breathing 17 times in 16 minutes on my back  so extreme sleep apnea ''so they give you this sleep app, which is this like vacuum cleaner to put on your face  it s extremely sexy  you ll get girls with it for sure  i m just like,  are you kidding me? this is how i m supposed to live my life?  and then in the middle of this, i go snowboarding and i get in a snowboarding accident and i rip three of my rotator cuffs  i m good at handling pain  so it wasn t that big a deal  but then the pain starts going down my arm and i find this level of pain that s 9 9  i can handle pain, but it was as severe as anything i could imagine  i couldn t sleep, couldn t do anything ''went into the hospital for the mri and found out that i had spinal stenosis, where the nerves are being pinched and my spine is tightening up  they tell me i can t snowboard again, i can t play squash, i can t jump around on stage and be crazy  so i wasn t one to accept that  so long story short   i m telling you this because i have a core belief  the core belief is   you asked me about quotes   it s a belief  life is always happening for us, not to us  it s our job to find out where the benefit is  if we do, life is magnificent  so i m trying to find some benefit in not sleeping, not having pain, having a vacuum cleaner on my face and i won t give up ''all these guys are telling me my life is over, right? in the midst of all this, i m also experiencing something insane that i didn t tell my wife because i didn t want to worry her  i m only 56 years old and i ve never   i m on stage 50 hours, you know me, i don t forget a thing  my brain is just a strength  i m on stage and i m trying to figure out, all of a sudden, what did i just say? and why did i say it?''it was like dementia  so that s freaking me out  all this is happening at once  while i just   maybe six months before   made this decision that said i am going to become a master of joy and happiness like i never have before  as great as i think my life is, i m going to end suffering as it arrives  i m going to realize that there s only two places you can live   beautiful states of being  joy, happiness, love, passion, decisiveness, creativity, awe  all of those states that when you re in those emotional states, life is magnificent  you treat yourself and others at the highest level ''and then there are suffering states and none of us who are achievers would probably call it suffering  just like achievers are never fearful, they re just stressed  stress is the achiever word for fear  but if i follow your stress, it ll take me to your fear, same thing  so i never call it suffering  if you would ve said are you suffering? i would ve said suffering? are you kidding? i don t suffer? i have the most magnificent life  i have this incredible mission  i have millions of people that i meet and love  i ve got four incredible kids  i ve got the greatest wife in the world  i m physically fit ''i ve got financial freedom  but i did suffer because suffering really is any emotion that takes you out of those beautiful states  so i d get frustrated, i d get stressed, i d get concerned, i d get overwhelmed, i d get all kinds of feelings  they didn t last very long, but i d feel them  and i d say, well, that s part of life  but really what happened for me is   you talk about better advice  the advice i gave myself, the advice i got   i sent to india and spent some time with a friend of mine and came out of it and said the next level for me is realizing how to experience life at the highest level, every day, every moment ''finding ecstasy and joy in this moment with you, in a moment with my wife, in a moment when i m going to go talk with someone  billionaires are common  someone who is truly happy every moment of their life is not  so you talk about advice or direction  my whole obsession became to say look, my whole life is about helping people create an extraordinary quality of life  not a good one, not even a great one, just life on their terms ''whatever that is  for some people, that s three beautiful children  for some people, that s a garden  for some people, that s poetry  for some people, that s building a billion dollar business  there s no right or wrong  but whatever you really want, to get it you ve got to master two skills  the one everybody knows is the science of achievement  like we ve got to figure out how to take our visions and make them real  the people that do that are the people that everybody knows the name of and respect and who have their life they want it seemingly ''it is a science in that achievement, there are rules  if you want to know finance, there are rules to finance  i just spend four or five years doing it  if you follow those rules, you re going to have an abundance of money  you may not be a billionaire, but you re going to have an abundance of money  you break those roles   i don t care who you are   you re going to have financial stress  same thing with the body  you and i both know we re all biochemically unique, but there are certain fundamentals  if you violate them, you re going to have low energy and disease  if you align with them, you re going to have high energy ''so that s science of achievement  you and i could dig into that forever  but the one i m passionate about, the one i really want to jump on this call with you on, because i really want to spread the word, is two things ''it s this idea that the other skill you need   that is so boring and our culture does not reinforce it, does not show it s true importance   is the art of fulfillment  it s an art, tim  it s not a science  because what s going to light you up   you and i are good friends   and what lights me up, there s going to be a lot of things in common, there will be some things that are different  there s a woman in your life  she s going to love certain things and you re going to have in common certain things  she s going to be excited by things that don t excite you  that s just part of life  i was with steve wynn and i think you know steve is a dear friend of mine who built most of las vegas and macau ''he calls me up one day  this is the perfect example of this  he says to me,  where are you in the world?  i said,  i m in sun valley   we both have some escape homes in sun valley, vacation homes there  he goes,  i m in sun valley  do you know it s my birthday?  i said,  i do know it s your birthday, steve  i was going to call you   he said,  you don t need to call him  i m here  come see me   so i said,  i ll have to come see you   he said,  when you come, i ve got to tell you something  i have been coveting a painting for 17 years   he said,  i just outbid everybody at sotheby s for it,  and he said,  tony, you ve got to see it  it s incredible  i paid  82 million for this picture  ''i m like, oh my god  i ve seen some of his paintings  the picassos are amazing  he s got everything you can imagine  rembrandts  i said,  okay, i can t wait to see it   so i m driving to his house  i ll never forget it  i m picturing in my mind like the mona lisa, this is like a rembrandt, what is this? this is going to be incredible  i walk in his house and he goes,  look!  and i look up and it s a big red square  i mean, if you know art, it s called a rothko  rothko, yeah ''tony robbins  it s a big red square with a little bit of orange in it, right? and i look at him and i said,  steve, you know,  i first admired it and then i started teasing him  i said,  you know, give me  100 00 and 15 minutes and i could do this shit  i m telling you   he didn t like that  he goes,  you know, you don t understand  the guy committed suicide   well, if he committed suicide that should be his blood on there for  82 million, for christ s sake   so i teased him about it  the reason i bring it up is, he finds  82 million of value in that painting ''i respect him because i don t  he knows each brush stroke and what it means, what went into it and what the talent is  i don t have that level of sophistication around that kind of art  so i look at that and i go, red square  he looks at it and goes  82 million worth of value  that s how humans function  so you and i have to figure out what it is that really lights us up, because success without fulfillment to me is the ultimate failure in life  the worst advice you can get is go achieve all your goals  most people do that and they go, is this all there is? what you have to find out is what s going to fulfill you ''it s not like a science because it s different for everybody  you want to know what s   i m up here in b c  right now  i m looking out at the forest  you look at this forest   if you want to know what god loves, what the universe loves  it s pretty obvious  nothing is the same  it s all diverse  it s pure diversity, right? so that s what s real, but the principle that makes you feel fulfilled is you ve got to grow  anybody   i don t care how much money they have, how many academy awards they have, how many people they like or like them ''it doesn t matter what they have  it s never enough if you don t keep growing  because if you don t grow, you die  if your business is not growing, don t bullshit yourself  it s shrinking  if your relationship is not growing, it is shrinking, it is dying  there is no in between in real life with how things really live  and if you grow, the reason i believe growth is imperative in the universe   it s not my rules   everything in the universe grows or dies   is because it gives us something to give  i rely believe that s what we re made for  we re most alive when we don t just do something for ourselves  but we really feel like our life matters because it extends beyond ourselves into contribution ''so i ll give you a perfect example  i ve been sharing this example all over the world because it s just so relevant  i also wanted to test how people responded  so during these premieres of i m not your guru around the country, i m going up afterwards for q a and then i ask people, as well as in my seminars around the world, i d say,  we ve lost a national treasure in the united states two years ago   i ve asked this in china, beijing, in tokyo, in sydney, down in brazil, up in toronto, in america ''i said,  his name is robin williams   i said how many in this room   don t raise your hand if you liked robin williams  raise your hand if you loved robin williams   and 98 percent of the room in beijing, in tokyo, in sydney, i m talking about all over the world, 98 percent of the people, 99 percent raised their hand   and then i give shit to the 1 percent that are assholes that didn t like him  but i say,  you assholes   how could you not like robin williams, right? but the truth is, these people say they love him  they didn t even know him  now as he a master of achievement? science of achievement? you bet ''i mean, everybody comes to hollywood with big dreams  everybody tells you you re full of shit  this guy did it  he wanted his own tv show, he did it  he wanted the no  1 show, they all said there s no way  some people are ancient enough to remember mork and mindy and he did it  then he wanted to have the most beautiful family and he did it  then he said he wanted to make more money than he could spend and he achieved it  then he said,  this is not enough  i want to make movies, not just tv,  and he did that  then he said  i want to win the academy award for not being funny,  his no  1 skill, and he did it ''he said he wanted to make the whole world laugh and he did it  he wanted to get the whole world to love him and he did it  and he hung himself  hung himself in his own home  leaving hundreds of millions of people around the world literally that loved this man  and screw us, he left his children and his wife scarred for life  and he was a good man  how do you explain that? i ll tell you how to explain it  the worst advice a person ever got somewhere got stuck in his psychology that achievement was more important than fulfillment  it s the biggest fucking lie on the planet ''if you get it, if you wake up to it, you can actually have a life that is so rich and so beautiful, but the only way you can do it is you ve got to understand that this brain inside our heads is a 2,000,000 year old brain  this 2,000,000 year old brain was not designed to make you survive  it s ancient, old survival software that is running you a good deal of time  whenever you re suffering, that survival software is there ''the reason you re suffering is you re focused on yourself  you re obsessing on yourself  people tell me,  i m not suffering that way  i m worrying about my kids  my kids are not what they need to be   no, the reason they re upset is they feel they failed their kids  it s about them still  in fact, i began to uncover where all suffering comes from  i found the simplest little tools  i dug in  suffering comes from three thought patterns  loss, less, never ''if you are in a situation where you believe that someone did something   the government, your friend, your co worker, your kid, whoever, and because they did that you lost love or you lost an opportunity or you lost respect or you lost anything, the illusion of loss is the place we suffer  it is unconsciously, even when it s not conscious, because we re obsessing about ourselves  we re having this illusion that something happened and now life as we expect it to be is not there  our expectations are what are keeping us from feeling that happiness ''on the other hand, the other one is less  if you did something, i did something, you failed to do something as my friend, i failed to do something for you and as a result either of us starts thinking we have less respect, less love, less joy, less opportunity, less something, you re going to suffer  you re going to come up with those emotions that make you crazy  and the worst one is when you start thinking because you did this or i did this or you didn t do that or i did that or the government or somebody did something, because of that, we will never have something again, then people get crazy inside ''the antidote to that suffering is appreciation  it s getting outside of yourself and finding something to appreciate because we get so upset about stuff today that s nothing  i mean, i ll give you a perfect example  i m privileged enough now to have an intercontinental jet where i can go straight to china non stop  it s an unbelievable privilege at this stage of my life  but my whole life i ve flown commercial  i get on qantas airlines to go to australia, 14 hours, you know the drill  what i d be is like, i ve got 18 companies now, 12 of them that i actively manage ''we ve got 1,200 employees on three continents and 7 industries  we did  5 billion plus in sales this year, combined with all these people  with all that going on, i get on that plane and my brain would be like, oh my god  i m going to be disconnected for 14 hours  i d create all this stress  what s stressful about sitting? or lying down if you re privileged enough to be in a first class seat? the stories we tell ourselves that stress us out  but on this flight, it s like you re used to domestically you ve got access to internet and thank god you ve got connection to facebook and instagram ''god forbid that you d be apart from that for a few minutes and your emails  i get on the plane and they announce for the first time, we have internet  tim, i swear to god, it was like god entered the plane  people were cheering  people stood up, actually stood up and clapped  and i have to admit, i didn t stand up and clap, but i was doing that inside  like, oh, yeah, this is so cool! and then what do you think happens 15 minutes later?''tim ferriss  the internet is announced to not be working ''tony robbins  for how long?''tim ferriss  i have no idea ''tony robbins  14 hours  it never worked again  and people were like   this is bullshit! i m not putting up with this! what the hell is wrong with these people? my point is, 15 minutes earlier, it was a miracle ''now it s already an expectation  you want to change your life? you want to end suffering? stop just focusing on achievement  it s easy to achieve when you re fulfilled anyway  you feel better  actually trade your expectations for appreciation and your whole life changes in a moment  it s the whole game ''so what i decided to do is to realize if i was going to take a different level of life, life is too short to suffer  you know what it took me to suffer, tim? and i wouldn t call it suffering  i d say it was a little stressed or frustrated  i just added my phone nearby, that s all it took  what do you think the chances are if you re a listener right now, or you tim   what do you think the chances are with 1,200 employees across all these industries, multiple continents, what are the chances that someone is effing up something right now?''tim ferriss  i d say 100 percent ''tony robbins  what do you think the chances are? it s 100 percent  and if i had my phone nearby, there s going to be a text or an email or a slack or something to let me know that  i m going to go from this beautiful state i m in to what the? are you kidding me? and that would be my life  i realized that my happiness was so cheap  i would give my happiness over somebody not doing what i thought they should do  the more people that you re then responsible to and for the more likely the law of averages says it s not going to work out the way you expect  and so i finally decided   i got a no  1 and this is my invitation everyone  it s why i came on because i m so passionate about this  you can tell ''i hope   it probably feels like a soliloquy right now  i apologize, my friend, but i just want to plant the seed with everybody  because as beautiful a life and as blessed the life that i ve had, and i ve worked my ass off for it and i ve been blessed, both, but out of all of that nothing compares to the last year and a half when my wife and i both made this distinction and said there s only two states you live in  beautiful states or suffering states and life is too short to suffer ''when we start to suffer we have a 90 second rule  feel it for 90 seconds, figure it out, and let it go  because all these things we re so upset at   my preference is that everyone would do things a certain way  my preference is i d have the internet on the plane  we all have these preferences that we make life and death  it s like this survival mechanism in our brain is always looking for what s wrong  that s what it does  that s the survival mechanism  it s looking for what s wrong so you can fight it or flight it ''but there s no longer a saber tooth tiger to avoid, so now it worries about what are people thinking of me? or do i have enough money in a country where if you live in poverty in the united states, you re actually in the 1 percent of the world  people say they re in the 99 percent are lying  half the world lives on  2 50 a day   900 00 a year  so i don t want anybody being in poverty anywhere  but we live in a world where most of us are looking for what s wrong  what s wrong is always available  so is what s right  if you don t control of your focus, everything in your life will disappear ''we have this 90 second rule  if you want later on in the show here, i can do a little process with everybody for two minutes and show them how to end some suffering as it occurs  yeah, i d love that ''tony robbins  now, suffering will show up again because the mind is always looking for what s wrong  so it shows up  it s not like it won t show up, it s just you kill it  i always tell people,  kill the monster while it s a baby  don t wait until it s godzilla eating the city   whatever little challenge you ve got, you want to kill it right away, so in the beginning it should ve probably been a four hour rule, quite honestly  and years ago it would ve been a four month rule of upset and so forth, but we ve really gotten it down like a muscle to 90 seconds ''i cannot tell you the level of magnificence and joy and happiness you have when you don t stress out about all the stuff that you can t control that s just a preference and you find the beauty in everything and you use what life is offering you  i mean, i ve always done this, it s like anything else  you can t manage something you don t measure  i wasn t measuring this because i just called these other emotions  they weren t dominant, they weren t destroying my life  they were just showing up at times  i called that life ''no, that s not life  that s survival software  that s an old brain  and i teach my brain what to do  i don t let my brain   i don t have an argument  i don t have negotiations in my mind  i ve trained my brain through conditioning to do this  and now this year, i ve trained it to just let go and find what is beautiful in each moment  and i m telling you, there is nothing on earth that i ve experienced that has brought my joy to me, to my wife  because also when you re doing that, you re in a different place  you can t be present with someone when you re stressed out inside ''if there s really a problem, it s so much easier to solve when you re in a beautiful state of being with all your ability and strength, than when you re in a stressed out state  and all the people that think getting stressed out makes me better  it s bullshit  i can tell you  you might look like you re getting better, but you haven t really tried being in the ultimate beautiful states and solving something and seeing how much faster it ll be  so i am on a journey to invite people to make the most important decision of their life, which is deciding to end suffering, deciding to live in a beautiful state ''that s my spiritual vision now  my friend who s name is kristin ji in india said,  what s your spiritual vision?  that s how this conversation started  he said to live in a beautiful state all day long, every day  that s my entire piece  because if i do that, everything else comes from it  someone asked me the other day,  what would cause someone to kill men, women and children?  like you ve seen happen in paris and what happened in nice recently and what s happened obviously in orlando and san bernardino  i said,  i can t tell you the kind of person who did it, but i can tell you who didn t do it  a happy person didn t go kill all those people  ''a fulfilled human being, a person in a beautiful state does not plot or try to harm anybody, much less kill anybody  a person in a beautiful state is not out there trying to steal from somebody else  so you know when you get on airplane and the first thing they say is if we have a problem and we lose oxygen the mask will drop down and put it on your child first, right? no  they say put it on yourself first, which seems selfish with your child  we all want to take care of our kid first  but the reason is if you don t take care of yourself, you re going to have nothing for that child and that child s going to die too ''putting yourself in a beautiful state is putting that living oxygen inside of you and then you have things to give other people  as long as you re suffering, suffering begets more suffering  so i always tell people,  figure out what your favorite flavor of suffering is  are you a person that gets stressed out all the time? is it anxiety? is it worry? is it anger? is it pissed off? it is trying to please everybody? what is your favorite style of suffering and end it  because when you end that, there s a level of freedom that no amount of money will give you  no amount of love will give it to you  no amount of accolades  no amount of academy awards, none of that ''i get the call from all those multi billionaire clients and from all those people in the entertainment business who ve got everything and they re miserable  they bring me in to help me with their business or whatever it is, and i m the trojan horse  i give them what they want, but then i know what i m really there for is to also give them what they need and to help them to find that joy and happiness  so i ve been doing that ''like managing coaching paul tudor jones, one of the top 10 financial traders in the history of the world and a guy who in 1987 when the stock market took its biggest percentage drop ever, percentage wise, still the most, and he made 200 percent for his clients, and then he lost money  but i ve been coaching him now for 22 years  he hasn t lost money in 22 years  so i m doing my job  but i m also making sure that man is fulfilled  and that to me is my real mission with him, even though i m helping him on the business side in a way that he s very pleased with  making sure that his life is fulfilled is my ultimate drive ''so i m finished with this little piece  i just think a lot of people say to me well, you know, god s not really in my life  i don t know there s a god or an infinite energy or whatever you want to call what you think has created you  i always say to people, can you imagine if you were the creator and you come here to one of your creations and you say to this person, joe, how do you like what i created for you? and he says, geez, god it s hot as shit here  couldn t you have just kept it as 78 degrees? why did you have to change all these temperatures and make it so tough? and man, you ve got these stupid people i ve got to deal with all the time  they re always getting in my way and, you know, why do i have to work for a living?''plus you ve got these little red ants  they re tiny little ants and they bite my ass and they hurt like hell  why would you create these annoying ants? now, if you re a god, do you want to hang out with this person? and if you re a human, do you want to hang out with him? and then if you re god, you go to someone else and you say how s it going? the creation i created for you? and the guy says, hey, man, god, this is so incredible  this is the most beautiful place i could ever imagine  the sky, the air, the water  oh my god there s so many different people that challenge me and help me to grow and learn and people i can love ''and oh my god you even created these red ants  i mean, these red ants are so tiny  i m 1,000 times their size and they re so courageous  they come even bite me  it s cool what you ve created here  who do you want to hang with? so if he goes i don t have god in my life, it s probably because you whine and bitch too much to feel god s presence, right? we have got to stop the suffering  i don t know many people that don t suffer regularly  they don t call it suffering, but that s what they do  and it s something you can end  not like one time  it s like drawing the line in the sand and saying if i want to take the island, i m going to burn the boats  i m not going back ''and then committing yourself to it and not beating yourself up  i don t say to my wife, oh, you re suffering and you need to change and we have a 90 second rule  it doesn t work that way  i m just like,  honey, i don t know if you re suffering or not  i feel energy in you right now and i want you to know i m here for you and anything i can do to help   we do our own internal work, but if she suffered for whatever period of time internally, i m there for her but i m not going to make her wrong for it  because what happens is your brain starts to see how life can really be and it is more beautiful than most humans will ever dream of  so most people try to drink or smoke or do something to alter their state to get in a beautiful state  i m telling you, you can wire yourself to be that way ''so this is my little soliloquy  thank you for letting me pump it out  because you re such a gem, tim, to let me do it  but it s just like if i could get every human being to truly make the decision, keep the word and keep practicing, because it s a daily practice  because i still feel it  if something shows up, you see it and you let it go  but as you do it more and more, like i said, it s like a muscle ''there is a level of joy as much as you d ever dreamed you d have, i m telling you there s 100 fold out there and i m inviting your listeners to consider trying a real simple ten day challenge to say, for ten days i m not going to suffer  i m going to end it, i m going to let it go  i m going to realize don t sweat the small stuff  it s all small stuff  i m going to stop obsessing about myself and i m going to focus on what i can appreciate and what s beautiful and just try it and see what happens ''at the end of ten days if you rely believe it s the most important thing in life like i do, then you commit to that decision long term and maybe surround some of your friends and family, sharing why you ve done it so you ve got some leverage on yourself and you keep moving forward and keep expanding  and for people who   i m going to take you up on what you said a little bit earlier, just in terms of describing how the 90 second rule works in practice  i think a lot of people listening want to take you up on the challenge and to have the 90 second rule process in their toolkit as part of that  what does it look like? could you give us an example of what that might look like?''tony robbins  i ll give you an example where i had to use it recently  i was in dallas, i don t know, three or four weeks ago and i was doing an unleashed power with an event and we had about 7,500 people there, 8,000 people there  we went to do the fire walk  it was no different than any other fire walk i ve ever done in 35 years  we also have a quarter of one percent or a half of one percent, under one percent of people that have hot spots or blisters  they know they could get it in advance  it s like going   if you re going to go do a marathon, you know you could get blisters and if you do, you don t quit, you push through it and it s a badge of courage and you re proud of yourself, right?''and you know the fire walk, that s what it is  it s an experience of someone overcoming their fear  it s something real  it s visceral and you ve got to get yourself to take action in spite of it  there is some exposure or some danger, if you want to call it that  everybody knows it  we have medical professionals on site and they take care of people  it s aloe vera and some blisters, they go away, right? i m not making like it s no big deal, but it s not a big deal  and this happened to me five years ago in san jose, where somebody was driving by and saw some people coming out, called 911 and said there s all these people burning here ''it became this story overnight that all these people had burned at this fire walk  it went around the world in the news cycle   the 24 7 news cycle where people don t have   they don t reporters out to interview, they just copy the same story and do the same thing over and over again  they said people were hospitalized  not a single person was hospitalized  none of it was true  fox news   it took four weeks, but arianna huffington has been to our events, so she put a reporter on this who actually went out and investigated, went to the hospital and found out no one was hospitalized, found out it was all bullshit  so they wrote a story and my lawyers actually worked and got fox news, believe it or not, to do a reversal and they apologized and said it was incorrect ''then a few weeks ago, i m dallas and the same exact thing  somebody who doesn t know what s going on calls 911 and says you ve got to send ambulances, there s hundreds of people burning  nobody was hospitalized  five people wanted additional attention  they looked at it, saw they were fine and released them  they re all in the seminar the next day  but everyone, my email box, my texting, everything s filled with people all over the world saying i m so sorry about what happened to you and what happened at the event, and nothing happened at the event ''so you can only imagine  not this was not truly 90 seconds, so that s why i m telling you this one  this one was like 30, 40 minutes, because every time i thought it was done, another thing came in  but here s what i did eventually, i got myself back to this process  there is a set of scientific studies that show that when your mind and your heart   your heart actually has hormones that affect the way your brain functions  it s not just your brain affecting your heart  they interact  when they re in alignment, human beings are able to resolve internal conflicts ''often the conflicts we have are between our conscious and unconscious mind  between our mind and our heart per often as an example  if i were to put electrodes on your brain and your heart, as you well know an eeg and ekg, we could see that they re both in your normal state pretty jagged up and down and they don t look anything like each other  but if all you do is put your hands on your heart physically and anyone listening, let s go ahead and do this right now in a second  but i ll first tell you what we re going to do ''you put both your hands on your heart physically and you feel your heart  you put all your focus in your heart  you breathe into your heart  you feel gratitude for two minutes, where you think of three events in your life you feel grateful for and you step in and feel it  at the end of two minutes, you are in what i call a beautiful state because i can look at your eeg and ekg and it s dramatic  first, they aren t jagged, they re rounded, but what s mind boggling and i m sure you probably know this tim, they literally sync up  they become identical  they look like they re tracing each other ''when that happens, it s not just your mind  i always tell people,  you get in your heard, you re dead   your mind is great for strategy, but it ll never make you enjoy your life  it ll never let you enjoy the taste of an apple because it ll go, is it organic? where did it come from? versus your heart, which can bring the juice of anything back to you  so what really i m trying to do with everyone in this situation is i m trying to show them how to line these up  it s really easy ''if you want to do it right now and you want to test that it works, let s do this  tim, you can do this with me if you d like to  sure ''tony robbins  think of a situation   you might not have any in your life, tim, you re so crazy in this area and so on top of it, but most of us have situations where there are, for all of you listening, a place where you have some unfinished business  that s the story of my life, tony ''tony robbins  okay, well probably a story of all our lives, right  that s just being human, right? but it s a place where there s something that you should ve handled and you haven t handled with a person or situation  it stresses you out and so what we tend to do is focus on other stuff because we don t want to have to deal with that because it s stressful  it s painful  and so think of something that on a 0 to 10 scale, where 10 is totally stressed out and 0 is not at all   pick something that s unfinished business in your business or personal life, something or someone, and it s at least a 7, 8, 9 or a 10  just so you can see that this really works  now by the way, there are hundreds of ways to do this  i m just going to give you this one because we can do it in two minutes, all right? so i m hoping   tim, do you have one by chance?''tim ferriss  i do ''tony robbins  you don t have to tell me the content  okay, perfect  and no one else has to tell us the content  all right  everyone if you would, just for a moment, and i don t have any music in the background, which i do to enhance this normally, but let s just do it  put both your hands on your heart and physically breathe deep into your heart  as you re breathing deep in your heart, feel the strength of your heart  feel the power of your heart  feel the beauty of your heart  what are you proud or grateful that your heart has guided you to do or to give or to feel or to enjoy?''feel the strength of your heart  breathe into it  feel the blood flow, the oxygen  feel grateful for your heart first  because think about it, you didn t have to earn this heart, it was given to you  you didn t have to prove your value or your worth ''you didn t have to accomplish anything  something loved you enough to give you the gift of life  as long as this heart is beating, you have that gift and you live  it beats 100,000 times a day  it pumps blood through 60,000 miles of blood vessels  they put them end to end, they go around the earth twice at the equator  that s what s inside every one of us and you don t have to think about it  what a gift ''so as you breathe in your heart, feeling your powerful heart, i want you just for a moment   we re going to think of three   but just think first of one event in your life, one experience, one moment that you could feel so grateful for if you wanted to, a magic moment, a sacred moment, a sexy moment, a beautiful moment, a loving moment, any moment that really you could feel grateful for if you wanted to right now  then step into that memory for a minute  like step in your body as if you were there  see what you would ve saw then as if you re there or hear what you d hear back then ''breathe the way you were breathing back then  and if you fill up with that sense of gratitude for that moment, how do you smile when you feel so grateful or so thankful? what s the look in your eyes? how do you breathe? what s the look on your face when you feel really, really grateful? and just fill it up, fill up with gratitude  the reason we use gratitude, by the way, is the two emotions that mess us up most are anger and fear  you can t be grateful and angry simultaneously  it s the antidote  you can t be fearful and angry simultaneously ''so fill up with the gratitude and now think of a second moment you could fill truly grateful for and again, breathe deep in your heart, feeling that power  just think of any other moment  it could be from your childhood or adulthood  it could be last week, it could be today, it could be ten years ago  any moment that you could just truly feel like that was grace, that was magical, that was beautiful, or that was magnificent ''something that gives you the feeling of tremendous gratitude if you really focused on it  breathe it, feel it, enjoy it  fill up with gratitude  then finally think of a third moment you could feel truly grateful for  step in it  see it, feel it, be there  feel the gratitude  what were you so grateful for? what are you grateful for? and then maybe throw one extra one in  think of a coincidence  we all love when life happens for us and not to us  we love coincidences because we didn t do anything  something happened for us ''you were going to do one thing and you met somebody that you developed a partnership with or became a friend or a lover or the love of your life or maybe a business opportunity came from a coincidence  or an insight came from a coincidence that s been so valuable in your life  something you re grateful for  what s a coincidence that led to something you re so grateful for?''feel the gratitude for that  was it a coincidence or were you guided? hmm  now as you breathe in your heart  you ve been doing this for about two minutes  keep breathing, keep feeling it, feeling grateful  let s use this state to solve the problem state  so the easy way to do that is to keep breathing your heart  stay out of your head  in your heart  think of that situation that s unfinished business that s stressed you out in the past, but keep breathing in this beautiful state and ask yourself this question  all i need to focus on in that situation, all i need to focus on, all i need to remember is what? your heart knows ''all i need to focus on, all i need to remember, all i need to do in that situation is what? your heart knows the answer  all i need to focus on, all i need to remember, all i need to do is?''your heart probably knows the answer  i ve done this a million times  not every one of you, but in a normal room, i d say raise your hand if you ve got that answer and 98 percent, 99 percent of the people usually do, even with this simple technique  you know what to do, what s next  what happened for you, tim?''tim ferriss  yeah, no  i did get a lot of clarity  quite frankly, even if i didn t get the clarity in the problem, just the state shift   and this is something, of course i ve been to unleash the power within, just the   we don t have time to necessarily dig into right now, but just the state story strategy, as opposed to the other way around, it s just so   and it s very easy for me to forget, just because i m so hyper rational and i like to depend on the brain, on the mind for strategy, but if as i remember, and i m just paraphrasing here, you put it if you re in a negative state or a frazzled state, you only see the problem  you only see the problems, you don t see sort of the space in between ''tony robbins  that s correct  so, yeah, that s a tremendous exercise  that s great ''tony robbins  you know what it is? it s taking the power of your incredible cognitive capacity but bringing in the infinite capacity of the heart, which changes, it changes the state, as you said  in a different state, you get totally different answers  beautiful states of being, we want to cultivate them  so two minutes, put your hands on your heart  breathe  think of three things you re really grateful for  fully associate and then think of what was bothering you and what you need to resolve and just go, all i need to focus on, all i need to remember, all i need to do is what? and you ll get your answer  that s just one technique, but it works so easily and it works for most things  since it reminds me so much of my in person experience with you at the event   of course, we ve met outside of the event   but i wanted to ask you a question that s going to segue into a conversation about the doc   because i actually watched   i was very honored to get to the doc before it came out publicly ''man, talk about   and i feel like good films, whether they re fiction or documentaries tend to do this, but there are a lot of moments when you don t know whether to laugh or cry  it s a very emotionally powerful film  how has date with destiny evolved over the last say decade or so?''tony robbins  oh, that s interesting  and for those people who don t know, what is date with destiny?''tony robbins  that s good  well, you mentioned earlier unleash the power within, which is my four day, weekend seminar that we do for 8,000 to 10,000 people  i love if you make any comments because i hope that some of your listeners will come join us  i know you ve had a great time and we can share that  but date with destiny, i see about 200,000 people a year in 12 to 15 countries  some of the countries i go two or three times, like australia, london and so forth  but i only see 2,500 people on date with destiny ''i only do one event in the united states once a year there and do it in december, usually in florida  it is six days long  i do one in australia also, but in the us only one time  six days long, 2,500 people ''people do 10, 20 pages of homework  i read it all  it s an experience designed to help you to uncover what controls every thought, feeling and emotion of your life  every thought, feeling and emotion  what you do, what you don t do is controlled by your beliefs, your values and your rules  most of us did not consciously pick most of those  we adapted them to our environments and to the people we were trying to please  so our life is a reflection of us and a lot of conditioning  this allows you to open it up and say i am now the conditioner  what is it that i truly want most from my life at this stage of where i am today? not ten years ago ''what s in the way? how do i remove it and what do i need to replace it with deep in my nervous system? not just in some thought pattern, but literally in the way my nervous system functions  we do this six days and nights  it goes 12, 13 hours a day  joe berlinger, who is an amazing two time academy award nominated and two time emmy winning, two time peabody winning documentarian, he s done some amazing films ''i saw metallica  some kind of monster, which is a brilliant film about these guys going through a new stage of life and hating each other and how they re going to break through and intervene  he also did one called paradise lost, which was three films done over two decades, where he got three men who were innocent off of death row  that s the kind of guy he is  but he s seen the worst side of life  i met him  we have a mutual friend who created the show billions  which as an aside, if people have seen that show, the woman in that show is the coach to the billionaire hedge fund guys  i trained her  a lot of those things are actually things i really do  her sex scenes i did not train her in, but the other stuff  '' crosstalk  you don t do the domination and the stilettos?''tony robbins  no, the domination   those weren t my stilettos, but the rest of it s there  yeah, brian koppelman, right?''tony robbins  yeah, you know brian  that s right  yeah ''tony robbins  so brian koppelman introduces us and this is 2012  i just sense here s this beautiful man that i had so much respect for and he wasn t fulfilled  perfect example  he s like got all these academy awards  i mean, if you ve gotten three people who are dying off of death row, what else can you do in your life to have value to feel like your life is worthwhile?''but i could feel he was turning 50, he wasn t there  so long story short, i invited him on date with destiny  he s told me since that he couldn t understand why he went  he said,  i m not a seminar guy  i m not into any of this stuff  i m skeptical  i m pessimistic  i see the worst side of life   but something inside of our conversation intrigued him  i got him there and within two hours, he wanted to run  he was trying to get out of the building  he just said,  i can t take this energy and this jumping and this music and people want to talk to me and they want to ask me personal questions   he goes,  i m just not made for this  ''he called his wife and said,  tony s such a nice guy and he invited me here, what s my exit strategy? i can t do six hours more  i can t do six minutes more of this shit   she said to him,  honey, there s a reason you were pulled to do this  you never would in a million years  you won t even take a six day vacation  why don t you stay at least one more day before you bail?  the next day, we did this process where i had everyone reclaim   i asked people what their earliest memory is ''then i have them reclaim the memory before that that you don t realize is there  when you do, it releases what was holding you back  he woke up, opened his eyes, flooded with tears  he said he hadn t cried in 20 years like that and felt this incredible relief  he said, okay, i m in, i m going to play full out  and then at the end of it, he saw how cinematic this was  these interventions are pretty dramatic  suicidal ones, people that are so successful and miserable  all these things  and so he came to pitch me on it, thinking i was going to say yes and i said no for two years because i just didn t want to disrupt the environment ''i didn t want to disrupt the people there  because i have cameras, but they re long distance lenses, only so you can see the person s face on a giant screen with 2,500 people, so you get to be fully associated  but somebody doing a documentary with a camera in your face is a different game  so after two years, he said,  look, what if i came in and if you think it interferes with their experience, you end it, it s my loss   i said,  if you re willing to take that risk, then i m willing to do it because i just can t let it disrupt the people   and i was also skeptical  how are you going to take six 13, 12, 14 hour days and put it in less than two hours?''but that s why he s got the academy awards and he did a phenomenal job  we had 500,000 people join us just on facebook live on the day it came out after they watched the film for q a  it was just like the response to it has been greater than anything we could have ever imagined  i ve had a number of friends reach out to me to recommend that i see the doc, which of course i appreciate  i will say also for those people listening who don t have a lot of exposure to tony or maybe have misconceptions  the most common thing i ve heard from friends who ve seen the doc is, i thought tony was x and now i think about tony totally differently  i think it s very hard to appreciate some of your unique abilities and tools without seeing some of the interventions, for instance  it s a very different, visceral and powerful experience  so i certainly recommend it ''i ve already recommended it and watched it very early on and just love this  where can people find the doc, i am not your guru? where s the best place for people to check it out?''tony robbins  it s on netflix now  it s in 190 countries already translated  so we re pretty thrilled about the exposure that we ve had around the world  but i just want you to know, i didn t make the film so people would understand me more  i want me to have a transformational experience  what joe did so brilliantly is it s like a concert film  he drops you   he s the fly on the wall and you actually get to enter that event and experience what it s really like  just like a great movie, when you watch the characters, you feel what they feel  well, you feel these characters as they re transforming and it has a transformative effect ''i was just in new york the other day and there was a woman who stood up after the premiere and she was crying and she just said,  i just have to tell you, i ve been laughing and crying this entire two hours  she said,  i have stage 3 cancer and i just had given up  i was coming here and i thought, who the hell is tony robbins? what the hell is this bullshit?  but a dear friend dragged her there and she said,  i m going to heal   she goes,  i m in one million percent  i can t even tell you the transformation  ''i just got back from traverse city, michigan  michael moore calls me up and he saw the film  he used to think what i did was b s  he didn t know me personally, he just thought personal development and anything of that nature is just all a lie, it s all b s  he called up and said,  this film effed me up  this changed me  this made me a better person  it made me a better filmmaker   he s put this in writing   a better filmmaker, a better person   he said,  i think this film will save lives,  and so he asked us if we d fly out to traverse city for his film festival, which we just did the other day ''i mean, i probably laughed harder than i ever have in my life hearing his tell the story of what this film did to him  so we re really pleased  it s free  go on netflix, it s free  if you re in 190 countries anywhere in the world, and i know my followers are all over the world and so are yours  you can go on netflix and if you don t have netflix, you can join for, i think free for the first month or  8 00  but you get everything for it  so we re excited to have this available for everyone  just as a side note, because you mentioned the crying  i m not much of a crier and never have been, but man  i won t spoil it by giving too much context, but the intervention with the brazilian woman   that completely knocked me on my ass  there s so really, really powerful moments and transformational moments in the doc  so i recommend everybody check it out  tony, i want to let you get back to your day  is there anything else that you would like to share with people? any parting thoughts or anything else that you might want to add? oh, actually, there are two maybe quick things we could touch on  you mentioned your breakfast but never came back to it ''tony robbins  oh, yeah, thank you for that  you were reading my mind  i want to close that loop  and then also with your financial partner, if there is a particular website or service available that people should check out or that is going to be launching, if you want to mention that ''tony robbins  sure  if you would like to have a second opinion, like someone to look at your finances for you, they ll do it for free at creativeplanning net ''as i said, they do like a home office for someone who s not a multi billionaire  they literally look at every aspect of it  as full disclosure, so you understand, i m a member of that team, so if you join, i benefit in some way from an sec perspective, but those are   i just want you to be clear about that  but i could ve teamed up with anybody  as i say, he s been rated no  1 three years in a row by barron s  no one s done that in history  no  1 wealth manager  so he s a phenomenal guy  as far as the other piece, the reason i was telling the story was two fold  i don t give up, right? so i left off with now i ve got spinal stenosis and they tell me i can t do anything  i m going to doctor after doctor ''i find a guy in australia who says with 100 hours of hyperbaric oxygen at two levels deep, 65 feet below, you will see changes in the spine that people say are impossible  because the new science shows that you get 800 percent more stem cells released in the body when you do this  it goes to the parts of the body that need to be healed or that are inflamed and starts to heal them  he sent me some mris for me to look at   before and after s ''it looked like magic  so i said okay, i m doing this  i ll fly to australia, i ll see this guy  i ve got to work on this  i ve got so much going on with my nervous system  he says to me,  tony, before you come, i want you to do these inflammation tests so i can see if you have any sidokines and he s kind of describing there  so i go get a blood test and while i m there a man says to me,  do you want to do a metals test while you re here?  i said,  well, what metals?  like mercury, lead  i said,  well, i had my amalgams out 25 years ago, so i don t think it s a problem but why not? let s do it  ''that metals test came back  the doctor called and he said,  i must speak to you, it s an emergency   he wouldn t leave a message  so i finally call him  he said,  mr  robbins, we measure mercury on a 0 to 5 scale  if you re 3, 4, 5 you re in danger, you ve got to get it out of your nervous system   the said,  the most i ve ever measured in a human is 75  you re 123   wow ''tony robbins  i was dumbfounded  he said,  are you losing your memory at times?  i was like, i hadn t even told my wife this yet, right? because i thought i ve got to figure this out ''i said,  yes, it s been happening on stage   he said,  look it up  a lot of people are misdiagnosed with dementia when really it s mercury poisoning  it s just your short term memory  it ll come back once you get it out, as long as there s not long term damage   i said,  i can t tell you, you made me breathe a level i can t even tell you   he said,  in addition, how exhausted are you?  i said,  i don t think i ve ever felt more exhausted in my life  i couldn t figure it out  i know i m working my tail off, but i ve always worked my tail off   he said,  tony, it literally disrupts inside the,  what do you call it? inside the cells  mitochondria?''tony robbins  yeah, the mitochondria  so that s the factory of energy in the body, right? so you literally are having your energy depleted out of your nervous system  he said,  you can have a cardiac arrest from this experience, especially at this level, even if your arteries are clean   he said,  we have to get this out   so i ve been on this massive detox  the reason i m sharing it is all this shit i went through not being able to breathe and sleep, torn rotator cuffs, spinal stenosis, it all seemed like the worst things that could happen in your life ''i was practicing beautiful state and because i was practicing that, had been practicing beforehand   this would have devastated me  everything in my life seems to be done and i m doing seven hours a day, six to seven hours a day of oxygen therapy, of detoxification, of meyers into my veins, all the stuff that you ve got to do to do this and still running my companies and being on stage and doing all the crazy things i m doing, but because i was practicing it, i was able to separate the 9 9 pain from suffering  so i want people to get this  you can have pain without suffering ''the pain was off the charts  hard to sleep, hard to move, hard to do anything initially  but what was beautiful was, i started realizing the suffering was the story i had  the story of why this happened to me  will i ever get this out of me? will i ever be able to play squash again? get on stage again? snowboard again? all that stuff that the mind wants to do because it s so fearful and it s trying to fight or flight, and i was just end it, end it, end it, end it and go, it s just pain ''it s just pain and i m going to find the solution to this  i kept putting myself back in that  if i had not been practicing this before, it never happened  also, if i had not had all these pain and problems, i wouldn t have found out i have all these metals in my body and i d be dead within a year or two  so the good news is i m down to 32 from 123 and i think in the next 90 days i ll have the rest of that out of me  i m doing the oxygen therapy and i m going to do stem cell therapy and i m going to get myself back where it belongs  but i ve been telling the story and sharing with everybody i know, all my friends to start with ''i ve had three different friends with incredibly high mercury lead  one guy had rat poisoning in him  he used to work in the dental field and you probably know, dentists have the highest suicide rate in the world and part of that has to do with all the metals  we live in an environment that is toxic  you say where d you get all that metal in your body? i told you before, all i eat was fish and the two fish i used to eat always were swordfish and tuna were my favorite  i d have salad, swordfish and tuna, like clockwork  they live 75 years  they consume all the smaller fish ''they have 1,000 times more mercury in them and no one s going to talk about this because the fishing industry would be killed by it  so i moved to land based proteins for the most part with clean sources, something radically different than i ve ever been in my life  i mean, i haven t had anything of that nature since i was 17  but i want to be healthy and be alive  the world has changed so you have to adapt with it  so i really recommend anyone listening, get a metals test  it takes nothing  it s a little bit of blood and know where you are because so many people are misdiagnosed with a variety of elements ''it s these metals that are now so much a part of our environment and getting into our blood and pushed into ourselves, but you can get it out  there s a man named dr  shade, by the way, you can look him out on the web  i think he s one of the most advanced in this area  he has a ph d  in metal detoxification  he had a mercury problem himself  he s come up with some ways that are less intense than traditional chelation  shade spelled like s h a d e?''tony robbins  yes, dr  shade  s h a d e  and he s an expert in this area  got it  i ll check it out  well, tony, i want to let you get back to beating the various drums and the many missions that you have set before you ''tony robbins  thanks, tim  it s always fun to talk and i really appreciate the time, as i m sure everybody listening does  i certainly wish you a speedy recovery with the mercury ''tony robbins  thank you  i do encourage everybody to check out i am not your guru  it s time very well spent  any final words, tony, before we jump off?''tony robbins  no, just love you, brother  i feel like we re aligned, we re on the same path here  i m such a big fan of your work and i m so thrilled so many people get to hear you  i hope you continue to take care of yourself and you re here a very, very long time, brother  thank you  i really appreciate it  this was the conversation i needed  i was having a tough day and after the heart, after the 90 second exercise, i feel infinitely better already  so i m ready to get back to it  i really appreciate it, tony  for everybody listening, as always, you can find show notes, links to many of the things, if not all of the things, we discussed in the show notes at fourhourworkweek com podcast  until next time, thank you for listening '"
178,186,Tony Robbins on How to Resolve Internal Conflict (#186),"'many, many, many of you asked for a stand alone podcast episode just for this particular exercise that he walk you through in real time  so, tony robbins, of course  you can say hello to him  on all of the socials and you should definitely check out i am not your guru, which is a documentary about tony robbins now available on netflix and much, much more  say hi to him, but i am going to keep this short  please enjoy  hopefully you will listen to this exercise many times, which so many people have found extremely helpful ''tony robbins  there are scientific studies that show that when your mind and your heart   your heart actually has hormones that affect the way your brain functions  it is not just your brain affecting your heart  they interact  when they are in alignment, human beings are able to resolve internal conflicts  often the conflicts that we have are between our conscious and our unconscious mind  between our mind and our heart often, as an example ''if i were to put electrodes on your brain and on your heart   as you all know, an eeg and an ekg   we could see that they are both, in your normal state, pretty jagged up and down and they do not look anything like each other  but, if all you do is put your hands on your heart physically   and anyone listening, let us go ahead and do this right now in a second  but, i ll first tell you what we are going to do  you put your both of your hands on your heart physically and feel your heart, you put all your focus in you heat, you breathe into your heart  you feel gratitude for two minutes where you think of three events in your life you feel grateful for and you step in and feel it ''at the end of two minutes, you are in what i call a beautiful state because i can look at your eeg and ekg and it is dramatic  first, they are not jagged, they are rounded  but, what is mind boggling and i am sure that you probably know this tim, they literally sync up  they become identical  they look like they are tracing each other ''when that happens, it is not just your mind   i always tell people, get in your head, you are dead  your mind is great for strategy, but it will never make you enjoy your life  it will never let you enjoy the taste of an apple because it will go, is this organic? where did it come from? you know what i mean? versus, your heart which can bring the juice of anything back to you ''so, what really i am trying to do with everyone in this situation is i am trying to show them how to line these up and it is really easy  so, if you want to do it right now and you want to test that it works, let us do this  tim, you can do this with me if you would like too  sure ''tony robbins  think of a situation   you might not have any in your life, tim  you are so crazy in this area and so on top of it  but, most of us have situations where there are   for all the people listening, a place where you have some unfinished business  that is the story of my life, tony ''tony robbins  okay, well the story of all of our lives, right? that i just being human, right? but, it is a place where there is something that you should have handled and you have not handled with a person or situation  it stresses you out and so what we tend to do is focus on other stuff because we do not want to have to deal with that because it is stressful  it is painful ''so, think of something that on a 0 to 10 scale, where 10 is totally stressed out and 0 is not at all, pick something that is unfinished business in your business or personal life, something or someone, and it is at least a seven, eight, nine, or a ten just so you can see that this really works  now, by the way, there are 100 s of ways to do this  i am just going to show you this one because we can do it in two minutes  so, i m hoping   tim, do you have one by chance?''tim ferriss  i do ''tony robbins  okay, perfect  you do not need to tell us the content  no one else tell us the content  alright, everyone if you would just for a moment   and i do not have any music in the background, which i do to enhance this normally, but let us just do it  put both of your hands on your heart and physically breathe deep into your heart  as you are breathing deep in your heart, feel the strength of your heart, feel the power of you heart, feel the beauty of your heart  what are you proud or grateful that your heart has guided you to do, or to give, or to feel, or to enjoy?''feel the strength of your heart  breathe into it  feel the blood flow, the oxygen  feel grateful for your heart first and think about it  you did not have to earn this heart  it was given to you  you did not have to prove your value or your worth  you did not have to accomplish anything  something loved you enough to give you the gift of life  as long as this heart is beating, you have that gift and your life  it beats 100,000 a day  it pumps blood through 60,000 miles of blood vessels  you put them end to end and they go around the earth twice at the equator  that is what is inside every one of us  you do not have to think about it  what a gift ''so, as you breathe in your heart, feeling your powerful heart, i want you just for a moment   we are going to think of three, but just think first of one event in your life, one experience, one moment that you could feel so grateful for if you wanted to ''a magic moment  a sacred moment  a sexy moment  a beautiful moment  a loving moment  any moment that really you could feel grateful for if you wanted to right now  then, step into that memory for a minute, like step in your body as if you were there  see what you would have seen then, as if you are there or hear what you would hear back then, or breathe the way you were breathing back then ''if you filled up with that sense of gratitude of that moment, how do you smile when you feel so grateful or so thankful? what is the look in your eyes? how do you breathe? what is the look in your face when you feel really, really grateful? just feel it out  fill up with gratitude  the reason we use gratitude by the way, is the two emotions that mess us up most is anger and fear  you cannot be grateful and angry simultaneously  it is the antidote ''you cannot be fearful and angry simultaneously  so, fill up with gratitude  now, think of a second moment you can feel truly grateful for and again, breathe deep in your heart  feel that power  just think of any other moment  it could be from your childhood or adulthood  it could be last week  it could be today  it could be ten years ago  any moment that you could just truly feel like that was the greatest  that was magical  that was beautiful  that is magnificent  something that give s you the feeling of tremendous gratitude if you really focused on it ''breathe it, feel it, enjoy it, fill up with gratitude  then, finally think of a third moment you can feel truly grateful for  step in it, see it, feel it, be there  feel the gratitude  what were you so great grateful for? what are you grateful for? then maybe throw one extra in ''think of coincidence  we all love when life happens for us, not to us  we love coincidences because we did not do anything  something happened for us  you were going to do one thing and you met somebody that you developed a partnership with, or became a friend, or a lover, or the love of your life, or maybe a business opportunity came from a coincidence  or an insight came from a coincidence that has been so valuable in your life  something you are grateful for  what is a coincidence that led to something that you are so grateful for? feel the gratitude for that ''was it a coincidence or were you guided? now, as you breathe in your heart   you have been doing this for about two minutes  keep breathing  keep feeling it, feeling grateful  let us use the state to solve the problem state  so, the easy way to do that is keep breathing in your heart, stay out of your head  in your heart and think about a situation that is unfinished business that stressed you out in the past  but, keep breathing this beautiful state and ask yourself this question, all i need to focus on in that suction, all i need to remember is what?''your heart knows  all i need to focus on, all i need to remember, all i need to do in that situation is what? your heart knows the answer  all we need to focus on, all we need to remember, all we need to do is   and then your heart probably knows the answer  i have done this a million times  not every one of you, but in a normal room i would say raise your hand if you got that answer and 98 or 99 percent of the people usually do, even with this simple technique  and you know what to do next '"
32,33,"33: Ramit Sethi, Part 1 ","   hello, ladies and gentleman, this is tim ferriss and welcome to another episode of the tim ferriss show  i have a very exciting episode and guest, but i am going to start with a bit of trivia and this is a slang expression and idiomatic express from argentina  from  inaudible  and i used to live in buenos aires in capital federal where i danced tango  danced my little heart out six to eight hours a day for a very long time  it was supposed to be a four week trip, ended up being nine months and i learned a lot  there is an odd mixture of italian, basically, plus spanish called  speaking spanish   there are all sorts of stuff, but this is a simple expression and it basically means, no fucking way  not even if i were drunk, technically  so, if someone were to say,  i will sell this to you for  1,000 00   and you were to respond with,  no fing way   it s  speaking spanish    speaking spanish  not even if i were drunk or  speaking spanish   so,  speaking spanish  is the expression  so, whenever somebody suggests something that you would never accept in a million years, even if you were drunk,  speaking spanish  is the response you can use  moving on to our guest  our guest is a good friend of mine, ramit sethi  we have known each other for years and he is a fascinating guy to study and a fascinating friend to have  he has attended stanford for both undergrad and master s degrees  he focused on technology and psychology and a lot of his study of behavioral change and persuasion is built into what he does now  he formally co founded pbwiki, which was a venture backed start up  then, jumped full time into boot strapping his own gig  he built up his own personal finance site to probably at this point more than 500,000 readers per month and has turned it into a revenue generating machine and i do not say that lightly  i know a lot of very, very adept business people and this is one of the most understated just monsters that is churning out revenue that very few people are talking about   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    in any case, he does believe that money is only a small part of being rich  so, we will talk about certainly the tactics  we will talk about the fact that he went from venture backed start up, to boot strapping, and what some people might derisively call a lifestyle business and most people do it in the revers  so, they will boot strap, they will generate a nice cash flow, and they will say i want to go to the big leagues and raise a ton of money and go venture backed  he did exactly the opposite and has paid off incredibly well  we will dig into how he thinks about life, how he thinks about money, the challenges he has had, as i have had, with the branding that he chose in the beginning  the titles of his books  he is a new york times best selling author, as well and we dig into a lot  so, i will let you enjoy  this is going to be a two part interview  tim ferriss   hello, ladies and gentleman, this is tim ferris  welcome to another episode of the tim ferriss show, and i am thrilled to have a good friend of mine on for grilling and i feel almost like it is the beginning for sampras versus agassi tennis match  perhaps the fourth, or fifth, or 27th time and i know there is going to be a lot of action  not to put the pressure on  ramit sethi is on  ramit, how are you?  ramit sethi   i am doing great  i am always excited to hang   tim ferriss   ramit is one of those folks that i call   not too many   for continual questions and pestering about a whole slew of different subjects  before we get started though, ramit, this is something i have always wanted to ask and i am not sure if i ever had and that is, you have ramit sethi   why is the t pronounced like a th? and the th pronounced like a t?  ramit sethi   i have   okay, i will tell you two things about my name  first of all, in punjabi the way it is written it is th, so ramith and but the actual name i was born with, was amit  which is a much more common indian name and about two days after i was born, my dad woke up, rolled over, and told my mom we cannot name him amit because his initials will be ass  and the best part is like true immigrants   my parents are from india  they went to the hospital and they did not want to pay the  50 00 change fee, so they told them that they had forgotten to add an r and they got it for free  thanks mom and dad   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   that is genius  i love it  okay, well that covers it  thank you  for those people who may not be familiar with you, what would you say to them in terms of your background, bio? and this does not have to be the cocktail   actually, i am interested  if you are at a cocktail party and somebody   i don t even know if you go to such things, but if you go to a party and someone asks you,  what do you do?  very sort of new york thing to ask, what is your answer?  ramit sethi   usually, i would say i am an author and entrepreneur  i used to say i am a writer and then the immediate response would be, oh my cousin s son is a writer  he has been working   and i was like, your cousin s son is not a write  he is unemployed  so, i switched it to author  that is true  i ve written a book called i will teach you to be rich  i run a site about helping people lead a rich life using the power of psychology and that is many areas, including personal finance, entrepreneurship, careers, and a whole bunch of other areas   tim ferriss   and i have always felt a close kinship with you or at least from the very early days because we ve both been blessed and cursed with very memorable brand names that make sure both seem like we should be on after the rotisserie chicken at 3 00 a m  in paid programing  the network does not necessarily endorse the views of tim ferris and ramit sethi with i will teach you to be rich and the four hour workweek  and it has been a hell of a process, i know, for both of us in a way to reinvent or diversify ourselves outside of what ended up, very fortunately, becoming successful products or brands or   i tend to think of it just as a book, in my case  how did you end up expanding the focus of what you do and when did you decide to do that? how did that decision come about? and i think just for perspective, if you are willing to talk about it   you do not have to get it into exact yield or anything like that, but you built a very successful business  how many employees, full or part time do you have at the moment?  ramit sethi   we have dozens and dozens of employees, mostly here in the us and around the world as well  yeah, it is funny  i started this site  it really was a personal blog  i started it in college and originally i had taken my college scholarship money, at least the first check, and invested it in the stock market  this is 1999, 2000 and i immediately lost half of that money and i was like, uh oh  that s not a good thing for an entering college student to be facing   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    so, at that time i decided to learn how money worked and i sort of went on this very long journey for many, many years to learn about investing and stuff like that  and at the same time, i was studying human behavior, social influence, and persuasion at stanford and there was a moment right around sophomore or junior year   like that book we used to read when we were kids, the emperor has no clothes  and i realized that all these experts were telling people keep a budget, stop sending money on lattes, and nobody was listening  everybody was nodding their head saying, yeah that s great advice and nobody was actually doing it  and with the background i was learning in persuasion and human behavior, i realized there are actually ways to get people to change their behavior, but it is not the kind of thing you see in mass media  it is not cutting back on  2 00 lattes or anything like that  and so my interest was in helping people lead a rich life  the fact of the matter is, personal finance   it is interesting, but it is not my life passion  it is not what i love to do  i do love psychology, so i wanted to figure out a little trojan horse and that is what originally started i will teach you to be rich  it actually was me teaching one hour classes for free on campus to my friends and when that did not work, after about a year and a half, i decided to just start a blog  tim ferriss   and when you started the blog, at what point   and i am actually astonished  i have never really dug into this  so, that is part of the fun of interviewing friends  like larry king, ask all the questions i probably should have asked four years ago  at what point did you   because you have done a great number of different things, including working for startups or with startups  what were some of the early wins or moments that convinced you or lead you to believe that you might be able to make a full time go out of either the blog or the writing a book or anything as a solo entrepreneur? and obviously, later building a company  but, what were the early indications that gave you confidence?  ramit sethi   there were two or three pivotal moments for me  keep in mind that this is a personal blog  it was so low budget that i did not make a cent for three years  i did not charge  i did not put ads  i did not want people to think i started a site called i will teach you to be rich just to make  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    money  and i also had a lot of invisible scripts or psychological barriers around selling  i think most of us do when we start  so, what happened was i started writing and i just wanted to write the best material for my friends and for people like me  and after about six months   nobody read my site for six months  in fact, you can go look at those posts right now  there are zero comments on them  i kept emailing the wall street journal and i was like a cocky college kid, so i literally said, you guys are great but you need someone who can help you relate to a young audience and i can write for you  in fact, i will do it for free  and they were like, how did you get my email address? back then people did not put their email addresses out there  so, maybe i am blessed or cursed with this persistence and   well, i call it persistence  i think they call it badgering  but, i would just email them every couple of months and i would say, hey here is an update  here is a post i wrote or i gave a talk wherever and finally   i remember it was   i believe it was december of 2004  a reporter called me and said we are doing an article on personal finance bloggers  i would love to feature you and that was pivotal moment number one  i still remember that day  i got 9,000 visitors to my site, which was a huge deal  so, that really taught me the fact that most people would have just given up and sometimes just staying in the game a little longer than others, really helps take you to the next level  the next pivotal moment   this one actually taught me that this could be a business  so, i had started writing and at a certain point i was getting a lot of readers and i just decided one day i want to try to sell something and see what happens  and again, this is all public, it is all on the site right now  you can still dig it up  i created an ebook in december 2006 called ramit s 2007 guide to kicking ass  i have a real weird thing about names, product names  it always gets me trouble  so, i had such low self esteem about anyone actually buying this, that i priced it at  4 95, which i thought was crazy  i apologized in the blog post  i said,  sorry guys, i know you could probably find a lot of this stuff for free online, but    and then i didn t have any fulfillment set up  like, if people bought it i was just going to wait for the paypal order to come in and then manually email it to them  tim ferriss   how long was the ebook?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    ramit sethi   it was like 30 pages   tim ferriss   got it   ramit sethi   and what happened was there were a lot of people that day that called me a sellout and now this actually was the beginning of a whole new chapter for me  if you have ever done anything creative, you know how much it hurts when somebody says you are a sellout or oh you are just   oh, i will teach ramit to be rich  and it was actually infuriating because i had been writing this site for free for three years, almost every day, and all of the sudden for the first time i sell something for  5 00 and i am getting this kind of flack  but, what i discovered was there were a few vocal complainers and yet hundreds and hundreds of people were buying this thing  and in fact, the people that bought it were way more likely to open it to read my material, to open emails, things like that  that was when i discovered that what is said on the surface is often very different from reality and after a while i started testing all kinds of different monetization methods and you could consider my site laboratory  i run tests at all given times and the ultimate sign for me that this was a real business was when i was making more form i will teach you to be rich than i was from my full time job, which was at a silicon valley venture backed start up   tim ferriss   and what was   just to put that on the timeline, when was that roughly?  ramit sethi   after college, i was going to go work at google  google was very nice to me  they let me take a whole summer off and then i went back to them and i was like,  during the summer i did a startup and it took off, so can i have a little bit more time?  they go,  how long do you need? like, a month?  i go,  how about two years?  they were like,  see you later   so, my negotiation kind of failed there  but, that was called pbwiki  it is still around in a form  it is called bpworks  it is an enterprise collaboration company now  so, i did that for about five years, but i continued to write i will teach you to be rich on the side and during that time, towards the end, i actually wrote the book  by that point, the site had been around for several years and i felt that i could package up what i knew into  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    one definitive piece and that was when i wrote the book, which came out in 2009  tim ferriss   remember that well  i remember that journey well  the most   one of the more masochistic exercises any human can embark upon   ramit sethi   it is the worst possible thing you can do and it is a wonder that people keep going back and doing it again and again  but, it s one of those industries where people tell you, for the love of god do not do it  you know industries like   lawyers will tell you the same thing  doctors will tell you the same thing and authors   tim ferriss   right  maybe it is   of course, as someone who has gone back to like the whipping post repeatedly, i do not know   maybe it is my own version of 50 shades of gray  i just don t have some hot woman with like a cat of nine tails, so i have to go back to publishing for just like the most unrewarding, unsexy approach to masochism  the early critical mass that you developed, your writing  you are putting out a lot of free stuff and just to echo one of your sentiments, this point i started blogging in 2007  i have written more than 500 free posts, many of them   they are all free posts   that are in some cases ten, 15, 20 pages long and i put out   i gave away some codes yesterday on facebook  these are codes that give you free audio books  and i gave away free code on facebook and half of the comments were complaining that i was only giving away one code and calling me a sellout and sleazy and i m like, wow   ramit sethi   you are such a sellout   tim ferriss   for giving away something for free  so, to those listening, if you face criticism, and you will if you have any strong opinion on the internet, ever  10 percent of the folks out there will find a way to take it personally and then a handful of those will embark upon a campaign of pain in the assery very vocally because they have   it is safe to assume, infinite time on their hands  and before you respond that you should ask yourself, do i want to pour gasoline on a fire and start a fight with someone who has nothing better to do than bitch and moan on facebook? and the answer should be no, generally speaking   ramit sethi   can we talk about this for one second?  tim ferriss   absolutely   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    ramit sethi   i love this topic  it took me three years from that first sale until i truly became comfortable selling and i really had to go through some gut wrenching horrible processes and i think that many people who may be amazing at what they do   when you first put yourself out there to sell and it could be selling your image, selling your brand, selling your vision, or even your book or product  it is so easy to get discouraged by the people around you, especially through the anonymity of the internet  so, over those three years, i had to learn how to master it because it was not the tactics that would have stopped me  like, i learned how to grow my email list to several hundred thousand people  i learned all these things, but you wake up every day and you open your comments and you just hear people saying i hate you, go back to india, what a scammer  i m like, first of all i was born in india and i have won more spelling bees that you can even fathom  so, who are we talking to here? but, what i really learned was, i had to master the psychology of learning how to handle critics because ironically the better you get, the more exposure you get, the more critics you are going to get  and that is something i did not expect  i thought they would go away, but they actually got to be more  so, i started cataloging these   i call them freeloader comments  so, there is about ten classic freeloader comments that people will say  let me give you a link  i have cataloged all of my favorites over the last few years  it is at delicious com ramitsethi freeloaders and you will just   you are not going to believe how much detail i have gone into, but this is a pet hobby of mine  i know i am a weird o  so, for example, people will be like oh my god, that is ridiculous   39 00 a month? that is crazy  maybe if it was  6 00 a month, then i would consider joining  this is a classic freeloader comment and the first ten, 20 times they said it i was like, oh my god  did i price it too high? i am   i do not know what i am doing  and then one day i was like, okay how about i will give it to you for  6 00 a month and i just decided to take a more judo approach  and of course, they either did not respond or they said well that is crazy  i am really busy right now, but maybe in three months  and so, i think it is really important to test your assumptions  there are always going to be people who are critical  frankly, in my experience, like if you commit yourself to something, you are going to become good at the tactics  you are going to become  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    good at the mechanics  but, learning how to master that psychology, especially against critics, was one of the most challenging things i had to do in the last five or so years  tim ferriss   absolutely, and just on that point because we both interact with large communities of people and when   for instance on my blog, i have about one and half million unique visitors a month and that is a large   reasonably large city and you just have to assume   or at least the way that i philosophically approached dealing with some of the craziness that comes over the transom   and you and i, i think, have developed a fairly amusing way of commiserating where when we get a really insane comment, i mean just super insane and we both get them very regularly  but, clearly insane  not   and i m not using the euphemistically  when someone is like, you are the white horseman to my children for supporting this nonprofit  like i will deliver you on judgement day and whatever  inaudible  your grandchildren that have not been born until your head explodes  i am just like what? like unbelievable  with a real email address by the way that i can respond to  i am just like, wow okay  so, i will take that and then email it to you and i will put in the subject like, hmm tempting and then   you just have to assume when you are dealing with that level of insanity that the general population mirrors the intent population  so, if you go to say san francisco, you see crazy people walking around  maybe one out of every 1,000 people is just totally bat shit crazy  they might have a semblance of normalcy, but then you kind of dig under the surface and four sentences later you realize, wow this person is very insane  they can manage their life well enough to go to a coffee shop and log onto my website, but they are totally insane and i think that give people a certain degree   gives me at least, a certain degree of comfort in knowing that it is not necessarily because you did something wrong  there is also constructive criticism when you fuck up, don not get me wrong  but, if you have a large enough audience, just assume one out of every 1,000 is going to be certifiably insane and you are going to have to learn how to contend with that   ramit sethi   yeah, yeah  i think that is exactly right  i think that it is actually a good sign that you are doing the right thing  not if you are getting overly critical comments because you have to learn   sometimes they are right  sometimes you really cross the line and i remember  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    one time i crossed the line so much that i actually had to send an apology email to my list  that was once out of thousands of emails i have sent  but, for the most part you want to listen to the critics and then decide and at a certain point, you will have seen virtually every criticism they can lob at you and you can move on because they are going to be there five years from now still complaining and you can be on doing   sharing your knowledge with the world  tim ferriss   so, i d love to rewind the clock and look at your blog and say the first 1,000 diehard fans because   so, there is an article that i refer to a lot and i think it is a very useful read for people who may get overwhelmed by the million different options presented to them in the world of marketing sales  a lot of self purported social media experts spewing off  there is a paradox of choice and people get paralyzed because they do not know where to being and i think that the article 1,000 true fans by kevin kelly   it is very short  it is available at kk org or you just search 1,000 true fans   is a great place to start  which makes the point, in effect, for people who have not read it that if you have 1,000 diehard fans, for all intents and purposes, you can probably live comfortable as an artist, whatever that means to you, on full time income if you take care of and cultivate those 1,000 people  so, think getting to that point is a real milestone for a lot of folks and maybe it is 1,000, maybe it is 2,000, but it does not have to be a million and i remember for me one of the first milestones that i hit   it took me a long time to find my voice on the blog and all that means is writing the way that i speak  actually being myself, as opposed to try to sound smart, trying to imitate other blog posts that i thought would do well  going to say 43 folders and going he formats his posts this way, i am going to imitate that  oh, i go here, they create lists of this type  i am going to do that  and it was a very schizophrenic, un unified, weird attempt when i first started and the blog was atrocious  it was the most hideous, fluorescent yellow and blue blog imaginable  people can find screen shots if they search early blog  as well as your site, no offense  but, it wasn t exactly a prom queen   ramit sethi   it was awful   tim ferriss   yes, it was terrible, but it was good enough  and one of the tipping points for me at the time was i had an article, which is very controversial still to this day, called geek to freak, how i gained  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    34 pounds of muscle in 28 days and it made the front page of digg  and at the time, digg com   d   i  g   g com   was a very big deal and drove just   i think it was thousands of clicks a minute, something along those line and of course, immediately crashed my site  i freaked out  i was in new york city at a launch and i found out that it had crashed and i viewed this as my one golden opportunity and i had fucked it up  and oh my god, i was never going to recover, but that really created a lot of buzz that set the tone  the other thing that really helped was a guest post that i did on gigaom run by om malik and i spent as much time on that guest post as i would have spent on an article for the new york times and because that is still generally rare on the internet   it sounds crazy to say, but it is true  that drove an incredible amount of dividends and it was not because a million people went from gigaom to my site  it was perhaps because a few hundred highly influential, qualified folks in silicon valley went from that article to my blog and that was enough  so, i would be curious to hear for you in the early days, what were some of those tipping points? and i also have to ask because i cannot leave it unasked, what was the one email that crossed the line and why did you have to apologize? ramit sethi   oh, man i do not remember what that email was  i wish i did, but knowing myself, i probably just said something a little too offensive  i have probably laughed at it, like this is great  but, when you start to send it out to like 25,000 people or 50,000 people   i make jokes now  i have to stop myself and   i do what is called a joke review  sometimes i have jokes that are   i think might be so offensive, i have to ask women from my team  did i cross the line on this? i have to ask people in other countries  i do not want to compromise my jokes or the way i write, but i also do not want to let a joke overcome the message  so, that is what i learned from that and since then, i have never had to do that again  for me, i agree 100 percent with 1,000 true fans  i think that was one of the seminal articles that inspired me to really build amazing material, rather than just recycling what else was out there and i knew that if i had 1,000 true fans then not only would i be able to live doing the things i wanted, but i would be able to turn that into 2,000, 5,000, 10,000 and that is exactly what happened   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    i have students of mine now who have told me literally in person  they ve said, i ve pre committed to buying anything you create at any price  which is a very unusual thing to hear  tim ferriss   that is a hell of a statement   ramit sethi   yeah, i am like, wow really? so, in my head i am like i need to create something much, much more higher priced  other students just tell me they scroll down to the bottom of my sales page, often which are 70 plus pages long, and they do not even look at the price  they just go straight to the buying  so, that is a good place to be and how did i get there? the first things i did was, 1 ) i looked around and i had a very interesting experience interning with seth godin and i watched seth and i watched the way he worked  and i realized he got 100 s of emails a day with the best stories, the best examples and that is why his books have so many amazing examples that nobody else has  same with malcom gladwell  and so i am watching him and i realized, it is very hard to be the best, but once you get there it is pretty easy to stay there or relatively easy  it is like getting into an elite college  very difficult to get in, but once you get in, you basically cannot flunk out  that really inspired me to say what can i do to become the best and go through that really tough process because once you are there, you are there  so, in terms of my first 1,000 true fans, first of all you can look at my posts  they tend to be very long, very long  in some cases, 15, 20, 25 pages long  second, i cannot recommend guest posting enough  in fact, if you search for the phrase guest post, i have an article that shows up number one and it tells you exactly how i write guest posts that grew my business dramatically and grew my readership  including one on your site  so, i did one for you   that probably took me 20 to 25 hours to write  it was very detailed  it included video, all kinds of stuff, and to this day a lot of the people i meet   i ask,  how did you hear about me?  and they say,  oh, through tim ferriss    tim ferriss   just to reiterate, now i want to come back to knowing some of the subject matter of some of the posts in the early days that really   if you did an 80 20 analysis, drove the vast majority of those first 1,000 true fans  but, just to underscore something you said and i m looking up your post right now on my blog so i can point people to  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    the actual guest post so they have an idea of what i feel is required to really put a dent in your traffic  boy, you are mentioned quite a few times on my blog  i think it was automating   ramit sethi   yes, it is called the psychology of automation   tim ferriss   the psychology of automation  if you guys go to fourhourblog com, just all spelled out, and then search automation and ramit it will pop right up  and another good example is hacking kickstarter  how to raise  100,000 00 in ten days, which was written by an entrepreneur named mike del ponte  and these posts take a long time to write  they take an extremely long time to write and the reason that is worth it is that a single blog post can change your life forever  that sounds crazy, especially in the crowded sandbox that is the world wide web, but if you take the time to do the hard thinking instead of just churning a hundred mediocre bullshit articles, you will stand out  and if you think about it strategically and are willing to put the time in to say develop relationships   relationships that can be long term and put together two to five guest posts that are truly world class  it is almost guaranteed that at least one of those will take and it can immediately change your business potential and your career trajectory, literally overnight  and i do not that that is overselling it  that is true for my blog and the blogs become the heartbeat of everything that i do  but, i would love hear from you what some of the early content was, what the subject matter was   ramit sethi   yes, i agree 100 percent  i have had three or four posts that have changed everything for me  one of those was the one on your site, the psychology of automation, building a bulletproof personal finance system  so, for me the ones that really, really stand out in the early days were all about personal finance  and again, for me i believe personal finance is a small but important part of living your rich life, but it is just a small part of it  so, i started off for the first few years writing about money  everyone has money, everyone has problems with money, they do know what they are doing  so, some of the most popular posts i wrote were   i wrote one on weddings, which was very controversial because i told people   here is what everyone says about wedding  have a small simple wedding  i want to elope  i am just going to keep it small and simple   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and yet, nobody does and so i talked about the fact that we should stop diluting ourselves and just acknowledge that we are probably going to have a big wedding  so, if that is the case, here is how much you need to save for it and the numbers were quite stark and then i led them into the rest of the automation system  now, i think this works for a couple of reasons  one   tim ferriss   do you remember the headline? i am so curious  do you remember the headline of the post?  ramit sethi   i do, it was called the  28,000 00 question, why are we all hypocrites about weddings?  tim ferriss   it is a good one   ramit sethi   i think it worked for a couple of reasons  1 ) it takes an unconventional and very brutally honest look at something that we all think or take for granted  so, there are these classic things that everyone says and yet, nobody does  like, oh yes i should go the gym  okay, but no one really goes to the gym  why not? let us talk about that  or keep a budget, which nobody does  let us talk about that  let us put it on the table  so that was one  it really shined a light on something that most of us were not doing  and then the second thing was it was a tactical, specific sliver of an entire larger discussion  so, for example, instead of you writing the post like how to build a healthy lifestyle, you wrote 34 pounds of muscle, from freak to geek   or geek to freak, 34 pounds of muscle in 30 days  that is a really specific sliver of a larger discussion and so if you can chunk out what you know into really specific slivers, that will attract lots and lots of people   tim ferriss   definitely, and to underscore that, when i am writing posts i never start out with trying to write a post that will appeal to all of my readers because the only that you attempt to achieve that is by having something so generic, non polarizing, and lukewarm that no one will hate it   well, actually people will still hate it and no one will love it  and what i prefer to do instead is to try to hit the majority of my audience, at least once every two months  and what that means is, i will try to write a post that perhaps appeals to   that i think 10,000 to 50,000 of my readers will love, just absolutely love and i do not care if the other people who come  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    to blog ignore it all together  which is why i will write about some quirky aspect of inside baseball and startups and then follow that up with a post on the seven different mechanics of power lifting and squatting  and over time, i am going to hit all of my readers and i do not feel rushed to hit them all with each post and that i think is how you develop diehard fans  you only need someone to love one of your posts to have them as a fan for a very long time  ramit sethi   that s right  do not try to get a lot of people to like  try to get a few people to love you and then do it over and over again   tim ferriss   right, exactly  and when did you make the leap   it seems like you did it pretty early  this is very self interested series of questions i am going to hit you with, but when did you make the leap to utilizing email? was that right from the beginning or is that something that you came to later?  ramit sethi   no, it is one of my biggest business mistakes is not setting up an email list for several years and in retrospect that decision cost me millions of dollars  but, it is what it is  that is the price you pay when you do not   when you are learning something for the first time  i set up an email list probably three or so years into it, maybe four and that that point i did not have any sophisticated knowledge of email  i did not even have an email service provider  when you submitted your email, it was saved in some text file somewhere and then i made the second worst mistake you can make  so, the first is not having an email list and the second is not emailing them regularly  so, people signed up and then i just forgot to email them for like nine months and then the first time i emailed them, they are like who is this spammer? like, spam  and i was like, i am not spamming  you signed up for me  but, we did not have a relationship nine months later   tim ferriss   you mean people should not wait like seven years to send their first emails? not that i know anything about that   ramit sethi   every single time i see you, you talk about you setting up an email list and at this point i just shake my head, until finally i saw the great news that you were doing it  i was so happy   tim ferris   it just took me seven years  so, sorry continue   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    ramit sethi   so, since then we have not gotten considerably more sophisticated  we have around 300,000 people on our email list  we do behavioral based segmentation  we have multiple cohorts at any given moment going through different funnels  we send millions of emails a month with multimillion different types of combinations of email funnels and we generate roughly 99 percent of our revenue through email   tim ferriss   so, just to   i apologize to pause  just to define some of those terms for folks  so behavioral segmentation would mean if someone signs up through one form and then they click on something in the first email, they go into a certain group   how is that split out?  ramit sethi   yes, well what most people do when you sign up for an email list is you sign up for an email list and they will send an email and it goes to everyone on the list  makes sense  it is pretty simple  we did that for many years  over time we found that we were expanding our list of topics to different things like psychology, entrepreneurship, and stuff  so, if you sign up to learn about starting a side business in our earn 1k funnel, probably do not care about finding a dream job at that moment, which is another funnel we have  so, based on where you sign up or what you click on or even what you open, we can determine certain things about you and then we can shunt you into the correct series of emails that are most likely for you to want and most likely for us to get benefit form as well   tim ferriss   got it  shunt, like doing arterial surgery   ramit sethi   there you go   tim ferriss   that is exciting  so, what are some of the other either best practices or common mistakes that people make? so, best practices that you have devised or common mistakes that people make when it comes to email management or email in general   ramit sethi   yes, so we do things a little differently and we are pretty rigorous about testing it and one of the things i learned is that there is a lot of best practices out there about email, but almost no one tests it  so, it s just like one   it is like the blind leading the blind  people are out there giving their best practices, but they do not really know what they are doing  so, we said look, we are going to  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    start from a fresh slate and try all these things and see what works and what doesn t  so, if you sign up for my emails you are going to learn a few things that are different  1 ) they look like plain emails  like when i send you a personal email it looks the same if you are on my list and that is because i am not trying to   i am now j  crew  j  crew is selling a brand, so their emails have to be beautiful  my emails look like i am writing to you because i want to be your friend at scale  so, that is why my emails appear to be really simple  behind the scenes there is a lot of stuff going on, but they appear to be like i just jotted you a note, which is exactly what i am writing to you  so, that is number one  tim ferriss   got it, so no header, no graphics   ramit sethi   yes, none of that  straight, simple, username, hello, and then i end like, hey talk to you soon, ramit  like that   tim ferriss   got it   ramit sethi   alright, the next thing that we learned to do is to train people to take action  and this is very counter intuitive, so most people think of their email as a newsletter  let me give you the five best posts, let me give you a digest of what is going on  we do not want to do that  we want   when you see my email or when you see anyone s email, most of the time we look at an email in our inbox and we go, like alright one more email to process  but, what i want is for people to see my email and go awesome  what crazy story does he have today? or what am i going to learn? or am i going to laugh? and so, we want them to read it first of all  that is why we talked about the design and the stories in it, but we also want them to take action  you do not want to build a list of consumers  you also want them to do something  so, we will have people reply and i tell them that i read every email, which i do  still, i read every response  we will have them fill out surveys  we will have them click a link  we will have them watch a video  the point is, if you just get them to read your email, they kind of wipe their hands together and say alright cool  you want them engaged and that turns out to make all the different   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   okay, i have to ask   so, you have dozens of employees potentially  presumably, you have couple of manager in between yourself and everyone on the front lines, but how do you with 300,000 people read all responses? or maybe am i anticipating the number is bigger than it is? how do you schedule your time so that that is possible?  ramit sethi   first of all, if you email 300,000 people you are not going to get 300,000 responses, but on a really   an email that connects with people, you are going to get many, many thousands of responses and what happens typically is that they almost all come in in the first two or three hours and then after that they trickle in  so, after a while you can look at an email and almost site read it in seconds, like typically two to three seconds because at a certain point you ve seen so many responses, you are just pattern matching  so, to go through let us say three, six, 10,000 emails   it sounds like a lot but you are working very quickly  and why do i do this? because not only do i enjoy staying close to my readers, you also get certain insights in email that you will never get in any other medium  so, let me tell you what i mean  when we send out   we do a lot of research with our readers  if i ask someone to fill out a survey, they are going to answer differently than if i ask them to fill out an email  any idea why?  tim ferriss   no, i could give a lot of guesses but i ll let you tell me   ramit sethi   an email is personal and if it is a relationship with someone, especially someone who tells them they read every email and then you know that they do, then they actually will open up their heart  they will tell you stuff they have never told anyone else  alright, so i had a very interesting woman  i asked my readers, what is one thing you claim you want to do, but you do not actually do it? and she wrote me back and said, i keep telling everyone i want to run three times a week, but i never do  and i wrote back to her and i said, why do you not just run once a week? and she goes, why would i run once a week? what is the point of that? it does not do anything  and i thought that was so interesting that we would rather dream about running three times a week, than actually run once a week and so i used that in a future email as an example   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and so people get the message that you actually read the emails and i then use that concept in a future course of mine  so, you can actually   like one insight   it is like reading a great book  one insight could change your life  so, that is the best possible place to get your insights is from the fans who have signed up to hear more from you  tim ferriss   so, this is   this brings up a complementary or alternative approach to very similar ends that people out there might be interested in  this is something that i do, which is based on the blog  so, i will very often publish blog posts very late at night  so, i will publish blog posts extremely late on west coast time  so, presumably most people on the east coast are asleep and i will put up a post   i am a night own so it does not bother me to stay up until 2 00 or 3 00 a m  and i will sit and wait and go back 60 minutes later into the comments to allow people who are oversees generally to give me feedback so that i can then address concerns  let us say one of my jokes is over the line or if the post gives an indication that it is going to be very, very controversial  i might add in a caveat or some time of preface and i will get feedback form people in other countries that i then work into the post before i promote the refined version the following day  and i will then typically read at least the first 50 to 100 comments of almost every blog post in a similar way and it is very easy for me to respond to  i use word press  i have used it since day one because i think it is very good for seo out of the box and i am very comfortable with it, which allows me to then do the same in the admin panel  as opposed to doing it on the site itself, which takes a lot longer because you are refreshing the entire page each time  but, i found that extremely useful and very critical to stem potential blow back with articles that are controversial  like, i put up a post at one point   jesus, that really, really rankled a lot of folks out there  which was about a reader   a male reader who had gone to i think it was brazil and created a swimsuit calendar and ended up marrying one of the women who modeled, did a shoot with him and blah, blah, blah and it was a very, i though, inspirational piece  it was not   i did not think it was sort of sleazy, but there were a few things that were not addressed in the piece that let people s imaginations run wild and make assumptions that were not true   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    so, it was important to catch that early and when i have not done that, you can wake up   especially with a large enough audience, to a major pr crisis on your hands when you have journalists or media or larger bloggers who are also reading your posts  in the case of email, what i would love to ask you is at this point in time, what software helps you run your life? what software and services help you run your life and business? ramit sethi   yes, so we use a lot of off the shelf software because we have a team that works remotely  we use some things, some of which are standard, some of which might be a little surprising  so, we spend most of our day in email, chat, skype, basecamp for project management, and google docs for sharing documents with people  we built some systems to be able to   like we use a lot of checklists and there is a great book called the checklist manifesto   tim ferriss   atul gawande  that s a great book   ramit sethi   yes, amazing  and it is all about how you should save   like for us, we know we have   we are cognitive misers like anyone else  we have limited cognition, limited willpower  why do we want to spend that looking for did we do this? did we do that? airline pilots use checklists because there are big risks there  we do the same for our business because we want to spend our limited creativity on the stuff that really matters  so, that is good  in terms of other business tools that work well for us, we started off our first esp or email service provider being aweber, a   w   e   b   e   r, and i think they are really good  they are great to start off with  we were there until we had about 150,000 people on our email list and we had dome some really wacky things with their software to customize it so that when one person joined, they count it as like eight leads  it was like crazy the stuff we were doing there  and finally, we realized we needed to move off of them and get onto somebody a little bit more sophisticated  we then moved to infusionsoft and we are probably going to have to make a move because in about a year we have already almost outgrown them  so, that is what we use for our email software  other things that we use, survey monkey, which is terrific for collecting responses  it is simple  it works  most of it is free or you  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   can pay a little bit for their premium service  and then along with that, we have a host of sort of back office tools that we use as well  what would some of those back office tools be?  ramit sethi   those would be things like github for managing our design process  we have a tool that we use for sharing screen shots and things like that   tim ferriss   what do you use for the screen shots?  ramit sethi   that one i am going to have to check the name on   tim ferriss   okay, no worries   ramit sethi   but, honestly, we could run 85 percent of our business using the tools i just mentioned   tim ferriss   what do you use for sharing checklists and ensuring people are using checklists?  ramit sethi   okay, so that we use google docs and in basecamp we have detailed checklist that says, did we do this? did we do this? that is less about tools and more about the mindset of if someone got hit by a bus, would we be able to do what they are doing today? and i learned that long, long time ago and so i have to say i am pretty inspired by places like mcdonalds  i do not think that we have a business like mcdonalds  in many ways, we re not as big of course, but they want to be able bring in anyone and within 30, 40 minutes, an hour, they are on the line cooking  we do not want to do that, but i am inspired by them  by the sense that if someone got hit by a bus or quit, that their system could go on  it is reproducible and so we have taken a lot of steps to make sure that we put those systems into place  and i think that is something i would challenge every entrepreneur to do  i went through a lot of challenges saying no one can do this as well as me or no one can do that  like at this point, i do not even know how to send an email to my own email list  someone else does it  i have no idea how it works   tim ferriss   you are going to arrive at the office or at your house and be locked out, fired from his own company  a couple of other tools people might helpful   i also use basecamp and a lot of people use basecamp  i think it is a great tool  i also use asana and i have been experimenting a lot with asana, which is an interesting  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    alternative to basecamp that was co created by dustin moskovitz, co founder of facebook  i do not use google docs much, partially because i spend a lot of my time offline working and i have been frustrated in the past when i have been unable to access google docs  so, i would love to come back to that and get your two cents on it  the checklist manifesto, definitely checklists are hugely important  one of the approaches that i take   and i did this after i had to fire an assistant, which for something very egregious and i realized that   not all certainly, but a lot of the processes and preferences and checklists were in her head  now what, right? and it was a real pain in the ass to then have to get someone else and running and try to recall what was missing and i found a screenflow and dropbox very helpful for that  so, i will do a screenflow using that software of the same name and speak as i am capturing a screenflow of me, for instance, moderating comments to show i moderate, what type of comments go where, how i deal with grey cases that are questionable for any number of reasons and so on and so on  and i then put these into dropbox into basically a process folder and that is accessible to anyone who may work with me who needs to see how something is done  which i have found very, very helpful  survey monkey, definitely  they bought a company called wufoo  i have used wufoo and survey monkey both for a very long time  in the case of google docs, do you have   what do you use for chat? is there any particular tool you use for chat? ramit sethi   we just use google chat and we might do one of these more corporate tools like yammer or something like that  i have been hearing good things  what about you? do you use anything like that?  tim ferriss   i do not use chat currently much  there are a few exceptions  if i am dealing with developers, typically or designers particularly overseas i will use skype  and i do like skype due to the encryption for a host of reasons and the ease of file transfers  i get a little edgy if i have too much of my data on any one company s services and google would certainly fit that bill  but, i    copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    ramit sethi   let me give you a couple other tools that we use as well   tim ferris   yes   ramit sethi   this is for the more technically minded crowd  if you have a website, we use visual website optimizer to run a lot of different tests   tim ferriss   that is great  as do i actually recently, yes   ramit sethi   yes, that is a great one  so at any given moment we are probably running five plus tests on our site and of course we are testing many more versions of things in our emails  we recently started using an interesting tool called umbel  this is more    tim ferriss   how do you spell that?  ramit sethi   it is u   m   b   e   l  it is more of an enterprise level software  if you have a lot of fans or email subscribers or something like that, it allows you to look in and see their social profiles and learn about your audience  who are they? what are their demographics? how much do they make? what are the interested in? things like that  that is a cool way  personally, my favorite way is just to ask them  so, a lot of time we will just send an email saying, hey would you mind sharing a little bit of information  and here is a cool way to do it, let us say you have a few thousand people on your email list  your blog readers or whatever, you can just send them a link which automatically redirects them to one of three different survey monkeys or you can just post survey monkey one, two, or three  in this way you can get a lot more responses pretty quickly  we tend to limit our surveys to about five questions  so, if we send an email out  we can fill up four or five survey monkeys in a matter of minute and we want to ask things like who are you? what are your biggest challenges? what have you tried to do to solve x? and when i do surveys, i love qualitative responses  so, survey monkey is great for that   tim ferriss  ramit sethi   now, when you say survey monkey one, two, three, and four  why are you   why do you have four different surveys? because i do not want to have to create a survey with 20 questions  no one is going to fill that out and so i would rather create four  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    different surveys with five questions and send it to a bunch of different people  tim ferriss   i see, so those   you have four sets, hypothetically, of five questions and you are just splitting your list up into four different segments   ramit sethi   exactly   tim ferriss   got it  yes, that makes a lot of sense  how do you think   of course i just started emailing, so i am actually a bit of a funny case because i have absolutely no experience really emailing, yet i have big enough numbers to make catastrophic mistakes and then just suffer the wrath of god s tsunami of regret if i do anything wrong, which is very anxiety producing place to be needless to say  it is like, oh great  you have had a week of gymnastics  you are going to be in the finals at the olympics tomorrow  good luck  and i would be curious to hear   i do not know if you have seen any of the stuff that i have sent out, but what would you change? what would you improve or test with how i am approaching things currently?  ramit sethi   well, one of my general life philosophies is do not try to be 40 before you are 40   tim ferriss   i just turned 37  i am in no rush to get there  i do not think that is what you mean   ramit sethi   it is funny how many of us we want to jump ahead and do all of these really sophisticated things and i am no exception  every time i starts something new, i want to start to what all the best people in the world are doing and try to copy them  but, of course, you have to go through the pain and the fire to be able to get there and i think email is a great example  right now you have a huge list, a huge amount of people  i have seen your emails  i am on your email list  i think they are great  i think they are a great way to start  ultimately, having known you and having read all of your stuff, i think people want to hear your voice in the emails and one of the classic things when people start off, they just list   here is a list of all the things i have been writing about or stuff like that  and i think that is a fine way to get your feet wet, but ultimately i would like to hear the stories of what you have been doing  i would  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    like to hear more narrative  i would like to get inside your life a little bit  what is the life of tim ferris? this mysterious, charming man  tim ferriss   i will give you mysterious  charming is definitely tbd  cool, anything else come to mind?  ramit sethi   let me tell you one best practice that people share as if it is the law of god, but it is actually not true at all  so, there is this movement, particularly in silicon valley but everywhere, where people say everyone has too many emails  people are just   they want to get to inbox zero  so, if there is one thing to know, it is quick to the point, quick, quick, quick  write your email, five sentences or less and that is just not true at all  we know it  we have tested it experimentally  we know it for a fact  many of my emails are 10, 15 pages long  in fact, there is a very sophisticated marketer who wrote even longer emails and people said to him, who reads this stuff? would anyone even read to the end? who does it? and he laughed and then he said, only the buyers  okay, and the point is    tim ferriss   that is a very alec baldwin response   ramit sethi   yes, if your material is good, if it is engaging, there is almost no maximum you can write  for example, some of my sales pages, 72 pages long  who reads that? plenty of people read it and they scroll to the bottom, they find the one link that says buy, and they click it  so, my point is not write longer  it is, do not worry about space  if you have a compelling piece of copy and if you have a relationship, people will read it  so, do not worry about short bullet points  none of that is relevant  just worry about writing the best stuff you can   tim ferriss   definitely, and i want to reiterate just hopefully for clarity with people and feel free to correct me, but what ramit is saying is not make your stuff as long as possible  the way that i am hearing it, at least, is the way that i approach my books, although i might have to modify it because they are growing at an alarming rate in length  but, the blog posts, the email, whatever it is, should be as long as it needs to be  that is it  and so one of my concerns, i suppose, with  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    the personal stories or narrative is that if i do not have really concrete how to take away and tactical stuff in that email, that it will come off as too self indulgent and that i will have massive unsubscribes  particularly with new people who have subscribed and do not have a deeper familiarity with my story or the books and so on  how would you respond to that? ramit sethi   there is some element that is true to it  look, first of all, you probably are self indulgent  you are sitting here talking about yourself and me for two hours  i mean, who could be more selfindulgent than us right now? and i love it  but, beyond that, i think that   i had the same thing  so, if you go back and look at my early posts, they are very tactical and i think that is awesome  but, someone said to me years ago   they said,  ramit, tactics are great, but tactics become commoditized   what ultimately connects with people is getting into their emotions and their psychology  and i was very resistant to this  i was like, you do not understand my tactics are world class, blah, blah, blah  but, over time i came to realize that she was exactly rights  tactics matter, of course  tools matter  but, to ultimately connect, psychology matters  so, for your i actually think people would love to hear the stories of lessons you learned, failures you had, what happened this weekend, and interesting insight that came up  if you look at any columnists, they are not always sharing  howto s  a lot of times they are just sharing interesting ideas  one other thing, do not be worried about unsubscribes  we monitor it, but we do not measure it  in the sense that, if someone unsubscribes, you know what? it is my gift to you and it is your gift to me  i would not want to waste someone s time and i do not want them to waste my time either  in fact, i regularly encourage to unsubscribe  i put the link right there  i say, look if this is too much  if this is too involved for you, here  maybe we are not right for each other  unsubscribe and it actually causes a huge spike because people are like, what the fuck? who has the   who says that? but, the people who stay are actually highly committed   tim ferris   yes, what is so paradoxical about my concern about unsubscribes is that i regularly call my readership on the blog all the time  so, i will   if i am getting particularly fired up or have my knickers in a  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    twist about something and i have just had a long day and maybe too many glasses of wine  i am like, you know what? i am going to write a blog post and i am going to put a couple of fucks in there, just a couple of extra fucks because i am so tired of people chastising me for my language  and i used to have a rat tail  i am from long island  give me a break  and so, i ll write a post with an extra few fucks in there just so that if someone is easily offended by that stuff, they effectively opt out of visiting the blog because i do not want to deal with their mom like scolding  and part of the reason i am comfortable with that is because it does not give me a concrete number is a user interface or a dashboard on aweber or elsewhere that is like you had x number of people leave and unsubscribe and it has been kind of psychologically fascinating to see how it is tempting for me to be more conservative, much more conservative, with email that i am in my blog posts because of that precise number that it gives me as feedback  ramit sethi   it is a good sign   it is a good reminder that not all data is good data and that often the most productive thing you can do is stop looking at data  for example, for my investments, i do not check my investments except once every six to 12 months  you should not be looking at your investments every day  that is crazy and it is actually doing you a disservice to do that  same thing with unsubscribe rates  it is crazy  you need to be focusing on growing your list, writing amazing stuff, and probably revenue per email  that is a great measure if you are growing your business  unsubscribes, that is going to drive you crazy  it serves no real purpose   copyright

33,34,"34: Ramit Sethi, Part 2 ","   hello, ladies and gentleman  welcome to another episode of the tim ferriss show  this is tim ferris  what you are about to hear is part two of a two part conversation with ramit sethi  he is an entrepreneur, he has tried venture backed, now he is going selffunded boot strapped  he is a behavioral change and persuasion expert and also a very good friend of mine  if you did not catch the first part, you might want to do that before venturing in  if you do not mind your stories as more of a jigsaw puzzle, then by all means, keep on listening and we tend to bounce around quite a lot  so, i think that you could almost listen to them in reverse order and still get a lot out of it  but, for the background context and so on, part one has a lot of that  and now, without further ado, please enjoy part two, the final part of the tim ferris show with ramit sethi   ramit sethi   now, so the revenue per email   tim ferriss   i am your quintessential case of reticence to monetize and of course i have been ridiculed for years by many friends because of this, which is fine  my general approach to date has been it is either free or it is really, really high end and very expensive and i think a good example of that was otk, opening the kimono  that event that i said was going to be one time and at least to date it has only been one time and it was   depending on when people signed up, it was between  7,500 00 and  10,000 00 a seat and it sold out from one blog post  and i remember i was talking to someone about event management, somebody who does this for a living, someone who is putting on events once a quarter, making a lot of money from the events or so i thought  and i asked her at one point what she would to do to fill an event with between 120 and 200 people at this given price point  she said, well you are going to have to hire a full time person to do the following 12 things  you are probably going to have to pay for the following type of marketing and  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    outbound and this and that and the other thing  and all it took was one blog post  now, the way that i explained that is that i have given away so much free content and value, 100 s of books worth of content on the blog that i have established a level of trust with my audience, so that when i finally offer something for sale they understand and assume i have given a lot of thought, which is true  do you think that s a foolish approach? ramit sethi   no, i think it is great  i gave away 98 percent of my material for free and then for many of my flagship courses, they are extremely expensive  in fact, ten to 100 times what my competitors charge  so, i love the idea   in fact, i will even take it one step further  a lot of times people they would come to me and say, that is ridiculous  maybe if it were  30 00 and i just smiled because i do not play in the  30 00 sandbox  i do not want to play there  i would rather give it to you for free than play in the  30 00 sandbox  and i think it is very important when you think about pricing and positioning   it is very important to think what does this mean for you? it is the same reason where if you go to the farmer s market and you see a guy selling a t shirt  he is selling it for  25 00 and you go in there and say i will give you  3 00  look, the guy is probably still making a profit on  3 00, but why is he going to laugh you out of his store and just turn his back on you? why? because he does not want to play in the  3 00 sandbox and he would rather just say a blanket no, than even make a small amount of revenue  so, i really love the idea of give away as much as you can for free, but do not be afraid to aggressively sell  we are unapologetic about how aggressive we are because we have done the testing and we know that it works  so, we sell at high price points and we sell when we sell  and i could share stories of how we have done that and all that stuff, but i think you should be unapologetic about that   tim ferriss   so, let us take a real case then, something that i have been considering but i have been very hesitant about and i have been considering this for a long time  i know that you are probably kind of laughing to yourself because every time we meet up i am like, you know i have been thinking about this thing and my god  jesus christ, stop thinking about it and either do it or do not  it is a very sensitive ground for me  so, i have considered doing a course  but, even that term i get kind of antsy around  i have been  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    considering trying to do an experiment whereby i try to take the adherence rate with say the four hour body and slow card diet and so one, which is very high  we have tracked it against multiple other diets  we have done randomized testing and launch  inaudible  studies looking at basically out of every 100 people, how many fail and quite on different diets  and the slow card diet has a very, very high adherence rate  and of course, the good program you follow is better than the perfect program that you quite  so, looking at the behavioral science side of things  a fantasy of mine is to take   let us just say   this is an arbitrary number, but 1,000 to 2,000 people and try to experiment on those people and charge them for it, but in sort of a tight knit private community with a bunch of stuff to try to get that number as high as possible  the sort of adherence and conversion rate as high possible for   i don t know  probably a four to eight week period  if i were to do something like that, and if you think there is a better idea i would love to hear it, but if i were to do something like that how would you suggest i approach in a way that i do not get lumped in? because we both know there are a lot of folks out there who are just super scammy folks in the internet marketing world  how can i avoid getting lumped into that because i feel like that would do more damage to me than any revenue to be derived from such a product? what are your thoughts there? ramit sethi   this is something that i struggle with myself because i do not want to be lumped  the name of my site is i will teach you to be rich and i have online video courses  that range anywhere from a couple of hundred bucks to  12,000 00 for some high end stuff  how do i prevent myself from being one of those guys with two thumbs up in front of a jet that is actually rented, being towed away as we speak, you know?  tim ferriss   wolf of wall street style   ramit sethi   yes, i have seen the dark side of this industry and it is simultaneously disgusting and hilarious  the stories i could tell you are unbelievable   tim ferriss   so, how do you do that? how do you maintain your integrity and still sell?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    ramit sethi   i think there is a few things that i learned  1 ) is, you are in total control  so a lot of people said i do not want to write long form copy or i do not want to have to write those sales letters that have the yellow highlight in it  and my answer was, you do not have to do that  you can do whatever you want  there is a reason people do that  i think it is worth learning, but you do not have to do that  the next thing is, you can choose who you allow to join your material  so, i make it   when i first started i was like the classic novice seller where i was like, hey guys here is ten reasons that you should join  please, please, please join  it will be so great  come on  we will be friend  and nobody wants to go to a party where someone is begging you to come   tim ferriss   right   ramit sethi   in a recent launch we did, over one million people saw our launch and we had fewer than five complaints about price  not 5 percent, but five and this was a very high priced product  why? because i am very selective about who i allow  i will give you an example  i always wanted to run a business my way, not just appealing to anyone  so, one of the things i do is i prohibit anyone with credit card debt from joining my flagship courses   tim ferriss   how do you   now, this is an interesting point  i was going to ask this earlier  how do you sort of mechanistically or process wise, how do you do that? because this is a super important point   ramit sethi   yes, so   let me tell you about the decision and then i will tell you what happens   tim ferriss   sure   ramit sethi   so, there is a well known sushi restaurant in san francisco and it always has a line out the door and if you are not there by 7 30, you are not getting in  and when i finally got in for the first time, i am like looking around like a weird o  i always want to optimize stuff and they have like so much empty space in the restaurant  first thing i do, i do not sit down and look at the sushi, i am like if they added four tables they could increase revenue 25 percent because i am a nutcase  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved     00 09 04   and what i realized was they just do not care  they do not   revenue is not their primary goal  they want to run the business the way they want and i loved that  i loved that i can run a business and tell people who i do not want, you are not right for this material  and so i reframed it in my mind form begging people to   look, i would love to serve the right people, but i am not looking for everyone  i am just looking for the right people  so, the decision to not allow people with credit card debt to join my flagship program, that cost me over  2 million a year, but i think it is the right thing to do  ethically, i do not think that they would be buying it if they knew what was best and also i have always told them  use my free material, pay off your debt, come back  i will still be here  i have been here ten years  i will be here for the next 20  so, we use a combination of carrot and stick  carrot, i explain to them why  i do not need an extra  1,000 00  it is not going to make a difference in my lifestyle, but it would be great for them to take that money and put it toward their debt  and i explain why in the context of why i am doing this and all of that stuff  the stick is if they join anyway and i find out, not only will i refund their money, but i will ban for life and to my knowledge, no one else does this  but, it is important to me and i always wanted to run a business the way i wanted to  so, once we did that, we saw a very, very dramatic shift in the type of customers that were joining my programs  it trickles down to every part of the organization  we have a higher open rates, higher adherence rates, better customer service emails  and when people hear it the first time, they are like what? it is a very un american thing to be told you cannot buy, but for my needs and ultimately i think for theirs   i think i am doing it out of service to them  they should not be buying my course  they should be paying off that debt and then coming back   tim ferriss   how do you find out   how many people are on that banned list roughly?  ramit sethi   oh, a lot, a lot  it is called dns, do not sell  i take great pleasure in adding people to that list because like i gave you a chance  you disobeyed my rules and now i am sorry  you do not get to join anymore   tim ferriss   how do you decipher that they have gone   that they have actually  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    gone into debt to purchase the product? is it because they stop paying on multiple   ramit sethi   yes, there is a few ways  there are a few ways  there is a couple that i will not mention publicly  but, i will tell you that of the people who ask for a refund because all of my courses   i am so confident about them, you can take the entire course and ask for a refund  but, we believe that most people do the right thing  if they get value out of the course, they stick with it, and that is why we have been able to grow and continue getting people to join  fully 40 percent of those people who refund, do it because they have a debt problem  so, those people are banned forever   tim ferriss   what do you think of an approach just to avoid that? because that is one of my nightmare scenarios is someone going beyond their means and digging an even deeper whole for themselves by going into debt for something that they really shouldn t be given their financial position  spending money on   for otk, i had an application process and we turned a lot of people, but i really dug into the finances and so it would ask questions like do you have at least  50,000 00 in savings in the bank  because this was a product, keep in mind, that was an event that was  10,000 00 for some folks  and secondly, we did not take any credit cards  you had to wire the money and with the combination of those two approaches a number of things came to light  number one, you have the have the money to wire it  so, there is that  secondly, if people said no i do not have x amount of savings, then we would politely tell them that we did not want them to come to the event because it would put too much of a strain on their finances  and we asked questions like, would you feel a high degree of pressure   would you feel a lot of pressure to make the price of this event back in the subsequent six months? if they answered yes, then nine times out of ten they were out  the other thing i did for an event at least   and maybe this does not apply to online, but i suspect that it does because people are even more of a pain in the ass when it is virtual  if people got really uppity in their responses   i remember one guys said, yes i have plenty of money  if you and your financial nanny want to see my jet on the tarmac when i come, you are welcome to check it out  and i was like thank god for that dick response because now you are not going to be able to behave that way at the event  goodbye  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and that was the end of that guy  but, is there a way that you would improve upon that process? or what do you think of taking that approach? where there is no   ramit sethi   i love it and i still remember it to this day and i really admired you for doing that because so few people will  and ironically when you stopped chasing the raw dollars and you start chasing something a little bit more meaningful than that  like in your case, you wanted to get the right audience  in our case, we want the exact same thing  we want true behavioral change  then ironically, you will have more money than you ever know what to do with  i think that is a great approach  i do think that when we first instituted this, i had a lot of angry people tell me, who are you tell me what i can spend my money on? blah, blah, blah and one of the things i learned is that if a lot of people are telling you something   like, i am happy to blame one person if they are really rude to me  but, if 20 people are rude to me, it is probably my fault  so, i looked at the copy and i simply had not explained why they could not join  i just said, credit card debt is bad, blah and understandably people got upset  so, i learned how to refine the message  it took us about six months and those questions have vanished  they just went away  so, i love the application, especially for something expensive  if it is like  100 00 i probably would not do something like that  i would just tell them the rules  but, i think it is   for anyone listening, whether you are starting a business, whether you have children, whatever it is you are doing, people want boundaries  we want boundaries and it takes a very high status person to be able to say this is what i am looking for and this is what i am going to put up with  and if that is not right for you, that is okay  maybe we are not right for each other  and i think you become so much more appealing once you do that   tim ferriss   well, i think you need   i think human beings and certainly speaking for myself, need constraints to be productive or even happy for that matter  and i think the checklist manifesto is a great example of that  you do not want to have infinite options for every action and by creating constraints, whether it is for writing, whether it is for art, i think you can dramatically improve your creative output and your general sense of satisfaction when you  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    very artfully and strategically create constraints for yourself  i think of things like the pomodoro technique, for instance  23 minutes on with a break afterwards  provides structure within which you can be more effective than if you are willy nilly in a very vague sense trying to do    be productive   just to shift gear somewhat completely, you mentioned something earlier that i have never really asked you about or brought a questions to mind  you mentioned that people have said to you, go back to india  and needless to say, i have never received   even though i am of danish decent  i am a european mutt  i do not get go back to denmark very much  how does race factor into your life at all? if it does  i m curious  ramit sethi   this is a good question  we haven t talked about this before   tim ferriss   no   ramit sethi   very interesting  so, i think it effects a lot of the ways i think about things  i was raised with two immigrant parents, from india  pretty traditional household  my mom stayed home with four kids  my dad went to work and we went to temple pretty frequently  things like that  i have a certain outlook on life thanks to my parents and my family  like a few things, my family is   like being very honest about stuff  like, indian people   or pretty much anyone, except for in america   if you are overweight and you get off the plane, the first thing they are going to say is wow you got fat  like it is like point blank and the truth is, you did get fat  so, that brutal honestly   the first couple times you hear it, you are sensitive  but, at this point, you cannot change a culture  not overnight and not one person and so appreciate that honestly and you will find that a lot in my material  it is like, looks let us just call it for what   let us call it out and let us call it what it is  and i am not saying that i am going around to people saying you are fat  i am saying that if you cannot afford something, let us just talk about that and be honest about it or conversely, if you want a  1,000 00 jacket or pair of shoes and you can afford it, awesome  who cares what people think? let me show you how to get it  i think that played a role  i learned how to negotiate  from a young age my mom was taking me to like macy s and showing me how to negotiate there  i am  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    not kidding  it is awesome  tim ferriss   macy s? that is great  most people would assume that just would not work if you go to a big box   ramit sethi    inaudible  to this day  she would be like, don t talk to that lady  she is too experienced  you can tell  go look at that one  she looks new  go try it with her  i am like, alright  so, i learned that and then just in general i think a lot of ideas about service and wanting to give back  and i think probably some of the most popular things i write on my site are about the crazy things my mom and dad do because they are indian  like, for example, my mom trying to set me up with everyone  my dad who took my resume, which i was trying to get an internship in college  he took my resume and changed my major to computer science  he literally changed it  i m like, dad, i am not in computer science  and he just did not respond  i am like, legit   tim ferriss   that is really funny  so, i remember a post that put up on the blog some time ago  it was guest post called how to negotiate like an indian  and we have kind of talked about some of this stuff, just kind of culturally  there are definitely some differences and some patterns you can spot, in certain cultures  just like you mentioned being called out as fat  as it turns out, pretty much in any non english speaking or non natively english speaking country that i have bene too, that is the case, right? you go to china and they are like  speaking chinese   they are like   and they will just point blank, especially the chinese  or you go to   you are fat and you go to south american  man, if they think you are on the same team   meaning you look slightly latin, you are going to be like, gordita, gordita  you are going to be called fat  it is just that is going to be your nickname in a lot of cases  but, when this post went up i had a lot of people come out of the woodwork and they are like, that is racist  and the fact of the matter is, it was a very complimentary post and if you look at the stats, at least last time i checked it out   in the case of indians, they have founded more engineering and tech companies in the us form like  97 to 2007 than immigrants from britain, taiwan, china, japan combined   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    i have been really impressed with tie, the organization in silicon valley  the  inaudible  entrepreneur, which is just amazing  how do people respond to your commentary on sort of the   you are indian, so of course you have sort of license to talk about growing up indian and all of these cultural idiosyncrasies  but, do you get a lot of flak for it or do you not? and i am curious why or why not? ramit sethi   that is a great question and no, not really  i get it only from journalists who are in a way trying to stir things up, asking like was this   is this an issue for you? and the answer is no  people get it  so, let me give you some examples of things that i talk about as an indian person  i talk about negotiating like an indian  i talk about how when i would go to buy a car, when my dad would go to buy a car for our family   most people walk in and walk out  we spent three days there  i am not joking  we would eat breakfast at the dealership  we would negotiate all day, then my dad would say this is too much  we are going home  and we would leave and then we would go back the next day  and in fact, speaking of like indian terms, here is a really funny one  if you google how to raise a financial wizard  the new york times did an article and they have my parents picture right there  take a look at the ur  the url was originally how to raise a financial guru, but they thought it would be too offensive  so, the url persists, how to change a financial guru, but they changed the title how to raise a financial wizard  my take is look i am not going to comment on race relations or anything like that  i think that the indian community is amazingly strong  i joke about being asian sometimes  i have a side site called yoursurrogateasisanfather com  you have not seen that before  i have never publically mentioned it  but, i tell people like as a joke, look i am your surrogate asian father and what i mean by that is we all want someone who will tell it to us straight  who will tell us when   you know what? you did a good job, but i do not think you did your best  or that was amazing and we should celebrate  actually, no asian father would ever say that last part  they would only say, you did not get an a plus, what is wrong with you? which is the correct way in my opinion  so, it is partly joking, but i think we all kind of   like, i have  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    people who are jewish, i have people who have latin parents and they all kind of get it  whether it is asian or not, we all kind of get having that one uncle who is like never quite satisfied, but you know that he supports you and he loves you  and i think that is exactly what i will teach you to be rich is about  tim ferris   man, great stuff  okay, i am just going to bounce all over the place  i am going to throw some random questions are you  the first is, when you think of the word punchable who is the first face   whose face comes to mind?  ramit sethi   i cannot tell you that  i cannot say that out loud   tim ferriss   why not?  ramit sethi   i will be in big trouble   tim ferriss   nobody is listening  it is just    ramit sethi   no, they are definitely listening  i can tell you that for 100 percent fact  they know who they are  i cannot say it  you know who they are   tim ferriss   okay, alright we will switch that then  when you hear the word successful, who is the person that you that you think of?  ramit sethi   i think of   there is a guy i recently met, his name is mark bustos, b   u   s   t   o   s  he has an awesome instagram account  he is a very high end hair dresser in new york  he works at like a top salon and on the weekends he goes and he cuts the hair of homeless people around new york and he records it and he writes about their stories  and i think it is so amazing that he is at the top of game as a hair dresser working with celebrity clients and things like that, and then on the weekend   on his one day off he goes around and is of service to people who ordinarily would never have the chance to get their hair cut, especially by somebody like him  so, i think he is a great guy   tim ferriss   that is amazing  how did you come across him?  ramit sethi   i heard about him at that salon and then i saw him on instagram and then i just started seeing news article after news article about him  and it turns out, he is a pretty big thing  his story got out and i am so glad it did   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   that is amazing  i will have to check it out  what book or books have you given out most as gifts, besides your own?  ramit sethi   there was a point where   there is a point where any author walks around with a backpack of their own books and when   and no matter what, when they meet someone, within ten seconds this author will tell everyone in the world that they just came out with a book  the next question is  oh do you have a copy? oh, as a matter of fact, i just happen to have ten copies on my back right now   tim ferriss   that is kind of like what about bob? i do not know if you remember there is a scene in what about bob that i appreciate more every year as just a work of genius  but, there is a part where   why am i blanking on the actor s name? but, the psychiatrist is in his office in new york and he is like,  there is a great new book that just came out   he is like,  let me see   and it is a shelf all of his one book with the spines facing out and he is pretending to look like,  let me see, ah yes here it is   and he pulls it out  but, anyway, i digress   ramit sethi   so, i will give you two favorite books that i really love  one is called mindless eating  it is amazing  it is a book about food, but it is actually about psychology and we all eat and we all think we know why we eat what we do  but the answer is most of us have no idea and if you can understand this, you can understand so many other parts of why you act the way you do  so, that is number one  number two is an old throwback  this is a book i believe from the early 20th century  it is called the robert collier letter book and it is an amazing book on copywriting and really how to understand human behavior and human drive  and it has famous ads from many, many decades ago with an explanation of why they worked  i think it is really powerful and those lessons are timeless  people will never change  these lessons will never change  it is amazing   tim ferriss   i am astonished i have never heard of that one  at least for a period of time, fashioned myself kind of an astute student of copywriting  that is very cool  glad to have a new one  if you   also on the book subject, if you were to take let us just say a handful of 30 year olds who have had a bit of success  they have been out in the world for a while, decently intelligent, and you are going to receive  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    10 percent of their future earnings  but they are going to become entrepreneurs for the first time  what books would you give them if you had   if you could only give them three books, what books would you give them? ramit sethi   oh, boy  let me think about that  i can tell you the areas that they would be  so, one of them would be age of propaganda by pratkanis and this is a cousin, you could say, related to the book influence by cialdini many people have heard of  the age of propaganda is less known  that and his other book, social animal are outstanding books on human behavior and it is interesting that so many of us focus on our technical skill, but ultimately being able to understand why we do the things we do and why other people do the things they do is so much more powerful  so, those would be two of them  those are psychology books  and as for the third one, i am going to have to think about that   tim ferriss   okay, we will come back to it  now, i do not want to let you off the punch question so easily  so, i am going to change it  when was the last time you were punched in the face?  ramit sethi   indian people do not get punched in the face, dude   tim ferriss   you are just too fast? you pull a matrix?  ramit sethi   they do not get in fights  we are doing spelling bees  we are not getting fights  you are like the mr  jock  we do not do that  i know you   we are sitting there studying three hours a day   tim ferriss   alright, alright  there is actually an amazing   if for you people out there who self identify as americans, check out a documentary called two million minutes and it basically compares high school students, a hand full in the us and a handful in china and a handful in india, and it will strike terror into your heart  it is insane how intense the students are who are profiled from china and india  it is just like an olympic training center of spelling bees and music and so on  it really made my jaw drop to see the discrepancies   ramit sethi   awesome, thanks for the rec   tim ferriss   yes, really, really pretty wild  speaking of documentaries, do you have any favorite documentaries that you can recommend to people?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    ramit sethi   yes, the classing one that i refused to watch for so many   for like a year and then finally i did was jiro dreams of sushi   tim ferriss   so good   ramit sethi   i mean so good and look, the lesson behind it was if everyone tells you something, it is probably true  i remember one day i was getting out of the shower, i had no music, i did not feel like listening to it and i just put that thing on  it was on netflix and within ten minutes i was transfixed  and so my thing is if everyone tells me, it is probably true  and it was amazing just to look at the level of almost obsessive focus on mastery of just one thing  like, ten years to learn how to make rice  i do not want to do that, but i want to learn about it and maybe do it for my own life skill   tim ferriss   what was your favorite part of that movie? i have one particular scene that jumps to my mind  what   do you have a particular part in that movie?  ramit sethi   yes, there is two  the rice thing was revelatory for me because   i thought i knew what it takes to be good, but he showed me what it meant to be great and ten years before you get to touch the rice  that was astonishing to me  the second thing was chef jiro, he finds out if you re right handed or left handed and that way he can serve the dish appropriately for you  that is a level of detail that i think we do not see too frequently in our day to day lives and yet, at the highest levels it is just routine and it just opened my eyes to what could possibly be   tim ferriss   yeah, it is so amazing  of course, my first real overseas experience was a year as an exchange student in japan and have a longstanding love affair with japan and just endlessly fascinated by the culture and go back often  every culture has its very weird and in some cases, unappealing parts  but, japan is a very eclectic mish mash of sort of absorbed influences and very old traditional influences  i went to his younger son s sushi restaurant and we went extremely early and we got to spend about an hour and half just us, there were four us, with him and i was the official translator  it was just a fantastic experience and you mentioned the left and right hand and i do not know if you recall that the youngest son s sushi restaurant is an exact mirror image of his father s sushi restaurant because one of them is right handed and one is left  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    handed  ramit sethi   oh, wow   tim ferriss   and the scene in that movie, there are two that sort of stood out, but the one that really stands out is when a customer comes in and is asking what else they have and he is asking do you have appetizers? and he says, no we do not serve appetizers  like, do you have this? and he is like, no we serve just sushi  that is it  very unapologetically and if you want to talk about someone who just gives zero fucks about the scaling a business  he could have a 100 seat restaurant and he would   it is like ten to 12 seats in a subway station  just amazing  any other documentaries?  ramit sethi   none that come to mind  that is my favorite   tim ferriss   james bond or jason bourne and why?  ramit sethi   jason bourne   tim ferriss   why?  ramit sethi   you know what? i think that by the time i was born and watching james bond movies, i had missed the decades of james bond allure and jason bourne is just cool  he is the best  he is just a cool guy  i love it   tim ferriss   i think i identify   i aspire to have all the skills of jason bourne, but i most identify   i would say at least once a week, i feel like he did in the first movie when he has his outburst in the car and he is like,  i do not know who i am  i cannot remember what happened  i do not know why i am here   i think that is primarily why i identify with him so much   ramit sethi   love it   tim ferriss   dogs or cats?  ramit sethi   neither   tim ferriss   neither?  ramit sethi   no way   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   explain   ramit sethi   well, when i was a kid my sisters wanted a dog, but we could not get one because my dad is allergic to dogs and then seven years later we found out he is not allergic at all  he just does not want dogs  and i was like, i applauded  i was like this is the longest lie i have ever heard  it was beautifully executed and i cannot wait to do that to my own kids   tim ferriss   but why do you not like pets?  ramit sethi   why do i want them around? i just never grew up with them  they seem like a lot of responsibility and work  i do not need the love of a dog or cat   cats do not even love  i do not need the love of an animal in my life  so, i am good  it is kind of like i see these dogs   i like watching them on the street  i like watching them meet  i have an intellectual curiosity in them, but i am good   tim ferriss   you mentioned    ramit sethi   is that weird?  tim ferriss   it is not weird if you did not grow up with pets  i do not think it is an unusual response  i think a lot of americans grew up with pets  i grew up with two dogs and four cats  i am very partial to dogs   ramit sethi   i am not surprised   tim ferriss   you might recall   well, i have had a number of tweets and facebook posts   particularly if i have had a bit of wine and i am fully aware that i am somewhat intoxicated when i put these out  that is part of the fun  that kick up a big fuss and a friend of mine put it   i grew up with four cats  look, cats are fine  i just prefer dogs  and a friend of mine said, a dog is a pet  a cat is an animal that happens to live in your house  and i put out a tweet that was, if you are a cat were 70 pounds heavier it would kill you in your sleep and people did not respond very well to that   ramit sethi   you know what? i am going to echo what you said about americans loving their animals because i used to do this segment on abc and i had done it so many times that at a certain point, i had a good banter going on with the anchors and this  and i just started telling jokes  like, how many jokes can i tell before they  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    kick me off this? okay, and i started making some seriously   they were tasteful, but they were pushing the limit  the only time ever that i received hate male for anything i said on that channel was one day i made a joke about pets  i come home and like you said, you wake up and there is like   you have a pr crisis  i open up my email and i am like oh my god and i forgot americans love pets  i learned let me just keep my mouth shut in the media, except when i am speaking on your podcast to like four million people  that is great  great job ramit  tim ferriss   so, if you   let me rephrase this  so, if you went to, let us just say china   i have eaten dog before  i had to try it  i was there  it was not delicious  i had horse as well  it is a sweeter meat for a host of reasons  but, if you had to eat a particular species of dog and you could choose on the menu, what would you choose?  ramit sethi   i do not even know more than one species  i only know like golden retriever  but, if the question would i eat dog? when in rome, you know i will always try something once  as for what species, i do not even know   if you put a dog in front of me, i would be like   and you put like a german shepard, i would be like what a nice golden retriever   tim ferriss   you are such a bull shit artist  you just called it a german shepard  anyway  what has become more important to you as you have gotten older or less important? let us just say in the last five years   ramit sethi   wow, more important is surrounding myself with beauty  that is something that i actually made it one of my resolutions this year and i think i am a pretty kind of like unsymbolic or direct guy  i was the kind of guy when i grew up, i did not have any posters on my wall and when i had a cubicle i did not decorate it or anything  i started to see the people   like artists, especially that inspire me and they are all about inspiration and beauty  and it could be beauty in the type of dishes they use or it could be in the their apparent or whatever it might and i got inspired by that  that has become much more important to me  to be able to surround myself with beauty, with organization  it has changed my mind a lot   tim ferriss   how has that helped you? how has that improved your life?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    ramit sethi   it helps me look for subtle nuances that i did not see before  so, i walked into my   an old apartment and it had no posters on the wall, no painting, everything was just white and everything was very utilitarian  and i thought of myself like that  early on i was one of those guys that said, they should recognize me for me, not because of some clothes i wear  but, i came to discover that first impressions are important  what are you wearing? how are you standing? what is your posture and your smile? and also, when i see something beautiful, whether it is interior design or a dish at a restaurant, now i can appreciate the beauty and the work that went into that and the craftsmanship  so, looking at jiro dreams of sushi for example, it just looks like a simple piece of sushi, but the amount of work that went into it is actually decades and decades of work  and so i would say with a little bit of time i have just come to appreciate that beauty more   tim ferriss   what is the gaudiest thing that you have in your house? in retrospect where you are like, wow i was trying to figure out this beauty thing and god damn i got it wrong with that   ramit sethi   no, no, no  i will tell you the gaudiest thing that i love  how about that?  tim ferriss   alright  yes, let us go there   ramit sethi   okay, alright so the one thing that i wanted when i moved to new york was home cooked meals and i do not cook and i used to have all these excuses  then i started working from home and my mom is like you need to cook  and i said,  look, mom i am not going to cook   her response,  you need a wife   i was like,  mom, do not say that out loud  that is pretty sexist  okay?  she goes,  whatever   so, she does not care  so, i have a chef, which is for me that is one of the fortunate things that i have been able to do   tim ferriss   is that code for your wife?  ramit sethi   nope, i do not    tim ferriss   i am just kidding   ramit sethi   that would get me into real trouble here  no, it is not a wife  it is a  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    chef  so, that is probably the gaudiest thing that i would say  tim ferriss   do you mean   gaudy   do you make your chef dress like the swedish chef or like wear like iron chef gold?  ramit sethi   yeah, yeah i told this chef to dress up in a skimpy    tim ferriss   oh, boy here we go   ramit sethi   and the only problem is that it is a man, so it did not work out that well   tim ferriss   it is like a 50 year old ukrainian guy   ramit sethi   yeah, yeah he   the chef does not come in to my apartment  he just delivers it   tim ferriss   what is the best  100 00 that you spent in the last year? bang for the buck of stuff where you are like, god i cannot believe it took me that long to do that   ramit sethi   oh, okay  alright, so in the last year a second power cord  that was ultimate no brainer  i cannot believe how resistant i was to doing that because it was just wasteful in my mind  so, that has been amazing  back when i was first starting off, the best  100 00 that i ever spent was always taking people out to coffee, always  emailing a lot of people   in fact, that is how you and i met  you emailed me and we went out to coffee and turned into a very long friendship  that was a thing and i cannot encourage that enough, to just take people out to coffee  it is the best investment you can make   tim ferriss   what was your pitch because you and i have both commiserated about the lack of focus in most requests that we get via email  and i was like, hey i know you are really busy, but would you like to come out to a few hours of coffee where i can pick your brain and then maybe you can be my free full time mentor for the rest of my life? that type of undirected email very seldom gets a response  so, what were the emails that you sent   or in retrospect, what is a good way to have coffee with people and what type of folks should you actually aim for?  ramit sethi   great, great questions and both of us had to go through the fire to learn this  i think that if you are trying to meet president obama, it  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    is not going to happen  if you are trying to meet some nfl start, it is probably not going to happen  if you are trying to meet someone that profiled a couple of months in fast company or an author a blogger that you admire, that is imminently achievable  what it takes is being direct and making it clear what you want  the classic mistakes people have is they start saying, hi i will make this short and then like 18 pages later they end their email  it is like, so yes okay i guess i went too long  bye  i am like, delete  or they are very transaction  like, ramit i will buy you lunch and i would love to get your advice about a, b, c, d, e, f, g  and i am like, i could buy my own lunch dude and also, i have written about this for the last ten years  so, one of the things i think the best people do is they introduce themselves, they find some kind of commonality and then they make it clear what they are asking for  so, it might go something like this, hi tim, my name is ramit sethi  i am a student  i just graduated from nyu  i have been following you for the last six years and the best thing you ever wrote that made a huge difference in my life was the article on gong geek to freak  here is my before and after photo and i did that all because i followed your protocol  i am going to be in town for six days  i am looking to decide between x and y jobs  i know you worked at x  i would love to get your feedback and if you have the time, i will come to you wherever you are, even if it is for ten minutes or skype or phone  whatever you prefer  but, i can promise you that i am going to take your advice and i will follow up with you to let you know what i decided  you have a chance with an email like that  i even actually wrote an ebook about this  about my 50 best email scripts  50provenemailscripts com and that was because i had seen so many bad emails, but also so many great ones  i think the ability to write a great email and connect with someone is a huge differentiator  tim ferriss   definitely, i would add two things to that  the first is i genuinely feel that you will get a higher response rate from people if you do two things  the first is do not go after people who are currently in the limelight  if people are currently doing a lot of media, you are going to be one of many people trying to get their time and your chances go down  so, find someone who was in the limelight maybe years ago, who is still very good at what they do   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and maybe it is not a public figure at all  do not aim for michael phelps if you are trying to improve your swimming  maybe you should find someone who is like a bronze medalist tow olympics ago  guess what? they are still very, very good and a hell of a lot better than you  so, do not necessarily aim for the very top  your response rate will improve  secondly is give people an easy out  i paradoxically just find that the responses are better because there are still people who are a hell of a lot harder to reach than i am  so, i have a friend who knows arnold schwarzenegger  i would like to interview arnold schwarzenegger on the podcast  i believe he has actually listed to a few of the episodes, but he is in a hell of a lot more demand than i am and i were hypothetically   i have not reached out to him directly yet, but if i were to email him  i would not say, thank you for your favorable response   i look forward to your favorable response, tim ferriss  that shit drives people nuts  do not assume anything, other than they are busier, more important, more successful than you are, so you have to kind of have your hat in had a little bit  and a better way to end it would be, i understand you have tremendous demands on your time and if you do not have time to respond no problem  but, if you do, even a sentence would mean a lot to me  that is more likely to get a response because you are demonstrating a degree of empathy and you understand that their inbox is more of a warzone that your inbox  ramit sethi   let us dig into this for just a second  so, when i used to email seth godin   this is years and years ago  sometime i would write this beautiful email and he would write me back one line and i would kind of be like, that is pretty rude  in retrospect, knowing what   i get over 1,500 emails a day  knowing that he even sent me a response, i am actually humbled by how he did because i get lots of emails that i do not reply to  so, tim, what you were just talking about is know the power dynamic  when you are emailing someone busier than you, you better meet them where they are  you better work around their schedule  if someone emails me and they are like, i can meet at this time or that time  i am like, what? so, you have to know your power dynamic  the other thing is, we call this the close the loop technique  once you meet with someone, so many people just disappear forever  if someone took the time to meet you, they actually want   they are invested in your success  so, one thing i  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    encourage my students to do is follow up with them two weeks later  hey, you told me this  i dug in  i discovered you were right and so i took your advice and i just wanted to thank you  i will keep you updated a couple of months from now on how the new job is going  that is how you build a real relationship  tim ferriss   so, let me add to that because you and i both love the wordsmithing and testing of things like this  so, the first few years out of college, my entire job was to cold call and cold email ceos and ctos to try to sell multimillion dollar storage area network system and i had to test a lot of different approached  and i was nobody  i was as low as you come on the totem pole  i had a desk in the fire exit  i could not even back out of my desk  i had to like do this weird like half ass cheek role to get out of my desk  it was as low as you get  and i think that a very good response after you have met with someone   or a common mistake is they would be like, hey great to meet up  cool  here are my seven follow up questions  or like, i really enjoyed coffee  would love to take you out to dinner so i could have my three friends join and they would really benefit from blah, blah  do not follow up with an immediate additional request  follow up, like you said, with   and ideally give it a day or two  respond and say, thank you so much for the time  here is what i did  it had this result  it really means a lot to me  hope all   good luck with the project that you mentioned  all the best  and then do not hump their leg for a while  give it a little of gestation and the other thing that i would say is do not keep in touch just to keep in touch  these people are too busy for that and feel free to disagree with me, ramit, but do not just become a pen pal because you think it is necessary for them to not to forget you  that is going to, in my experience, repel people because you are crowding their inbox with zero substance email  if i have a good experience with you, i will remember you and worst case scenario, if you ping me two years later  the first thing i am going to do, guess what, is take your name and your email and search my inbox to see what previous communication  if you were a dick who followed up 12 times after i told i was on sick and on deadline and could not respond, i am not even going to respond to you  or i am going to tell my assistant to decline  on the other hand, if we had a good exchange, i will be like great and then i have done my due diligence, i have checked it out, and i  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    will respond to you  you do not need to follow up just to keep in touch  and a great example of that is jack canfield, co creator of chicken soup for the soul  i invited him   i volunteered at a group called silicon valley association of startup entrepreneurs  it is a mouthful, svase  and organized an event, invited him as a speaker, developed a relationship with him that way just by helping to organize and inviting media and so on  and over the years   this was starting in  99, 2000  over the years every once in a while when i had a very legitimate   and i do mean once every few years, i would send him a philosophical question about a life decision  i would say, hi jack just as a reminder this is me  i know you are super busy  if you cannot respond, no problem  but, i am facing this one life decision  here it is  i am considering a or b  here is my thinking on it  if you have any input at all, it would really make a huge difference to me and i am a young guy just trying to figure out what my step is  and then he would respond  and again, very seth godin like  usually in a short way and i did not keep in touch, but i respected his opinion and knew that he was qualified to answer these type of life questions every once in a blue moon  and then many years later, he was the one who made the introduction to the   a brand new agent who turned out to be my book agent and still is my book agent, who was one of the few people who had the confidence to sell the four hour work week after it was turned down   whatever it was, 27 or 29 times  but, that was not because i stayed in touch for the sake of staying in touch  sorry, this is like a very sensitive subject for me because so many people feel like, a, keeping in touch is the right way  so, just crowding my inbox or anyone s inbox is the way to endear yourself to them  it is not  and then secondly, they think that if someone says no that you are going to   that you should ping them another 30 times and i think that you need to recognize when someone is saying no because your pitch is not right, when someone is saying no because the timing is not right, and i think it is very important to learn to discern those things  if you ping someone, like i have lyme disease right now and i am on massive antibiotics  i am hugely backlogged because i have ben   i took a week away from everything to focus on medical treatment and there are people who just do not hear that  they are like, oh i just need to be persistent  let me send the same eight copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    emails and i will give tim 12 hours to respond, even though his auto responder says that he is on a death bed  and i am going to follow up with like, hey i am just making sure you got my email 12 hours later  do not do that stuff  it is just sort of a fundamental playbook   anyway i should check out your email scripts because i really feel like ten to 12 points with best practices with this stuff from people who receive thousands and thousands of emails would be really, really helpful  for those people interested, i am not hiring anybody right now, but if you want to see how i hired someone who started off as one my readers, named charlie hone has done a lot of interesting things now  i wrote a post called   or he wrote a post actually called lessons learned   or 12 lessons learned marketing the four hour body, i think it is  if you search anything along those lines it will pop up  and i explain how he developed   how we developed a relationship and how he approached it  i think that is a pretty good model actually for getting the attention of busy people  ramit sethi   absolutely   tim ferriss   cool, good sir, you have been very generous with your time  i do not want to chew up your entire evening  let me ask one more question and   actually two more questions and then we will put it to bed  the first is following up on the question of books  you are taking 10 percent of future earning of a small group of decently smart folks, 30 years old or 25 does not really matter, and you have to give them a handful of books  you mentioned the age of propaganda, social animal  what other books would you give them before you bid them farewell and good luck?  ramit sethi   you are coming back to this one, are you not?  tim ferriss   i am   ramit sethi   okay, boy that is a good question  alright, so we talked about psychology, we talked about copywriting  there is a book   boy, you are putting me on the spot but i am going to tell you the book that is coming to mind for me right now   tim ferriss   sure   ramit sethi   and it is a book i wish i had written and it is called never eat alone  it is by keith ferrazzi  it is all about networking the right  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    way  meeting the right people and notice that the books that i recommended were not books on corporate strategy or monetization or traffic analytics or whatever  they are books about stuff that never changes  that is how people think, principles, how to help people first rather than ask them for something  and i think all those three books would be amazing over the long term  tim ferriss   do you have a favorite biography or favorite biographies?  ramit sethi   yes, i do  the favorite one i read   i have been reading it for i think it is probably 20 years now  i reread it every couple years   is the biography of lee iacocca   tim ferriss   really?  ramit sethi   yes, it is outstanding  one of the things i remember and there is so many, is he said when he would be listening to someone he would say, you know i do not want to get persuaded by the sweetness of their voice  so, he would always say write it down  and there are a lot of people as you grow your business or grow in your career, there is a lot of people who are really verbally persuasive  and the principle there   the point of that is you do not want to be seduced by something in the moment, whether it is buying a house because of how beautiful the weather is or whatever  you want to see it as objectively as possible  so, put it on paper  take a minute  most things do not need to be rushed  there is one other biography, what they don t teach you at harvard business school  that sounds like a really gimmicky book, but it taught me so many amazing things about business by mark mccormick and i cannot recommend it enough   tim ferriss   brilliant  well, in closing, this is the last question  where can people learn more about the incredible ramit sethi and any parting advice for the listeners?  ramit sethi   they can find out   set up a special url actually for people who are listening, so it is iwillteachyoutoberich com tim  again, it is iwillteachyoutoberich com tim and put together some cool stuff to give away for people  and parting words are just   look, it is a thrill to talk to your audience  i have been   i have written a couple of things for your site  i think you have some of the most engaged, amazing readers and listeners on the planet  so, it is my pleasure to help as much as i can   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   thanks buddy  well, it is always fun to hang out  hopefully, we will be able to share some wine in the not too distant future and the next time you come out to sf give me a ring  i found a fantastic russian bath so we can continue our longstanding bromance and i appreciate you making the time, man  thank you very much   ramit sethi   you got it   tim ferriss   alright, buddy  i will talk to you soon  bye   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    "
158,166,Ramit Sethi — How Creatives Should Negotiate (#166),"'and this episode is actually a workshop  you are going to listen in on lessons in negotiating  not just that, but you will learn about positioning  you will learn about smart negotiation versus dumb negotiation  and of all of the resources out there on how to negotiate, 99 percent of them are piss poor  overcoming mental barriers related to entrepreneurship, what you should charge or how you should think about charging for your services, and then mock interviews  and the teacher is ramit sethi ''these lessons are all taken from a class that ramit taught  it was a multi day course on creativelive com, which is one of the fastest growing startups that i advice, where you can find some of the highest depth, highest quality, and widest breadth in terms of topic instructional videos anywhere on the web  you will be very impressed, and there is something for everybody  so you should check it out at creativelive com ''and ramit is not your man if you re looking for political correctness, but he is one of the best negotiators that i know  and he is hilarious  one of the quotes from my first long interview that i did with him, which detailed how he turned his blog into a multimillion dollar business, is,  indian people don t get punched, dude  we don t get into fights  we re busy doing spelling bees  ''he is a man who loves to speak truth, even when it s uncomfortable, especially when it s constructive  he s willing to take heat for it  and it is, all in all, very entertaining  i was considering calling this episode how to negotiate like an indian, because that s what he would call it and does call it, but it could also be considered negotiating for creatives  and this is particularly true, even though i pulled a lot from this audio for myself, where i am in life  so there are things you can use no matter what stage of your career you happen to find yourself in ''but if you are an entrepreneur, perhaps just getting into entrepreneurship, thinking of taking the dive into entrepreneurship, or you just want to get out of a trap of your won making, i think you ll find a lot here, especially as it relates to language smithing  pay a lot of attention to the word smithing and exact scripting that ramit uses  and if a particular section isn t clicking with you, just skip ahead 20 minutes or so, and you ll find yourself in a new lesson ''a couple of resources that i want to recommend before we get started because they helped me quite a lot are related to deal making and negotiating  and they re primarily books, but one article  so first article is  1000 true fans  by kevin kelly  if you re gonna read only one article on marketing, that is it  then books, the 22 immutable laws of marketing  the original edition talks about imported lite beer on airlines and whatnot  not the version for the internet  blue ocean strategy  and both of those books really talk about creating a category of one, which just increases your leverage and negotiating ability ''then two on the tactics and strategies of actual deal crafting and overcoming objections  getting past no, which is the real life, i would say, counterpart to getting to yes, and secrets of power negotiation  it is by dawson, d a w s o n, who cut his teeth in real estate  and i would suggest getting the audio if you can ''and the last resource, and all these things can be found in the show notes at fourhourworkweek com podcast  and you can find the original two hour conversation with ramit at fourhourworkweek com ramit  but the last is an ebook, and that was my dog smacking her head on the table  but never mind that  the last is an ebook called breaking the time barrier  this was actually authored by the fresh books team years ago  i did an interview with the ceo before this came out, and it was very, very well done  and you can find it online  i linked to that  this was well before they ended up doing anything with the podcast ''but for those who have asked how can i implement the principles in the four hour work week if i have a service business, or i m in a service industry? breaking the time barrier answers a lot of those questions, so i encourage you guys to check it out  and there are a few things in these lessons that are not relevant anymore, such as, i believe, the negotiated app, and occasionally, ramit will say tomorrow or the day after, we ll talk about a, b, or c  don t worry about that stuff  i had to pick and choose from about 20 lessons to get to an hour and a half, so there are three or four lessons in here  take what you can  ignore what you can t  and if you re bruce lee, you would add what is uniquely your own ''you can find ramit at ramitsethi com, r a m i t s e t h i  com, and you can say hello to him and risk being ridiculed if you want to poke the tiger by pinging him on twitter at  r a m i t  and without further ado, please enjoy these lessons and conversations and idea teardowns with ramit sethi ''ramit sethi  we re gonna talk about, oh, optimizing your spending  who here believes that you could actually cut certain areas of your spending? not by depriving yourself, but perhaps by getting a better rate, or negotiating some of those rates? anybody?''okay, we re gonna do a little exercise where people are actually gonna negotiate  maybe the people on the web  they can negotiate some of this stuff  i m gonna teach you the exact words to negotiate with some of the companies you do business with  and we ll ask some of the people on the web to negotiate, and maybe they can come back with their results  it actually doesn t take that long ''all right, so i d like to first introduce a concept called negotiating like an indian  okay, so basically i was raised since i was like four years old to negotiate  my mom used to take me to macy s and teach me how to negotiate with the clerks  she s like, don t talk to her  she s too experienced  go talk to her  she doesn t know what she s doing  and i would learn how to negotiate all this stuff ''and buying a car, for most people who were born here, it s like you walk in there, you buy it  for us, it s like a five day event  we eat breakfast at the car dealership and we d go home  i m not kidding  we would do this for four or five days  it was ridiculous  but that s just how we did it as a family  so indian people know how to negotiate very, very well  and i wanted to teach some of this to people here because it s not natural, right?''first of all, most of us are afraid of using the phone, which is so weird  i don t understand that  but we re taught negotiating is haggling, and it s unsavory, and what if they say no? and all this stuff  anyone here have somewhat of a fear of negotiating? yeah  and it could be negotiating our salaries  it could be negotiating with clients  it could be negotiating with some faceless person at a credit card company ''but it turns out that let s say   i m just gonna make up a numbers  let s say you re spending 100 bucks a month on cable or whatever, okay? with one phone call, if you could negotiate 20 bucks a month off that, that s over  200 a year in savings, right? for doing nothing  for one phone call ''the reason i call this a big win is that you keep on locking in those savings for years and years  you do the action once, you get the results for years and years  kind of like when you raise your rates with a client  you raise it once, you get the benefits for years and years  does that make sense? so that s a big win because you don t have to keep doing the work and using willpower  you just do it once, boom  you get the results ''so we re gonna talk about who we can negotiate against  and i ll give you a list of companies right now, because it s awesome  in fact, i was talking backstage to one of the crew, and he told me he just read my book starting on saturday, and he actually negotiated his apr with his credit card company  in other words, the interest rate he s paying for his credit card debt  did anybody know you could do that?''if you have debt, let s say you have five or  10,000  you can  it doesn t always work, but it works sometimes  you can actually negotiate that rate down  i have people who have negotiated something like 18 percent down to eight percent  many people are saving 100 plus dollars a month, many hundreds, if you have a high amount, on just negotiating ''so let s talk about the thing we can negotiate, and then we re gonna talk about how we can use that for our lives  credit card  you can negotiate for late fees, easy  easy  apr, you can do  it s a little harder  cable  anybody ever try to negotiate with your cable company? we re gonna try that in a few minutes  gyms, that s pretty hard, but you can do that  cell phone companies  anybody ever try to negotiate with your cell phone company?''female speaker 1  i just did it yesterday ''ramit sethi  did it work?''female speaker 1  yeah ''ramit sethi  how? how well?''female speaker 1  from  106 a month down to  79 a month ''ramit sethi  beautiful   500 a year ''female speaker 1  one hour and 33 minute phone call because the timer was on ''ramit sethi  wow, very good ''female speaker 1  and it was stressful ''ramit sethi  that s beautiful   500 a year in savings  and next year, it ll be even more, right? and that s very impressive for one phone call ''female speaker 1  seriously?''ramit sethi  yeah  run the math ''female speaker 1  wow  my brain ''ramit sethi  so that s very good  and that s the kind of stuff we can do  so i m gonna show you an actual script for how we can negotiate with some of these folks  and this is something that everybody can do today  all right? you can use this word for word script today and negotiate, all right? and i have a whole bunch more scripts ''let me show you this  so here s a script  okay, here s what s going on in this  i m gonna read it off, then i m gonna analyze it for you ''hi, my name s ramit sethi  i ve been a customer with your company for four years  i ve been doing some research, and i came across some other companies that can offer me a better deal than what you re giving me now  the thing is, i ve been a loyal customer for the past four years, and i d hate to have to switch to another company just because of a simple money issue  but you know, times are tough  so what can you do for me?''okay  you could break that up, you could break it into three or four paragraphs if you want  but let me analyze what s going on here  this isn t just some script i wrote in my bedroom and then put it on this screen  this script has been tested with tens of thousands of people, okay? it s been tested with cable companies, credit card companies, all kinds of companies, all right? and i have well over hundreds of thousands of dollars in savings for my students using this stuff  it works  does it always work? no  can it probably work for you with one of the companies you re paying? yes  yvonne, you re a great example   500 a year  so let me analyze what s going on here ''i love this phrase,  times are tough,  right? it doesn t really mean anything, but it s actually very true  times are tough  okay, that s your reason for calling up and negotiating  so if you feel guilty about calling up a company, the truth is, times are tough  you call them up and you say, look, times are tough ''i also like to focus on how many years i ve been with the company  do you know why? do you know how much it costs for a bank to acquire you as a customer? anyone have any idea? a lot  hundreds of dollars, sometimes over  1000 00  that includes everything from billboard ads, technology, the clerk, etc  you have to count all that  so do they want to lose you for a  27 late fee? no  they want to keep you for years  so that s why i specifically put in this and tested it how many years i ve been with the company ''also, hopefully you can do a little homework and you can find out another company is offering you a better deal  let s say you re on company x for cable, and you learn that company y is offering a special introductory rate  this happens all the time  you call up the cable company and you say, you know, i ve noticed that this cable company s offering, in your case,  110? they re offering  75  well, what are they gonna do? we re actually gonna do a role play right now ''so i want to take one person who wants to negotiate with me  you can pick what kind of company you are  i m your credit card company, i m your cable company, whatever, and we re gonna do a little mock negotiation right now  who wants to do it i m actually nicer than i seem ''female speaker 1  can i do a gym negotiation specifically?''ramit sethi  gym ''female speaker 1  because those people are tough ''ramit sethi  gym is tough  we can do a gym in a minute  that s a very tough one  who else has got something else? who wants to negotiate?''male speaker 1  oh, come on, stand up ''ramit sethi  they re too intimidated  you can keep sitting in your chairs  otherwise i m just gonna pick someone  i ll just cold call ''female speaker 1  i ll do it ''ramit sethi  okay, yvonne, our champion  all right, so yvonne, who am i? am i your credit card company, your cable company?''female speaker 1  credit card ''ramit sethi  okay  how about i just issued you a late fee for paying late, okay?''female speaker 1  okay ''ramit sethi  and the late fee was  35, okay? so hello, welcome to abc credit card company  how can i help you?''female speaker 1  hi, my name s yvonne  my account number should be there for you  i ve been a loyal customer for the last nine years, and i paid my statement online, but it seems to have registered the following day, and i see on my latest invoice that there s a  35 late fee  i m not really pleased with that, and i d like to see where we can get   yeah, i m not satisfied ''ramit sethi  okay  let me take a look at your account, dadada  yeah, i do see that late fee  unfortunately, it was received past our grace period, and so unfortunately, we will have to keep that late fee on your account  i really apologize for that ''female speaker 1  sorry, i appreciate that you re trying, you re at least listening to me, but i did make my payment, and there must be some leniency for someone   excuse me   who s been with the company as long as i have  and if you look at my track record, i always pay on time  i think that there should be some extra grace in this case  i d really appreciate more effort on your part ''ramit sethi  okay  okay, i m able to waive that fee  thank you very much for being a customer  we appreciate you ''female speaker 1  thank you ''ramit sethi  you actually did a great job  and i want to point out   yeah, let s give a round of applause for that  i want to point out what you did that was so great  and then i ll give you a couple constructive things i might change  but honestly, it was great  i love that you didn t end your questions with a yes or no question  that s a critical mistake people make  they ll say stuff like,  can you do anything for me?  what s the most common response someone gives you?''female speaker 1  no ''ramit sethi  no  well, why would i want to do more work for myself and have to explain it to my supervisor? you said,  surely you could do something for me   and you also said,  i m really not satisfied   that is beautiful  you ended on a statement  i also love that you were not antagonistic  people think negotiation is about someone s gonna break down and cry  no  you were very polite, but you were firm, right? anybody else notice that? it wasn t heated  we were just calm ''i also threw in a little no, and then you came back at me  and you said,  well, i understand that, but blablabla   so a lot of times, we don t prepare, and we kind of get shot down  then we re like, uh, okay, bye  and we re just like, oh, man  so you came back at me politely  you did a great job ''i might suggest a little tweak, which is, i like to start it off with a little rapport, a little friendliness, right? so you jumped right into it  i was like, damn, she s here to play  but instead, you can say something like, hi, i really appreciate you taking the time to chat with me  first of all, before we get into it, i just wanted to confirm how long i ve been a customer with you  i have eight years on my end  do you show the same? and they re gonna be like,  yes, i actually show the same  ''so basically, i m building rapport  hello, how you doing? but i m also laying the foundation for me about to say, hey, i ve been with you for eight years, as we both stipulated  just kind of making it a little friendly  it s also possible that sometimes this company will just say no  and that s the case  if so, you can say thank you very much  you can call back another time, all right? so there are ways to do it ''i m gonna even show you this new iphone app i have where i can show you exactly how to do it  but that s a script  it s very simple  it s not complicated  but there are some key psychological triggers going on in here, right? times are tough, there s a competitor that s offering a better rate, and i ve been with you for x years ''all right  let s keep going  let s pause there, actually, for a second  any questions about negotiation? i mean, there s so many ways   this is an area where you can instantly save hundreds of dollars a year, and it s a big win because you lock it in once, you get the savings forever  sarah ''sarah  are there any situations where you would say, don t negotiate? one of the things that you came out with, i guess a couple months ago, was negotiating your rent  i m living somewhere where rent is cheap cheap  and i worry that if i were to negotiate that my landlord would actually raise the rent  he would be like, oh yeah, you guys are living out there  actually i ve been meaning to update it ''ramit sethi  yeah, like he forgot about you ''sarah  yeah ''ramit sethi  so i do have a mini course on how to negotiate your rent  and rent is actually very   it s possible to negotiate  it s a little tough  but it s one of the biggest wins you can get, right?''sarah  right ''ramit sethi  a lot of my students, they negotiate a couple hundred bucks off their rent, which is a lot of money  and that s 200 bucks a month they re saving for as long as they live there ''in your case, one of the things i advise is negotiating your rent isn t for everyone  you want to first do a little homework, and i show you how to do that in the course, which is about let me understand, am i way underpaying rent anyway? if so, maybe i should just shut up and be happy with it  and if i m getting gouged, or i m a really good tenant, and maybe i have a little bit of leeway, you can actually do that  so you know that you re underpaying  i probably wouldn t do anything with that ''sarah  is that a general rule of negotiation? what are your general rules for not negotiating things? if you see a situation, how do you evaluate it?''ramit sethi  great question  i negotiate when there s massive opportunity for savings, and i know that there s leeway in the price  so for example, if you re buying an  80,000 car  i m just using an example  there s a lot of leeway to be negotiated  if i m buying a hotdog on the side of the street in new york, i m probably not gonna negotiate ''sarah  right ''ramit sethi  i also use social norms  so do people negotiate at mcdonald s? i would love to, but i ve never been successful  i just haven t  so you ve got to use your common sense  but i would say that most people, particularly in america, undernegotiate  they chronically undernegotiate ''and the fact is, okay, look  the savings from what you can save for something, you might save 10 bucks a month  you might even get rejected  but this is two part  one, you can actually get big win savings because you lock it in forever  two, when you start negotiating, you start realizing, oh my god  a lot of things are negotiable  client rates, start dates when you start working with a client or a nine to five job  anything, right? as long as you can bring value and you can communicate value to them ''so negotiation for me is two part  no  1, the direct savings  no  2, the indirect benefit i get from knowing that a lot of things are negotiable  okay? yes, drew ''drew  my question is, in your script, you had  i ve done some research and i found company y offers this rate   what would you do if you were trying to negotiate a price, but you ve done all your research, and you ve found there aren t any lower prices, and you still want to negotiate?''ramit sethi  yeah  first of all, i wouldn t lie  i just wouldn t bring that up  i would just say, look, times are tough  i just can t afford this  i d hate to have to cancel, right? and see how that works  if they say no, you say, what else can you do for me? what other introductory rates do you have going on?''a lot of times, cable companies   i m using a cable company as an example   they ll say, okay, there s nobody else offering a better deal  but we have an introductory rate going on for our new customers  i m happy to switch you there for six months or a year ''so right there, you re locking in 30, 40 bucks a month of savings as well  and that s not as big of a win because you re gonna get shunted back, but you can often ask them what else can you do, which is kind of exactly what you said to me, yvonne  instead of saying, can you help? no  what else can you do for me? and let them figure it out for you  okay? got questions from the web?''male speaker 1  oh, we definitely do  let s start out with inca, who is asking this from cypress  what if you do not have the advantage of being a long time customer, or you don t have perfect on time payment track? how do you defend your position?''ramit sethi  well, start making payments on time, first of all  there s a nice little automation system i know about  you need to be a good   you can t negotiate from a dramatic position of weakness  i mean, you could try, and i would say try, because what s the worst they re gonna do? say no? but if you are not a good customer, then frankly, why would i say yes, right? these companies want good customers  they don t want problematic customers  so i would say get your behavior in order in terms of making payments on time, etc , and maybe over time, maybe a year from now, you can go and negotiate  but probably no harm in trying ''female speaker 1  all right, this is a good question from brenda and rebecca kirfman  and rebecca s in nashville, tennessee  and i also want to know how do i handle it when my clients try these negotiating tactics on me?''ramit sethi  oh yes  oh, everyone s like, oh my god  so somebody asks, who should i not negotiate against? and i was gonna be like, me, because it will never work  people try to negotiate with me all the time  and actually, the people who work for me have used some of my own scripts against me  and i was like, damnit, here you go  you know what? because they actually added such massive value that it wasn t like i was being tricked  i wrote those scripts  but i realized, they convinced me that the value they added was there and was real and tangible, and so i actually awarded them at a raise ''this happened at another company i used to work at, and now at my own company  however, you will often find a lot of people who will try to negotiate you and kind of nickel and dime you  and i m gonna talk about how to handle that tomorrow  we re actually gonna do some hot seats, where i might be the nickel and dimer, and then you re gonna have to come back at me  so tomorrow s the day about turning your creativity into income, and we re gonna work on that  i m gonna teach you how to negotiate with clients, and what to do if they negotiate with you ''female speaker 1  that s perfect, because for a lot of people in here who have standard fees, say, as a photographer, and are asking what happens when people try to negotiate those professional fees with me? so that ll be great ''ramit sethi  yeah  and i ll just say one thing before we cover it tomorrow  you always want to think long term  so if you see someone who is a potentially amazing client, and they just really hate the setup fees or whatever fees, you might actually waive them  but say, normally i don t do this, but my goal is to work with you over the long term, and i like what you re doing  and i see that there are potentially 12 projects going forward  if i do an extraordinary job, the next engagements, they will have to include this  that s just the way i work  but i m willing because i want to invest in our relationship to start off here, and i m willing to waive that fee if that works for you ''who s gonna say no to that? plus, what have you just done there? you just locked in potentially 12 new engagements  so a lot of people, they get too fickle and focused on the near term money, like don t take away my  199 setup fee  but really, stop thinking about the  80,000 they can make for later  we ll talk about that tomorrow ''male speaker 1  kimbya patrice is wondering if you find that there are gender differences in negotiation ''ramit sethi  women chronically undernegotiate  they use certain words that cost them far more  i discovered this in my own research  it s also validated in the literature as well  they say things like,  i think  or  maybe   they ll end their tone with an upturned question mark  anyone here do that?''female speaker 1  yeah, so when i negotiated my salary, with a lot of your techniques, actually, at my most recent position, i was able to negotiate to almost double the initial offer ''ramit sethi  can we get that on camera? whoa ''female speaker 1  but a friend of mine who thinks that he would get along really well with you, and i probably agree, i sent him my email and said, what do you think of this as far as negotiating? and he totally tore it apart  and i had a lot of this, with the yes or no questions, saying can we try x amount? and they would have said no  whereas he said, let s try this going forward, and we can sort of talk about it  and so that, i think, was really valuable ''ramit sethi  very good  first of all, i appreciate you implementing some of the stuff i talk about  it s easy for us to all be here and kind of nod our heads and be like, yeah, i m gonna negotiate, and then not do anything  but i really appreciate that you did it  and you almost doubled your salary  i m so happy for you ''the gender differences in negotiation are real, okay? and we kind of intuitively know this, but in some ways, it s not politically correct to talk about differences between men and women  but i don t believe that  i believe that we are different, and we each have our strengths and weaknesses  and i know from my own research doing my research for my course, how to find your dream job, that the women who came in for testing   we brought them into the studio   they were just at a very different level in terms of negotiation  and they had these chronic tells  an upturned tone saying,  i think i might do this,  which is very common  and as a hiring manager, i looked at them and i m like, cool, that just saved me  5,000 00  that s just  5,000 00 more  and you don t want to be in that position ''the thing you said about can we do this? never  i m glad you actually went and talked to a friend who was strong at negotiating  so many of us never do this, right? we walk into a negotiation with a client or with a potential boss as if we just go into it for our first time, like a fresh doe  meanwhile, this boss has done this 5,000 times, so you re going up against a hardnosed negotiator  and you expect to beat this person without even practicing once? are you out of your mind?''i love that you actually went to a friend  and we re gonna cover negotiation in detail on day three  but your friend was right  simple changes in language can actually make you 5, 10,  20,000 00  i ll give you a script right now we re gonna talk about on friday  but i ll just give it to you right now  a lot of people, when you re going to apply for a job, they ll say, what are your salary requirements?''female speaker 1  oh, i actually know this, too  and i ve taught this to other friends who have killed it in there  i told you, i m a long time reader  so you say, i m happy to discuss finances a little bit further down the road  but right now, i m just trying to see if this position is a good fit for the both of us, or some variation thereof ''ramit sethi  that s exactly right  beautiful  now what you did with that, and we ll talk about this more   what you did with that was instead of succumbing to that question   many people believe that if someone asks a question, you have to answer it ''anybody ever watch a presidential debate? are you out of your mind? you ask a question  now these guys are the true, true masters at it  now they may answer the question maybe 30 percent of the time  but they have a message, and they will do anything to get that message out, okay?''so let me just give you an example  a top performer would never answer that  almost never  so if someone asks me, hey ramit, what was your last salary? i need to know for the salary requirements, i would say exactly that  i would say, you know what? i m happy to discuss money down the road, but right now, i m just trying to see if there s a good fit for both of us  i m sure you re trying to do the same thing  now what kind of person would say that?''female speaker 1  a baller ''ramit sethi  a baller  someone who knows, i have five other job offers going on right now  by the way, i know i m so good that i know the money s gonna come  in fact, the money s gonna come  let s just deal with that later  it s such a detail ''and you know what? to me, it is  and to a top performer, it is  but to a beginning or novice person, it s not  the first thing they want to do is, oh my god, well, i made  40 an hour at the last one, so i need to be making  43 an hour, right? they want to talk about it  and when you start talking like that, what do i know? as a hiring manager, a very experienced hiring manager, i m like, okay, gotcha  gotcha  because maybe i was prepared to pay  60 an hour  but you said  43  i m like, sweet  i just saved  17 bucks an hour  boom, right? so we make these mistakes way back here, never realizing that 80 percent of the work is done before we ever get into the negotiating room  let s keep moving on ''we ve talked about the differences between theory and practice  and i just want to take a second to highlight that we did a lot of stuff about negotiation  if you go to iwillteachyoutoberich com creativelive, i ve got a bunch of scripts for you, okay? and you re gonna feel pretty confident reading these scripts  everyone can read in their room  it s great  but actually doing it   sarah, how did it feel the first time you actually negotiated?''sarah  oh my god  i sent this email that said let s in it, and it was like four sentences long instead of this flowery   well, i think we can do well together  and i was terrified  they had already made the offer  i knew that they weren t going to say, nope, we ll hire someone else  the worst they could do was sort of laugh at my offer and give a counteroffer  but i was so nervous sending this email in ''ramit sethi  yeah, and it s interesting, you did it via email, something i don t normally recommend  but if it works, it works ''sarah  well, it was in a contract negotiation that they were sort of sending via email ''ramit sethi  ah, got it  but the point, even still, sending an email, you were terrified  negotiation is very scary  now it s easy to sit around and read these scripts and feel like, oh, i ve read the script  that s enough  wrong  everybody today can go and negotiate probably one thing  we could negotiate a service provider that we re paying, a credit card, cable, gym, whatever  these things will change the way you think about taking control of your money, okay? so that s what i mean when i say the difference between theory and practice ''all right  let s take a couple more questions if we have some more  i know we had a bunch in the chat room ''female speaker 1  we do always have so many questions for you ''male speaker 1  absolutely ''female speaker 1  go ahead ''male speaker 1  so claire of auray is wondering, my credit card got sold to another company in february  how long would you wait to negotiate with them? my credit report shows my history transferred over  and i think this generally, the question of when can you start negotiating with a company? how long do you need to wait to establish that relationship?''ramit sethi  just negotiate now  what s the worst they can say, no? call back in six months  yeah, don t wait  february to now is a long time  i say just get going  call them up  what else?''male speaker 1  i love it ''female speaker 1  let s see  a question from michelle totes photography in atlanta  how do you answer the salary question when you re just submitting a resume, say online, and it asks for your salary requirements?''ramit sethi  easy  n  a  okay? but what you re gonna learn on friday is that if you re already submitting your resume through the front door through a website, you ve probably already lost ''okay? that s a very  ''female speaker 1  good point ''ramit sethi  yeah, it s a very different way of thinking about resumes  most of us believe, if i just send out 50 more resumes, maybe i ll get a call back  wrong  you can sidetrack the entire game and find a totally different way of doing it, okay? what else?''female speaker 1  well, i just want to let you know that flares36 says, i just called my gym and i got them to lower my membership by  5 and give me access to all of their gym facilities within the states ''ramit sethi  beautiful  that s really awesome ''female speaker 1  real time action being taken all over the world ''ramit sethi  that, by the way, even the  5 a month is better than dreaming about a  50 a month reduction, right?  5 a month  okay, at least we got started  now i bet you this person s gonna call 10 other companies today  these companies don t like me very much, by the way  all right, what else? anything else?''male speaker 1  kier is wondering, can you negotiate insurance? a general question, what can t you negotiate?''ramit sethi  you can negotiate insurance  in fact, if you google ramit sethi car insurance, you will find an actual script to negotiate your car insurance  that s a big win because you re paying it year after year ''you basically call them up and you say, look, what kind of discounts do you have available for x, y, z? and insurance is such a massive difference in price, when i compared my insurance that i was paying   i don t know what i was paying  i m gonna make up a number here  let s just say it was  300 a month  insurance ranges from  99 a month to  900 a month  it s a vast range ''so you can use that script on my website to figure that out as well  by the way, as we continue with these questions, anyone reading who has used my negotiation techniques to negotiate lower rates or higher salaries or higher client rates? i want to hear from the web because we got an almost double your salary here  i know a bunch of people watching have used my techniques  so i want to hear from them as well ''male speaker 1  designdiva says, i m in canada, where cable and phone companies have a monopoly that makes them difficult to negotiate with  i agree with you that how much it costs for a company to acquire a customer, but it doesn t appear to have enough weight over here  any suggestions on what could be added to the script for that sort of situation?''ramit sethi  no, in some cases, you just can t do it  so move on  don t sort of belabor it  move on and just find something else, either to negotiate or how to earn more money or automate your money  yeah ''female speaker 1  so i want to go back to the gender thing because i find that really interesting  and i find that with many things in life, just acknowledging what those differences are, being aware of what you re doing, can lead you to make those changes, or just to be aware  so newgirl says, does a woman need to pretend that she is a man to negotiate, or is there a feminine negotiation style that is just as powerful and respected in the business?''ramit sethi  of course  great, great question  no, you don t have to pretend to be a man  not at all  some of the best negotiators i know are actually women  and they use their unique strengths  for example, women smile more  they re more personable  i m generalizing here, but i know   i ll give you an example of smiling ''remember how i told you i applied to 65 or 70 scholarships? so i wrote pretty good essays, but i started getting this interviews, and i would go on these interviews, and i was like, yeah, i m so good  and i kept losing every scholarship interview  it just didn t work  i just kept losing them, and i was like, what is going on? and i finally videotaped myself, and what did i learn? i learned that i wasn t smiling, right? at all  i just didn t smile that much  and once i changed that one tactic, everything changed for me  i started getting scholarship after scholarship ''the first thing i would suggest, and we ll cover this on friday, is videotaping yourself  you re gonna be very surprised at how you come off versus how you think you do  some women will smile too much  that s bad because you ll come off as a little flirty or giggly  that s not good  some won t smile at all, and as she pointed out, maybe with the idea of being more masculine, you can actually have a nice blend ''you can be yourself, but you also want to be really cognizant of certain phrase you use, like can we do x? and be careful about focusing on the things that are about negotiation rather than, can you do this? no  okay, bye  if i were to come to you and say, hey, i want you to shoot my wedding, or whatever, what would you say, if you re not a wedding photographer?''female speaker 1  i would say i don t have the lighting, and a second shooter ''ramit sethi  good, good  i don t have the equipment  very good ''female speaker 1  right ''ramit sethi  now forget the wedding example  what are other ways that you ve said, i m not an expert to someone ''female speaker 1  i m not as good as somebody ''ramit sethi  very good  i m not as good as x  good  drew, what do you got?''drew  i don t usually do this, i don t usually shoot weddings, but i ll do it  aka, i m not gonna be the best, but i ll still do it ''ramit sethi  okay, i actually like that  that s a nice way of overcoming that mental barrier  i m not usually x, but i m gonna do it  we ll talk about that  that s very good  what else?''female speaker 1  how does that fit in with  inaudible  though?''ramit sethi  we ll talk about that later  yeah  i know you want to jump ahead  you re the advanced student  okay, what else?''female speaker 2  i don t know enough about how to do that ''ramit sethi  yeah  how about, i d like to do that, but i need a couple more years before i get there  right? interesting  so what else? i mean, clearly there are other phrases we say  everyone just nodded at that  everybody chimed up  what else?''female speaker 1  i don t have enough experience ''ramit sethi  uh huh  i m too young ''female speaker 1  too young  22 years old in a city with all of these sort of writers in their 30s and 40s ''ramit sethi  they re not gonna take you seriously ''female speaker 1  yeah ''ramit sethi  uh huh  see, the language is so important  if i sit here and just give these slides, and say i m not an expert, people are like, okay, that sounds fine  check the box, move on  but when we talk and the actual words we use, everybody s nodding their head  did you notice that? did you notice how when i put this slide up, everyone was like, uhh, and then when i said i don t have enough experience, or i m only 22, everyone was like, oh my god? what do we have on the web?''male speaker 1  ryan is saying, i m still learning ''ramit sethi  mm, really good  okay, what else?''female speaker 1  tagstreak jet says, i m afraid that by doing something i love, it will turn into just another job ''ramit sethi  that s good  that s not i m not an expert, but that s definitely a mental barrier  what else?''male speaker 1  susan is saying, i can t guarantee that i will be as good as somebody else ''ramit sethi  i can t guarantee  what can you guarantee? okay, very good ''male speaker 1  emtree hollis says, i ve never been paid to do this before ''ramit sethi  ah, i love it  okay ''female speaker 1  good one ''ramit sethi  these are so good because we re getting way beneath the surface of the strategy or the mental barrier, and we re actually understanding, what are the words we say? again, i m doing this because i want you to understand the importance of language, right?''you could go to a client and you could say, i m easy, fast, and secure  and what would they say? get out of my office  i don t even know what you re talking about  however, if you say, listen, i understand that i have my own three kids, and i know how difficult it is to take photos of them, because they don t want to smile  sometimes they re irritable  last week, i took a photo of someone who was vomiting all over the store  but i actually have developed my own way of reaching out to these kids, specifically kids between the age of two and four  and let me show you some photos i ve taken  this little boy was crying for two hours  then i did x, y, z  look at the photos we got ''oh my god  that mom just started to cry  she feels every fear handled  see that? all right, let s keep moving on ''male speaker 1  by the way, if i could really quick, an interesting one  grub says, i have dreadlocks down to my butt and people don t take my appearance seriously  so that kind of is along that same lines of i don t look like people think an expert looks ''ramit sethi  yeah, very good, very good  i mean, that s actually true for me  when i started off, people were like, who s this guy talking about money who s 23 years old, back in the day  and they wanted me to change the name of my site because iwillteachyoutoberich, frankly, to a lot of people, sounds like a scam  and that s very true  i mean, how do you kind of get around that? we ll take about that  okay  oh, look at this  i d feel weird charging people for something i enjoy doing anyway  or in other words, if i were to charge for this, i worry that i would hate it  anybody here ever heard somebody say that, or maybe you said it yourself? it s super common ''female speaker 1  friends of yours  what do you mean, yvonne? you ve got a camera  why don t you just bring that along? why should we pay you?''ramit sethi  right, well, that s a whole other thing about freeloaders  we ll talk about that  i love freeloaders  actually, i love showing you how to deal with them  yeah, drew ''drew  i mean, i was just gonna say that that can be also an excuse for, i m not gonna charge you because if it s not good enough, then i m gonna look like an idiot, and nobody s ever gonna hire me again ''ramit sethi  very good, very good  lot of fear  creatives are struck and paralyzed by fear that they re not good enough, etc , etc  and ironically, they re simply focusing on this area, never understanding the game that s being played around them  the game of the client not even really understanding or caring about you being at this outer end of the concentric circle of being world class technically  they probably   i m not saying for everyone   but probably, they d be happy if you re here, good, not amazing, good, but you also understood their hopes, fears, and dreams, which we re gonna get into deeply ''lululemon could have understood my hopes, fears, and dreams, addressed it by putting up a sign that said men, and i would be a customer probably for a long time  but they didn t  a video crew could have understood my concerns by not even talking about cameras in front of me, because i don t know or care, and saying, ramit, i understand that you re on a tight timeline  one thing we can commit to in writing is that we will always turn around our videos in 24 hours  and if we don t, i want you to charge us  300 a day in late fees  boom  charge me anything you want, signed ''but instead, people want to focus on getting to the outer end of the concentric circle, as if that is going to make them incredible  anyone here know an absolutely amazing creative, world s best writer, world s best photographer, whatever, who can t make a dime? yeah, because they don t know any of this other stuff that we re talking about today  okay  i love this barrier because it s so weird  all these barriers are so weird, but yet so true  and what are we actually saying here? i feel weird charging  what we re saying is exactly what your online friend said, which is i m worried about succeeding because then i ll have all these problems ''for example, if i actually do all the things ramit is saying, i m gonna be way too busy, and i don t want that because i don t have enough time as it is  really? could you potentially raise your rates so you could actually make triple the revenue in a third of the time? yeah  you know what? it s a good problem to have  that s something every creative needs to remember  you want to have good problems  good problems are too many clients because you could raise your rates and cut those out  good problems to have are too many options, etc  so let s not preoccupy ourselves with things that might happen down the road which are gonna be good, all right? let s stay in the present and deal with it when it comes ''okay, next barrier  this is a big one  i hate selling myself  let s hear the words that people have used to describe this ''female speaker 1  i feel like a car salesman ''ramit sethi  yup  dawn, you look like you have one ''dawn  i  inaudible  we were talking about with people who have done this before  it just feels so dirty, dishonest  it s just gross ''ramit sethi  good, good  what else? talk to me about it  megan?''megan  i say that phrase  i say, i m no good at selling myself  i m not  and i ve had people actually offer me money, and i m like, no, i ll do it for free ''ramit sethi  yeah, very common, very good  all right, i like that  kathy?''kathy  this happens a lot, where people will be like, oh, i want this thing  and kind of similarly, i m like, oh, i just kind of freeze ''ramit sethi  um hum  anything from the web?''male speaker 1  we do  cguthrie is saying, i feel creepy ''ramit sethi  uh huh ''female speaker 1  and ryan says, i hate being sold to, so i don t want to do that to other people ''ramit sethi  good ''male speaker 1  wolfx3 is saying, i was brought up not to brag about myself ''ramit sethi  yeah, me too  that didn t work out so well ''female speaker 1  like selling out, right? we re creatives  inaudible  ''ramit sethi  totally, selling out  this is, again, one of the weird pathologies of creatives, which is you re selling out  and i want to tell you a story about this because i went through this myself, and it was actually very emotionally gut wrenching ''so on my site, iwillteachyoutoberich com, i started it when i was in college  and it was a free site  i never monetized it for years and years  i believe it was three or four years  my friends, a lot of them went to work at google  this is back in  04,  05  they were like, hey, put ads on your site  you could make a lot of money  and my thing was like, why? i don t want to do that  first of all, is it gonna make enough to cover my rent? if not, why do i care? second, i m gonna spend all my time worrying about these monetization things and all this stuff, and not even worry about what i m really good at, which is writing and changing peoples  behavior  so three years, i didn t monetize it at all ''i actually paid out of my own pocket, and i was fine with that because it wasn t designed to make money  it was just, i needed to get this out to the world  well, finally, i had a lot of readers  i had maybe 100,000 monthly readers at that point, or something  and i said, you know what? i m gonna try something  i m gonna create an ebook ''and i created an ebook  and it was maybe 30 pages  and i charged  4 95, which is so laughable because one of my most recent courses was  12,000, okay?  4 95, and i was petrified  in fact, if you want to read what being petrified looks like, google ramit sethi 2007 guide to kicking ass  that s what it was called, all right? i was a juvenile young man  and you can see it in that sales copy  i m afraid, i m nervous  i literally said, why am i charging for this? and i actually went on to explain it  like let me defend myself from you internet weirdoes ''and guess what happens? people were like, this site jumped the shark  oh, i see  iwillteachyoutoberich means i will teach me how to be rich  i could find this for free on google  all this crap  and it was like my worst fear coming true  but people were ordering  a thousand people ordered it  so i was like, what? all these chatterers who are telling me, you re sleazy for selling a  5 ebook after writing free stuff for three years  i felt so unappreciated  and yet, there were all these people buying it ''it was very emotionally taxing, to tell you  so there have been two big emotional taxing parts in my business  the first was, for the first year and a half of my business, it wasn t a blog  it was me teaching informal classes at stanford, and everybody said they would come, and then nobody came  and it was really tough to go through that  so i started the blog  the second emotionally taxing part was this  and it took me another two years to really get my head around selling ''if you look at my new material, right? anyone here from the web? let s just hear if anyone here is an earn 1k student, or a dream job student, or a no stress negotiation student  these courses are hundreds or even thousands of times what i charged for my ebook  and guess what? i feel way more comfortable charging for them  i never defend my price  i tell you, look, this is it  in fact, i don t want half of you to buy this  this course is like a  3000 course  i m like, you have credit card debt? you re not allowed to buy it  and the tenor and the dynamic has changed so much because i ve mentally gone along that road of being comfortable with selling ''by the way, my revenues are way higher, okay? and it s great  no more emotionally taxed ramit because i m not even dealing with those clients  you understand? i have been super clear about who i serve, super clear about who i don t  when we say things like, i hate selling myself, it s just like the person yesterday who said, ramit, this automation thing sounds great, but it sounds like you re gambling  and do you remember my response? my response was, that s coming from a place of fear  it s not that this person has rationally, calmly read three books and evaluated the differences in asset classes  they re just like, i don t understand this, so i m scared ''like here  for all the people that have said, i hate selling myself, selling is sleazy, slimy, scammy, i feel dirty, have they ever taken one class on sales? have they ever studied marketing? no  what we do is we immediately jump psychologically to the worst thing we can imagine  some dude with really sleazy slimy hair coming up to you at some party like, hey, here s my business card  we should talk  you should buy this  and we re like, i don t want to be that guy  but that s not real sales  that s not real marketing  again, my courses are quite expensive  and my students love to pay it ''when i do consulting, which i almost never do, i charge an extraordinary rate  they re happy to pay it because i was able to listen, connect, understand what value they wanted, and overdeliver  selling is almost the last thing i do  and that s what we re gonna learn today  so let s throw it to the web, and let s throw it to reactions from here as well, and see what people think about that ''female speaker 1  i feel like i m completely stuck in the first circle ''ramit sethi  yup ''female speaker 1  when you shifted from a point of selling an ebook for  4 95 to somewhere close to charging three grand an hour for consulting, did you feel like you had hit your external challenges? had you checked off those other circles? were you there?''ramit sethi  it took me years to get these checked off ''female speaker 1  but had you challenged yourself by learning the things that you didn t know yet before you transitioned to saying, i m this expensive?''ramit sethi  no  i went up a gradual path  we all go up  look, if you re charging  30 an hour, you re probably not gonna charge  300 an hour next month  you re going to go  30 00,  60 00  at each level, you re going to have to understand different types of clients, and you re gonna have to develop your skills ''the skills that i have at  3,000 00 an hour are very rare  that s why i can charge it  and i also deal with a very small amount of clients who can afford that, or who even see the value in it, right? but when i was back charging  20 00 an hour, that s a whole different client base  they want different things  they speak in different words, right? a  3,000 00 an hour  ''i ll tell you an example  i recently did a small consulting engagement  again, i do maybe one or two a year  the money s really not even that attractive to me  it s about making a big change  and frankly, i would make more money spending that time working on my own business, okay? which tells you what kind of business i ve built ''so i worked with this gentleman who s a pretty senior guy in new york  and the sales process was less than two minutes  he knew what i do  he knew what i kind of do on a day to day basis  he said, listen, would you be willing to come in and talk to my team about this? i said, sure, i d just charge you my normal day rate  he said, what is it? i told him  he said, you charge that much? i said, yeah  i have a very rare skillset, and for the right type of client, it makes a lot of sense to pay that  he goes like this  okay, send me an invoice by this afternoon  and that was that ''so that is what happens at a  3,000 00 an hour level  he s not debating me  what time are you gonna show up to my office? all that is assumed that that s gonna work  but for a  30 00 an hour client, you re gonna be having agreements in place  you would talk about what time are you gonna show up, how soon are you gonna deliver this, right? it s a whole different thing  at a different level, as you move up that value chain, you re just gonna assume that someone who charges that much is gonna get it down ''and by the way, i overdelivered to him, right? he said something to me  he said, listen, would you be willing to come in a second time if we need you in? which would have exceeded my hours  do you know what i said? what would a  30 00 an hour consultant say? no, we re gonna have to write that down in a contract  i m gonna have to bill you, bill you for my time, bill you for my taxi  what did i say? of course  because it s about building a long term relationship  let s not overfocus on the  3000 an hour thing  let s focus on what we do today and how we can grow our business  it s very different ''my point to you is at each level, as you move up, which you will   by the end of today, you should be able to increase your rates by 30 percent, easily  easily  you will experience different types of clients, different needs, different language, and you ll have to adapt  so when i charged  147 00 for a product, or whatever, that was different  when i charged  12,000 00, it was totally different, okay? all right  let s go to the web  what do we have? and we ll come back to you, kathy ''female speaker 1  i love what susan says  she says, it makes me think that if i m comfortable with my prices, i can be okay with them saying no thanks ''ramit sethi  so good  we re gonna talk about that today  yes  you re not gonna serve everybody  what else?''male speaker 1  along the same lines, peter v  says, just because i wouldn t pay that much for my own services doesn t mean someone else wouldn t  fear and regret  inaudible  ''ramit sethi  so good  what else? kathy, you had one?''kathy  yeah, so i noticed shifting from   i was in corporate sales, and i didn t give a shit  and i d be like, blablabla  so from moving from corporate to small business and something i really love, i had a lot of fear, and i still do have a lot of fear around   i care so much about this thing that i sometimes forget it s a business, and you re just building relationships versus selling ''ramit sethi  that s right  yeah, you re adding value  and we re gonna totally change the dynamic  again, a lot of us jump to the idea that i have to sell someone  i have to convince them of 800 reasons why they should use my services and not go to all these other cheaper photographers or writers  the truth is, if you re playing that game, you ve already lost  you have already lost ''what you are doing   if that s your problem, if you go in to clients   listen up carefully, everybody, especially online  if you re going into client meetings and you find yourself almost arguing, saying this is why i m worth it  this is what i do, look at me  yeah, you could go to those other guys, but this is what i do, you ve already lost because you ve already missed the entire game of what are you needs? of asking without selling, which i m gonna show you how to do  i m actually gonna do hot seats where i bring people up and we do that ''you ve already lost if you re sitting there debating price, okay? when i sell, i m like, listen  take it or leave it  this is what kind of value i can add to your life  here s all the people that have benefited  i understand your concerns  i understand them better than even you understand them  and they read it and they re just like, oh my god  this guy is like my mother  he knows me  and take it or leave it  and by the way, this thing is gonna close at a certain point  so we ll talk about that  you had one, megan ''megan  yeah  i think it s key, what you said about overdeliver, because when sue bryce was here, she kind of spoke to that  and she was saying she charges  3,300 00 for her portrait package  and somebody asked the question, well, would you ever charge more? because they were kind of wondering, could she make more money? and she was like, well, not until i feel like i can deliver a product that s worth more than  3,300 00  i mean, because she already felt like she was delivering all that she could  and she was overdelivering for the price that she was charging ''so she really drove that point home that you have to value the product that you re offering  you re not some hack that s trying to convince somebody, oh, i m good enough, i m good enough ''ramit sethi  yeah  so love that point  love it  overdelivering can be   what most creatives think is, i need to overdeliver by taking a higher resolution photo, or whatever the hell you say  writers think, i ll deliver an extra 10 words, or whatever  it s irrelevant  you should be delivering an amazing product  you need to be doing that, otherwise get out of the game ''but over delivering can be things like, you know what? i m gonna include a complimentary dvd for you to share  i m gonna include   i m gonna come back to you six months later and do a photo refresh for free  i m gonna come to your office instead of you having to come to mine because i know you re a busy executive and i understand your needs  that s overdelivering  and at that point, you can charge a lot ''your clients will love you because you actually understand what no one else does  everyone s sitting there saying, i ll give you five photos instead of two  i don t care  you re actually addressing my needs  so all of these things are about overdelivering  for my courses, my goal is to overdeliver at least 10x, sometimes 100x  i charge a very extraordinary rate, but i want to deliver much more than that as well  so that s absolutely key  okay  let s take a couple from the web, and we ll move on ''male speaker 1  so a couple of people have been saying that they get it, but they re just hardcore introverts and have a hard time talking to people ''ramit sethi  i have introverts  in fact, i m gonna do a case study right now  and then we have one introvert tomorrow who s gonna come on  this guy, he s amazing  he s not particularly the most socially skilled guy  he s even said that himself  and you re gonna see that you don t have to be mr  extroverted, mr  networky to do it  no  there are plenty of people who even work with me who are just   they re very quiet, and they don t get their energy from being around people, but they know how to ask the right questions and deliver value  some of them are more comfortable emailing me proposals  that s a way to get around that as well ''what i m gonna challenge you with is the person who said that, they re immediately jumping to all these conclusions  like i can t sell myself because i m not so fluent with words, and i get nervous, so i could never do it  wrong  a better way to think about that is, okay, one of the areas of weakness for me is i get a little nervous around people and it drains me  so what are my options? one, i can practice  how many of us actually do that? no  2, i can go around that problem by emailing people instead of going out to meet them  etc , etc , right?''so instead of making it a total weakness, let s turn it into how do i get around this? how much should you charge? huge questions on charging and raising rates and stuff like that  so my suggestion to people is really start out with an hourly rate, okay? this is controversial stuff, but this is what i ve found to work for my students  start off with an hourly rate ''i like to understand the scope of what my competition charges  so let s say i m a photographer, or let s say i m a writer, and my competitors, which i ve looked around at, they charge anywhere between  30 and  45 an hour  okay, let s just say  so i d probably try to charge right in there around  40 an hour  not the highest end of it, but pretty high  why? because i m going to be doing valuable work that s gonna be way more valuable than other people  other people are gonna be here in the laborious tactics of their craft  well, my craft is good and getting better, but i m also gonna be doing all these other things that my editor cares about, like being interesting, like driving page views, like blah, blah, blah ''so i don t want to charge at the highest, because if you charge at the highest part of your range, then people are gonna be like, hey, why? why are you charging so much? but over time, you will actually often be able to charge the highest and even higher, like dean, or like other folks who charge even astronomically high rates ''does that make sense? okay  you will have to deliver value  you will be able to raise your rates  but this is a basic framework for how much to charge, all right? and you can find how much people are charging online  you can just google that, okay? very simple ''we ll get back to some of the questions, but i want to work through these quickly  oh god  should you ever work for free? okay  creatives want to kill me right now already, and i haven t even said anything on this slide  because they throw around words like spec work is evil, oh my god  you re destroying and keeping the man down, blablabla ''you don t know what you re talking about, okay? free work can work strategically  you do not want to go around to everyone and be like, yeah, i ll work for free because you re gonna devalue yourself  and who cares about devaluing the field? you re gonna devalue yourself  this is not a political discussion  we re talking about ourselves and our business here ''however, free work works when done correctly  i know because i ve done it, and it has dramatically accelerated my career  and many of the people who work for me worked for me for free  this is early on  and i ended up hiring them, and they ve been paid lots of money ''so when do you do free and when do you not? you do free if you can ascertain that the person you re trying to work with has some characteristics, like they are massively influential  like for example, a new york times columnist who has connections everywhere, or a blogger with 500,000 readers a month, okay? or an author  i m not trying to say come work for me for free  i don t want anybody to pitch me right now  but there are a lot of people, or a really famous photographer in your field ''but what do you do when you work for free? you don t want to just say, i m gonna work for you for free forever  you say, listen  i m a huge fan of what you re doing  i really like the new magazine that you re building  my normal rate is actually  55 00 an hour, but i m such a fan of what you re doing that i d like to build a portfolio, and i want to help you grow this magazine, especially with your launch in the next one month  so if you re willing, i ll be more than happy to actually do this project for free, with the understanding that once we re done, you give me three referrals to other people you know  or, with the understanding that if i do an extraordinary job, we go back to my normal rate ''okay, so what happened there? i told them what my normal rate is  i said i m willing to work for free under these conditions  in other words, i m taking the power  i m not letting this guy, some freeloading guy, tell me, oh, you re just a writer  you re working for free  never  i would never do that  but i would take the power in the relationship and say, you know what? i m willing to work for free because i need x, y, and z  i need a portfolio piece  i need a recommendation from you  i need this  if you re willing to agree to that, i ll be more than happy to do it  does that make sense?''female speaker 1  um hum ''ramit sethi  is that surprising? anybody doing death threats out there? what do we have?''male speaker 1  there were a lot of people who were just laughing when you said, should you work for free? but then people were saying, i ve done it for nonprofits that i previously selected  only if it s worth something to you in the long run, in exchange for referrals, i do trades ''ramit sethi  great, very good  all these things are great  notice that the people who complain about free work and spec work, they don t even understand how this works  they re off complaining about this game, but they don t understand the game is, sometimes if you re finding that your clients don t trust you because you have no portfolio, you have to do whatever it takes to get a portfolio  and that might mean working for free for one or two clients, doing an amazing job  and now you have your portfolio, and you re off to the races, right? comment?''female speaker 1  can i share a story about that?''ramit sethi  yeah ''female speaker 1  so i had a failure with this and a success with it  so my massage therapy business, when i first started, i was all nervous  i m like, what am i doing? and i would give things away for free, completely devalued, lost so much money, took so long to raise my rates, etc  so starting that business ''now i m transitioning to kind of helping people with marketing and creative project management, and i ve worked for free for a year for my mentor and advisor  that has led to a portfolio of a great site and a great start  and but he connected me with a political strategist  and then this job came up with a company, and because i had this team and worked for free on this portfolio, i now had a decent proposal  i could be in the game and in the conversation for a new field which was outside of the other one ''ramit sethi  beautiful ''female speaker 1  so i think it s totally worth it ''ramit sethi  you re working step by step  i love that ''female speaker 1  yeah ''ramit sethi  when i was doing research at the persuasive technology lab, my professor said to me, do you want to take this for credit or for pay? and i said to him, what do you suggest? and he said, honestly, i would take it for credit, because if you do it for pay, then i m just gonna have to give you a bunch of menial work  but if you do it for credit, i m gonna actually teach you a lot of stuff  that really shaped the way i thought about it  there are more valuable things than money in the short term  way more  so really think about it ''and another guy who ended up working for me, helping with my book launch, a guy named charlie hoehn, he came to me and he pitched me all these things  he was like, hey, i think that your videos could be improved  in fact, i already did it  here you go  take a look at this video ''now why did he do that? would he do that for everyone? no  he knew that i was about to have a major book launch  he knew that i would probably have connections to other people, and indeed, i sent him so much business, he didn t even know what to do with it  so you want to work strategically with the right people  not always for free, but in certain cases, it can make sense ''all right, let s keep going  and if anyone has any questions, think of them now because we ll have about five minutes for questions at the end of today  and of course, we re gonna be back here tomorrow ''all right  so i believe this is the last one here  how to go from one client to many, or three clients to many, whatever  one thing i like to do is a referral strategy right when i agree  notice that i m taking a lot of concessions from the client, because if i m a top performer, i m like, all right, fine, i ll work with you  but you have to agree to a couple things to work with me  that s what a top performer does ''now you re not being condescending about it  you re being really polite  say, listen, one thing i do is   i just want to see if this works for you, but whenever i work with a client, i make an agreement that if i do an extraordinary job, they agree to refer me to three people at the end  does that work for you? and of course, they re gonna say yes because first, you have to do an extraordinary job  you re actually holding yourself to a higher standard, and then you re getting referrals at the end ''the other thing is, remember when we did the ask without selling technique? so i ve interviewed 20 moms or 30 people who want personal organizers  i didn t sell them on anything  i stay in touch with them  i have a little templated email, stuff like that  and at the end, i might say, listen  i actually decided, based on what you told me when you recommended i talk to sue, that i think i really want to do this personal organizing  so i m actually launching a service  i m probably gonna put up a website in a couple days  but do you know anyone i should talk to? anyone that might be interested in discussing having a personal organizer?''well, if you do that to 20 people, how many referrals do you think you re gonna get? a lot  so these are easy ways to go from three or four clients to many, many, many more  dean talked about it in detail  we cover it in detail in earn 1k  but basically, if you have clients, you already have a gold mine to go forward with  you can ask them how they found you, what sites do they read, where do they go, and then you go there, and you present yourself ''male speaker 1  mika is wondering, when asking for referrals, do you ask these clients to talk to the potential clients first, or do you cold call these referrals based on the referral itself?''ramit sethi  well, that s a good question  if they re willing to do it   you always want to respect the client  you say, what would you prefer? would you prefer to send an introductory email? i can actually write it for you if you want  or would you prefer that i just use your name when i reach out to them? the client s probably busy, so whatever they want is what you do ''female speaker 1  okay  a question from adrianne farr in england  how do you research what your competitors are charging when many of them do not discuss their prices until they re trying to close a sale?''ramit sethi  i mean, if you know your market   it sounds like you don t really know your market ''female speaker 1  well, that s very relevant for photographers ''ramit sethi  yeah  there are places   if you know your market, you re gonna have friends who are in the market who are gossiping about this stuff all the time  you re gonna see it in blogs or forums  you re also gonna just have friends who have personal relationships who are like, man, did you hear what they closed that deal for? that s a great way to do it ''the other thing is, you want mentors  so mentors and advisors, something we ll talk about tomorrow, those people are deeply connected to the field  you might be starting out  they ve been in the field for 20 years  you re like, listen, i m really stuck  what are people charging? i don t understand how to think about my pricing  they ll be able to tell you because they have their finger on the pulse  so if someone comes to me and they ask me about pricing in a specific area, and it s an area i know, i ll be able to tell them because i m deeply in that market  so getting advisors and mentors beyond relationships is critical ''male speaker 1  that s great  sid s design is wondering, what about if i charged a certain amount and booked a bride, and then eight months later, doubled my prices? the bride referred me to another prospective bride and told her how much she paid  do i give her my new prices or the prices that i gave to the original bride?''ramit sethi  new prices, but you have to explain why  you can t just jack up your prices and be like, hey, that s how it goes  you say, look, i appreciate you reaching out to me  i had an amazing time shooting the wedding with april and john  remember, you re not jumping into pricing immediately  too many creatives are jumping into pricing  pricing is the last thing  and if you do it right, the kiss, everything has already been done  it s been done right  the kiss is almost like  you know? it s like it s already been decided  it s not even a thing ''so if you re concerned about pricing, my guess is you re messing it all up over here  you re not connecting  you re doing commodity stuff  you re rambling about yourself  but you also need to explain why  and of course, she s gonna be alarmed  wait a minute, i thought you charged three grand  you re charging me six grand? well, i ve actually grown my business since then  since then, i ve added three additional services  because if you re charging double, you need to be adding more value  so one of the things that you d be getting that s new is x, y, and z  and i m also happy to do this as a complimentary service to you  remember, if you have that much margin, you can throw in a little bit of sort of bonus material for free ''female speaker 1  all right  oh, we have a question in the audience ''ramit sethi  yes ''female speaker 1  a tag question to that  in photography, there are a lot of clients who are solely price driven, and they may have looked at your web presence, blog, website, facebook, whatever  but when they come to you, they ask wedding or portrait or something, but they go directly in for the price kill  how do you take them back to the first kiss before you  ''ramit sethi  i don t deal with those clients  people do that to me sometimes too  i mean, first of all, you ve probably not conveyed value on your website  second, you ve probably had them email you  the first email saying, how much do you cost?''female speaker 1  hi, we looked at your site  we were interested in what your prices are ''ramit sethi  yeah, they re price shopping  and if you want to be that service provider, then you can answer them  if not, you say, you know what? this is what top performers who charge really high prices will do  they ll say, well, i really need to understand your needs first  and they don t just say that to back you off  they actually want to know  what kind of wedding do you want? etc , etc , etc  if you just answer their question, you re not doing them a service ''but also, i m really comfortable   people will ask me that, and i actually say to them, if price is your first question, this probably isn t right for you  but then again, that s all part of   it s very congruent with how i am, right? i ll just call people out, and they know that  so if someone comes to me and the first question s about price, i know they re not gonna buy  i know it because if you simply look at my price, you re like, wait a minute  i could get something similar for one tenth the price  you can t get the value ''so there are price shoppers, and you ve got to be really careful about simply answering them  you want to ask them why, what are your needs, etc ? and if you find out their needs are, i m just looking around for the cheapest price, well, you know what? i really appreciate that, but i m probably not the right photographer for you ''female speaker 1  so do you recommend not having pricing on your website?''ramit sethi  that depends  some people do, some people don t  if you re charging a super premium price, you ll discover that many or most providers don t, all right? if you have a price, it s really easy to compare  i don t understand what the difference is between  400 here and  200 there  how can i? i m just a client  i don t live in your world  and it s your job to teach me  not my job  my job is to simply compare, like a menu, who s got lower prices  that s what i think  but your job is to show me the aspirational side, the experience  why you understand me better than anyone else  okay ''male speaker 1  i can actually back you up on that  i am currently wearing shoes that are about three times what i had planned to pay for shoes when i went to buy some  but before i tried them on, we didn t talk about price  the guy just grabs them, was like, here, put these on, walk around in them  and i looked at him  i m like, i love them, and i walked out with them ''female speaker 1  literally '' crosstalk ''ramit sethi  literally  anyway ''female speaker 1  okay, so next question is from dc3  for hourly consulting, is it better to price in packages and let people cancel at any time than simply to price hourly to start with?''ramit sethi  i like to start hourly  i know this is controversial, but i like to start hourly because it s really simple  with dean, you start at  30 00, and you just quickly find out, the market will tell you  if you re reaching out, actually, most creatives don t reach out enough  they re like, oh, well, i reached out to two people  i m like, try 10xing that  try reaching out to 20 people a week, and the market will quickly tell you if you re pricing right or not  it ll quickly tell you stuff like, are people actually listening to me? are the words i m using resonating?''so i like the hourly thing  once you nail that hourly thing, once you nail it, you know i m in my sweet spot between  55 00 and  65 00 an hour, then you can start doing packages  and those packages, like jackie did, those will actually take you higher and higher, and actually add more and more value  but you ve got to first nail the foundation before you start going to all these fancy packages  let s take a couple more ''male speaker 1  this might be a quick one  mika is wondering, can a creative like a musician or actor use the same three steps to generate leads for gigs and landing movie roles?''ramit sethi  yeah, that s a softball question  yes  no, of course they can  it s a little more difficult because entertainment has such a supply of people who just will do anything for low rates  but there are certain techniques you can use that we talked about today and tomorrow about building relationships and side stepping the entire game  what else?''female speaker 1  oh, i thought i had a hand raised over there  this is from derek  do you have to tell a story to convey emotion every time you re pitching a client?''ramit sethi  almost every time  i didn t learn this for many years  but the power of narrative has been incredibly strong  we want a story  even products that shouldn t have a story but do  pick up the book the power of habit and read the chapter about febreze, and how that was gonna be a multi, multi million dollar failure until they found that story  it s not false, it s true  look at the story of listerine  look at the story of all these classic commodity products that actually sell for five, six, 10 times the price  and actually, people experience more value because of the narrative ''the story and the narrative is absolutely critical  you don t just come to my site, see a list of products, and then buy something  i don t even put my products on my site  i don t even think you can buy anything right now  because i want you to go through the entire experience  i mean, think about the experience of walking into tiffany, the jeweler, versus somebody at your mall  you re gonna get champagne, you re gonna be pampered  you re gonna have a very sort of high class person, probably a woman, showing you around, really telling you what looks good  also saying, you know, i probably wouldn t do that if i were you  totally different experience ''now are we all tiffany? no  but we are all trying to think about how to add more value to our client s lives  if we do that and we do some other things correctly, then the money will come ''advertising technology  why? why this?''male speaker 1  well, i ve seen a number of people that i know closely follow advertising  they absolutely love it  and i want to find something that i actually can follow and love for my first career ''ramit sethi  okay, good, good  better  try this  try this  i actually thought about that a lot  and when i was first deciding where to work, i looked at both industries  i actually went out and researched it with 10 or 20 people from each industry  but when it came down to making the decision, i thought back to when i ran my russian frat ''and actually, that is like 25 people  and one time, we had to figure out a way to generate  75,000 00 of revenue by next tuesday  hey, can you actually imagine having to do that with a bunch of college kids who don t even know what they re doing? so we actually ended up using advertising to drive a ton of revenue  and we were able to send  60,000 00 to the local charity hospital  to me, that s when i realized the power of advertising, and that s when i knew that i wanted to work here  and after i started doing my research, acme beat was pretty much the only choice ''male speaker 1  you make it look really easy ''ramit sethi  well, thank you very much  but what did i do there, right? the smile   and i m not a smiley guy  actually, i told the creative live staff to remind me to smile, because i actually still find it a struggle to smile a lot  that s true  but what did i do with the smile? what did you notice while i was smiling?''male speaker 1  it made it a lot easier to have this conversation  it wasn t like an interview  it was more like just a conversation ''ramit sethi  yeah  and i completely disarm   or you, when you smile, completely disarming  in fact, you almost short circuit me neurologically  not actually, but you almost short circuit me when you smile  that s why i said, it almost doesn t matter what you say, because when you smile, you actually connect on a totally different level ''and you know who knows this really well? women, because they smile naturally  and they can see your reaction instantly, right? they see things that men don t see, for a variety of biological reasons, and social reasons, too  so guys, and that s the reason i wanted to bring you up here  one of the things that really tests guys is body language  and body language can be this, because we tend to sit back  our legs are really spread  and also just smiling  we re like masculine dudes  and when i talk about smiling, you re kind of like, hey, this is kind of weird  this is like a little bit weird  but actually, it s very important ''so i m not saying grin like this all the time  i m saying use it strategically because what i did was i took that smile  who noticed what i did with the smile? i talked   what did i do?''female speaker 1  you smiled a lot more in the first half than you did in the second half  and interestingly, i looked around the room  we were all smiling back watching you ''ramit sethi  you can t resist it  you cannot resist smiling when someone else smiles in a genuine way  what s that doing? it s instantly making you connect  and i smiled  now watch what i did  i smiled and i said, it s funny you mention that  and i said, i was deciding between these two  i researched 20 people, subtlely showing that i do a lot of work  and then it made me remember back to my russian frat, which i ran, and we had to raise  75,000 ''now it s a pretty emotional topic  and then i make a quick little g rated joke  can you imagine doing that with a bunch of college kids that don t know what they re doing? and the guy s like, hahaha  but it s not an x rated joke  it s a g rated joke  we can all agree, haha, that s funny  at least this guy has a sense of humor  move on ''so then i was like, we had to raise  75,000, and this is how we did it  and we did advertising  i was able to give  60k to the hospital  that was a nice little   i made that up  but it became clear that there was only one choice  i mean, the guy s like, jesus, sign  here s the offer letter right now  but it s not just what i said, right?''and obviously, i have a lot of practice doing this  we can all get really good  but what i m highlighting here is the power of the narrative  you can brag about yourself without bragging  i bragged about my accomplishments in a story, right? we re gonna do one more question and then we re gonna wrap it  it didn t seem like bragging, did it? i mean, a little bit  i probably come off a little bit more, let s say, cocky than the average person in an interview  i know that, i acknowledge it  i have to consciously work with that, smile, kind of self deprecate, because i know myself ''other people know that they come off as too self deprecating, so they have to actually pump it up  so know yourself and manage it ''all right, we re gonna do a couple more questions here, one or two  we ll say   this is a tough one, all right  so drew, what is your greatest weakness?''drew  ooh  that s a tough question  i would say my greatest weakness is   wow, i really gotta think about that  can i ask you a question first?''ramit sethi  sure ''drew  out of it?''ramit sethi  no ''drew  all right  this is tough ''ramit sethi  you can ask me a question as your interviewer, though ''drew  no, i don t want to do that ''ramit sethi  okay ''drew  i would say my greatest weakness is having a tendency to do too much, and doing too much work  there s always a deadline, and there s always an amount of work you need to do  and sometimes, i surpass that and do too much ''ramit sethi  okay, stop right there  who here believes that answer?''drew  no one ''ramit sethi  you don t even believe it ''drew  it s because it s not true  you have to give me a second to think about it ''ramit sethi  i know, i know  okay, so this is an answer every single person   now, this is an answer that everyone needs to prepare to answer, a question you need to be prepared to answer  you didn t believe it  we knew you didn t believe it  we didn t believe it  so i want to highlight this  i m not coming down on you at all  this is a tough question ''if you bullshit your way through an interview, they will know  an interviewer is way more skilled than you  he sees more interviewees than you can imagine in a day  so do not try to lie  do not try to take my dream job scripts and make them your own if they re not true, all right? the point of this is to make it your own  who here has a good weakness answer? go ahead ''female speaker 1  so i ve dealt a lot with being an overcommunicator  there are times that i think it s important to give a lot of information, and there are times that i think it s important to do your job and deliver the deliverables, cut the fat  i ve noticed that in myself, and it s something that i m working towards  and i m excited to deliver the optimal amount of communication in our relationship together ''ramit sethi  what do you guys think? wow, applause  i think it s actually pretty good  i m gonna tweak that a little bit, but you actually followed the structure almost perfectly  okay, what people don t realize is when someone s asking for your greatest weakness, what are they really asking? they want to know what your weakness is, yes  in fact, every interview question follows the same pattern  they want to know the answer to the question, but they want to know the deeper answer  they want to know your key message, okay?''so when i m asking about your weakness, what i really want to know is first of all, that you re knowledgeable enough to acknowledge that you have a weakness  everybody ahs weaknesses  top performers, the best people i know  the best people i know  they are so candid about their weaknesses  they re like, well, you know what? i m actually good at a couple things, but i m pretty bad at a few things  and then they want to know that you are self aware enough to be working on them to improve it  now you just said you re working to improve it, but that s generic  you need to show me  so let me try to say that back to you, okay?''female speaker 1  sure ''ramit sethi  why don t you ask me the weakness question?''female speaker 1  so, ramit, what is your weakness?''ramit sethi  well, there s a lot  but one of the ones that i ve really noticed in the last couple of years has been that i tend to overcommunicate sometimes  so for example, i might have a senior person, like my senior manager at my last company, he might say, listen, i need this by tomorrow  and i will ask him, i understand that  can i also add this? can i also add that? what about this? will you need this as well?''and a couple of times, i noticed him being very curt with me, just saying, look, just send it to me, okay? i have other things to do  and that was when i kind of started paying attention to knowing when to give the right amount of information  sometimes you actually need to send this much  sometimes you don t need to send this much ''so a couple things i did to try and improve that  one, i actually went to a dale carnegie institute  and i attended that  and that really helped me learn x, y, and z  and the other thing i ve been doing is just paying attention to the senior people at my company, really studying how they communicate  the emails they send, sometimes they re short, and sometimes they re this long  they intuitively know how long to send  and i m just learning that  so it s something that i m definitely working on  hopefully in the cover letter and resume and emails we ve exchanged, you see that it s something that i m certainly trying to improve on ''okay? so  you don t have to applaud me  this is what i do for a living, so don t interview me  so i think i actually messed up at the beginning  i said, there are so many  that was just nervousness  i don t need to say that  that s self deprecating  this is an interview  this is not mr  ramit sethi s therapy session, all right? so i overdid that  that was not good  i thought the rest of it was good, but i thought it could have been improved  it was a little long  what do you guys think? what did you notice in that answer?''female speaker 1  when you ask this question, you re establishing three really clear facts in the candidate  are they self aware? do they know themselves, strengths, weaknesses? secondly, can they be proactive once they identify it? do they crumble when there s a mistake, or are they willing to take action and fix it? and i forgot the third, sorry ''female speaker 2  something i noticed as well, just picking that up, is that i think, especially younger people, right, drew? when things happen to us at work that are negative, like the terse emails, how many of us just sit around and bitch about it? and we re like, this person s terse to me  this sucks, this company sucks  i liked what you did where you said, i noticed that this was happening, and i looked internally for the answer ''ramit sethi  yeah  taking responsibility  super high competence trigger  top performers always do that, always  they re like, look, i could blame a million people, but there s one person i can blame  we ll go to the web in one second ''the key thing i did there that nobody quite picked up on was i told a story  you cannot stop listening to an engaging story  humans physically cannot stop listening to an engaging story  i took you along that path with me  and at each point, just as i did in the earlier frat, you couldn t stop listening  now, the story wasn t that interesting, really  i had a frat,  75k, i mean, whatever  but i had pauses  it got emotional ''same thing here  i took a dale carnegie institute   by the way, that brought down the house in this room  everyone was like, jesus, this guy just   how did he do that? i made it up  i made it up  so it s easy to make it up on the spot, right? it s easy with a lot of practice  but what could you do to address your biggest weakness? everyone right now, you know that you re gonna be asked in an interview, what is your greatest weakness? so what are you doing proactively to fix it? you could take a dale carnegie institute class, all right? you could take this class  you could buy the recording of this class and watch it and practice it again and again, okay? so there are many things you can do  or you can sit around and do nothing and be unprepared for the question ''so the main points there were the story  we re gonna do one last question  the main points there were the story  i told a story  and you came along for the ride, and i wrapped it up with a tidy bow at the end  something you will learn with practice  okay, last question  you know, drew, i ve really enjoyed talking to you today, but i m gonna be totally candid with you  i have a lot of applicants  there are some people who have more experience than you  there are some people who, they may have a better gpa than you  why should i choose you?''drew  well, i m a very quick learner  in college, it would take me   it would be easy for me to help out my friends because i would learn things quickly  over the other candidates, i think i stand out because of that fact  i m losing it right now  i m completely trainwrecked ''ramit sethi  it s okay  pick it up from the top  why should i choose you?''drew  okay  i stand out because i m a very quick learner  other people may have a better gpa, or other people may be more qualified, but i think that since i m a quick learner, i can come in and i can really get ahold of things quickly  i can learn what i need to learn  i can give you what you need  yeah ''ramit sethi  okay, all right  thoughts? how d you feel saying that?''drew  not great ''ramit sethi  okay, why?''drew  i had no idea, but it just didn t feel good ''ramit sethi  it didn t feel right  you ended on kind of a dot dot dot, right? one thing i learned from my mentor, bj fopp, he said, at the end of a presentation, some experts say don t say thank you, because the audience should be thanking you, or whatever  he s like, end on a strong note  i learned this with a lot of practice ''you ll notice every professional goes on tv  they always say, dadada and dadada  and that s why i did dadada da  it s like a song almost  but you didn t know where you were going so it kind of just dragged of  at the very least, you can restate the question  you can say, so that s why i think that i stand out among my peers, or something like that ''anybody else notice anything here? it was a tough question  for this type of question, because i ve asked you so many broad questions, these are intentionally really tough  i said tell me about yourself  oh my god  you could go in a million different directions, right? but there are frameworks you can apply to each of these questions, where it s almost like this what happens ''when i started getting really good at this, they would ask a question, and i would instantly see the map in my head  do you guys remember that movie with nash, the mathematician movie, right, and he sees those things? it wasn t like that  i m not that cool  but it wasn t actually anything at all like that  but i knew the type of question he was gonna ask because i d seen it, because i d done a lot of interviews  i also knew that i had a bunch of stories right here in my back pocket, in my quiver, right? in my story toolbox  it just came together  i also use certain techniques, like i have a couple of fillers that i can use at the beginning while my mind ramps up and it all comes together  again, this happens with practice  so can i take a crack at that?''drew  absolutely ''ramit sethi  ask me the question  wow, why should i choose you?''drew  why should i choose you?''ramit sethi  well, that s a really tough question, but i think a really fair question  candidly, you probably have a lot of people with more experience than me, so why would you choose someone who s relatively inexperienced? but the way i think about it, i think about it in three different ways ''the first one is a demonstrated interest in advertising  so i didn t just choose to interview with you because i had nothing else to do  if you actually look, i ran the advertising club in college  i actually applied some of that by running the russian frat and using that to generate  60,000 and donate it  this is something that i ve been fascinated in both on a practical level and even on an academic level, attending conferences about advertising, things like that ''the second thing is   oh, it s actually slipping my mind  oh, excuse me  the second thing is that i want to take what i ve done and apply it to a larger stage  so i ve been working on a small level, at a college level, etc  but now i want to take it to a bigger league ''and then that leads naturally to the third one, which is i, like you and like anyone, want to work with the best  so we all know that acme is the best  and i m not just saying that to butter you up  the things you ve done in terms of the x, y, z campaign and the a, b, c campaign  those are things i studied  those are things i think that i could contribute to, but i also know that i have a lot to learn  so yes, there may be people who have more experience than me, but i think if you actually consider all the things on balance, the demonstrated track record, wanting to take it to a bigger stage, and also knowing that i can contribute so much and also learrn from you, then that is the reason that i would actually select me ''okay? so i actually   did you notice how i messed up in the middle? my brain just went boom ''female speaker 1  was that real, though?''ramit sethi  that was real  i actually couldn t think of it  it was real  i didn t mess up on purpose  i m trying to make this flawless  let s edit that out, please  actually, i did mess up  my brain went blank because i wanted to take the smaller stage to the larger stage  i wanted to make that the third one, the crescendo  and then i couldn t think of the second one  so i was like, aw, shit ''so i put that as a second, and then i came up with a third one as i was doing the second one, okay? it seems like black magic right now because you re like, how is this guy doing all this stuff, whatever  but this is just practice, practice, practice ''imagine you break it down  you start to answer interview questions, you start to see the same questions over and over, testing you answers  you know the questions they re gonna ask  you know the words they want to hear and use  you get so good at this that you can answer almost anything  you see why i said that my dream job students, they can take my scripts and they can probably get a second round interview, but the top students actually know how to internalize it  they can take and parry and genuinely answer virtually any question  so does that make sense to you?''drew  absolutely ''ramit sethi  what do you take away from this exercise in terms of your interviewing?''drew  well, i know that i need to sit down and actually think of the questions and think of my answers ''ramit sethi  yeah, uh huh ''drew  and more importantly, i need to be able to come up with relatable things, stories from my background, and use concrete examples from things i ve done, and be able to relate them not just to you, the interviewer, but the company as a whole ''ramit sethi  awesome job  well done  awesome  amazing  so anyone else totally impressed by drew? first of all, just the fact to get up on stage is incredible  that is ballsy  and then the answers, for never really having done a mock interview   is that your first time?''drew  i ve done like one interview before ''ramit sethi  that s incredible  really, really great stuff  it shows you that with just a little bit of practice, you can take those answers  and in fact, he did that on the first one  he took an answer that was a bit rambly  he made it really good ''imagine if you do that five or 10 times  just five or 10 times in your life, how much better would you be than everyone else? incredible  that s how my students go on to get  20,000 raises,  30,000 new jobs  it s not because they re the biggest geniuses in the world  they understand the systematic process, and they actually put in the work and went through it ''anybody have any reactions, questions, comments on that? and then we re going to ask one of my students, robert, to come out in just a few minutes  reactions from here and reactions from the web  what do we have from here, anybody?''female speaker 1  i m highly impressed that you ve only ever done one other interview  and you were, with him, of all people, with this huge audience, oh  i mean, that is insanely impressive that you were that calm and did that well  i really hope that you feel that and take that confidence with you because i couldn t have done that  i don t think a lot of people watching could have done that, so big old konas on you, man ''drew  thank you ''ramit sethi  massive props  okay ''female speaker 1  the internet, as well, drew  folks are saying, awesome, drew  i was sweating bullets just watching you  great job  drew did it great  he was so calm ''male speaker 1  yeah, that gave me anxiety watching  good job, drew  he s so cute ''ramit sethi  drew! oh yeah!''male speaker 1  that was  inaudible  ninja ''ramit sethi  drew slipped me a 20 before so he could do a little singles exercise up here  boom  all right  so ''female speaker 1  i do have a question ''ramit sethi  okay ''female speaker 1  people are asking about how you can practice this sort of thing?''ramit sethi  oh, great ''female speaker 1  so toastmasters, people are bringing up, or other coffee chats, or?''ramit sethi  very simple  there s two or three stages to it  the first is, you actually write down the questions that you re gonna get  you can predict 80 percent of the questions, just on the top of your head  and if you don t know, go to google and search for common interview questions  five minutes, okay? this is the laziest thing people do  they walk into an interview and they re surprised  i m like, you re surprised? they asked you the questions that everyone asks  all right? so you can predict those ''the second thing is, so you can write your answers for them  literally script them out  then you can start saying them  i actually just say them out loud  and people are like, oh my god, that s so weird to say it out loud in front of a mirror  i actually think it s weird to be losing  50,  100,  300,000 over your lifetime because you were unwilling to do this for one weekend ''then what you do is you call up one of your friends who s pretty good at this kind of stuff  they don t have to be a master interviewer  they just have a good job  you say, listen  would you be willing to interview me and give me some feedback? they ll come over on a saturday  they ll ask you this ''the final stage is to videotape yourself  videotape this interaction  now this is really scary  i ll tell you, i went on tv, i went on a lot of places before i went on a book tour  and i told my publisher, will you guys get me media training?

i thought it was normal to take five days to buy a car  because that s what my dad would do  my mom would stay home  my dad would take us  he would take a couple of the kids in my family, including me, and we would go to the dealer  it was always honda or toyota  you know that  and we would start looking around  and my dad would play very innocent  he didn t know anything about cars  my dad knew everything  he knew how much the dealer was paying, how much the hold back was, everything  so we d go, we d test drive it, he wouldn t be sure, da, da, da  and then we d stay there for four or five hours and he d say,  okay, i m going to think about it   the car dealer spent five hours with my dad  he goes,  no thanks, this price isn t good  i m going to go   they re like,  what?  so we literally left ''then we go back the next day  we re basically having breakfast at the dealership  and i remember one time we were buying a car for our family  and it was the fourth day  okay, again, i thought this was normal  and we re down to the last bit  we re at the part where the dealer s drawing the numbers and telling you,  well, it s actually a really good deal   and my dad, he knows the math  he s an engineer, of course  and finally, we ve closed the deal and my dad goes,  you re going to throw in free floor mats, right?  these are  50  and the guy s like,  sir, we re losing money on this car  how can we throw in these floor mats?  and my dad says,  i m out of here   and we just walked up and left ''ramit sethi  and i was like a vietnam vet  i m just shell shocked walking out  my eyes are just glazed over  and i m like,  we just spent a week buying this car and we walked out of here over  50 floor mats   so that s where i learned to negotiate in the most elite negotiation of all  now where are your parents from?''ramit sethi  they re from india  and are they first generation? they immigrated to the us ''ramit sethi  yeah, they came here in the  70s  my dad came here actually to study  he went back to india  and it was known that he was coming back  he was a bachelor  and they sort of arranged things so that he meets people when he comes back  and it passed around the community that this bachelor s coming back  and he ended up meeting my mom  they met by both families coming together in a living room and talking  and they met each other  the families decided it was a good thing  seven days later, they were married  my mom got on a plane and flew to the us for the first time  and they ve been married for about 40 years now  amazing ''ramit sethi  yeah  we have so much to talk about  and so much to catch up on  and so many questions that i want to ask  but i thought we could start and certainly we ll bounce all over the place  but you said before we start recording, because you have a new edition of your book, i will teach you to be rich, noticeably lacking a photograph of you barefoot on the cover  and you have some incredible quotes and testimonials, i should say, including from burton malkiel, author of a random walk down wall street  but you said to me, because i haven t read the introduction, that you either should have started it or you did start it with,  i was right   could you explain? please explain ''ramit sethi  okay  so this book, i will teach you to be rich, originally came out in march 2009  and let s just dispense with the idea the name sounds like a scam  we both know we write books that sound like scams, but they re not  i mean, it s like a running   and i ve just learned to embrace it  guys, it s the weird sounding book, but it s actually good advice  and in the first edition, i talked about long term investing, low cost investing, thinking about really automating your money, and using psychology against yourself for positive results ''now if you had followed that advice, it turns out that when the book came out in march 2009, that was the absolute bottom of the recession  crazy enough  now i don t believe in market timing, but if you had used the advice in the book, this  10 book, you would be set for life  so i started the book off by saying,  well, i was right  let me tell you all the things that would ve happened if you d use this book   i did get a couple of things wrong and i had to change  one of them   man, the biggest mistake in my life was putting in interest rates in the book  like the   okay, do you remember what   sounds like me putting   doing market testing with magazines ''ramit sethi  okay, so i put in   back then, savings rates were five percent  remember these banks were paying five percent? so i was like,  oh, it s five percent  da, da, da  here s the math   and then the minute the book came out, they dropped to four, three, two, and then point five percent  now the point of it is you don t make money on your savings account anyway  we re talking about  21 a year or a month versus  4  it s irrelevant  it s tiny details  every day for the last decade, i ve gotten 10 emails a day that are like,  fuck you  where s the five percent you talked about, you liar?  and so i m like,  never again  i m never putting interest rates in this book again   so i took them out, i clarified it, i corrected a couple of things that i wanted to update, and i added 80 new pages of material  so things have changed a bit, but good advice really shouldn t change that much  now i ve had a chance to observe you as sort of an animal in the wild for 10 plus years  and part of the reason i enjoy having our conversations, but also sharing your tactics, and scripts, and so on, is that i ve seen you use them and walk the walk, which is more than i could say for a lot of financial pundits or commentators out there in the world  and i wanted to perhaps just mention a   and not really an upsell  maybe a side sell, which is if somebody wants to be either greatly informed on the arts of negotiating or if you re just looking for outrage porn to get really angry if that s your current sport of choice, you can find a guest post that you ve put on my blog quite a few years ago called, how to negotiate like an indian, which i can only imagine the response to that title if i were to publish it ''ramit sethi  probably not a good idea  but now, it s staying the way it is, folks  so there you have it  if you want to google that on tim blog, you can find it  but let s talk about some of the perhaps counterintuitive things that you do  because we talk about all sorts of aspects of finance, and investing, and life in general on the phone just the two of us  but i m looking at a number of different bullets that i was hoping to explore  and one is you ve mentioned that you ve lived in the same apartment for 10 years  why do you still rent?''ramit sethi  yeah  i get this question a lot because in america, real estate is religion  and if you re successful, then you re supposed to buy, right? and the old tax deduction, and they re not making any more land, and all these things that we say that we don t really understand  i rent intentionally  i could go buy a place in manhattan tomorrow with cash, but i don t want to  it doesn t make sense for me financially  and also, i enjoy the flexibility ''just to give you an example, i love that the building that i live in has awesome services  i love that anything that goes wrong, i make a phone call  it started raining last winter and water started coming through my window sill  so made a phone call, and they came up, and they took a look, and they were like,  we actually have to replace this part of the roof because it connects  and we have to send someone to the outside of the building   i said,  sounds good to me  it doesn t matter to me  i m going to be out of town for the next few days  so have a blast   i would estimate that that repair probably costs in manhattan on a weekend probably  25,000, maybe  35,000  i didn t pay it  right? so that s financial  also a flexibility issue, which is i don t know where i m going to be five years from now  and if you re going to buy and you run the numbers, it makes sense to plan on being there at least seven to 10 years minimum so that you can sort of eat the cost of the transaction fees ''but i think the biggest thing that really surprises people is that in america, we have been told so many times, real estate is the best investment  and in my opinion, that s just not true a lot of the time  now i don t think it s a bad investment always  but i always say you should run the numbers  and when i run the numbers in manhattan, it just makes no sense  i would rather take that money, and i would put it in the stock market  and i know consistently what that outcome is going to be over the long term  i don t have to do any repairs  and as we may talk about, i really hate anything that affects my convenience  so i think for a lot of people, i just want people to think,  hey, is it really true that real estate is the best investment?  for me, it s not  it s a cost  and i m happy to pay the cost just like i m happy to pay the cost of a basket of strawberries that i m going to eat  i don t think i m throwing money away on strawberries  i don t think i m throwing money away on rent  so you said real estate is religion or it can be  and i think this is worth taking into for a second because there are a lot of statements that in certain circumstances can be conditionally true  right? like real estate is the best investment asterisk, fine print, if a, b, c, d, e ''ramit sethi  yes  right? and there are things that are just patently, i think, untrue, right? like you need money to make money  false  it s who you know, not what you know  false dichotomy  not mutually exclusive ''ramit sethi  investing is only for the rich  right ''ramit sethi  ironically, the way you get rich is by investing   and there are a lot of different ways to invest, right? so the one perhaps undertone or portion of context that i think is worth talking about, because i ve been thinking a lot about this myself in the last 10 years, is that there are investments that you make to optimize for financial roi  and then there are investments that you make which are decisions about allocating resources for optimizing other things  right? so i ll give just a perfectly seemingly opposite example, which is i have bought real estate  i ve also had my ass handed to me a year and a half before your book came out, in fact  hello, adjustable rate mortgage first home buyer ''ramit sethi  oh  yeah, that was ugly  but i have bought real estate  typically i have used mortgages of various types  and i had a friend of mine, a different indian, who was also first generation ''ramit sethi  who is this guy? we all know each other  navin thukkaram''ramit sethi  okay  yeah, so thank you, navin, for this advice, by the way  who i ve known for ages, also an engineer  brilliant guy  and we were looking through different financial decisions  because   and i want to talk about kind of  what got you here won t get you where you want to go  type changes, right? because i imagine you do things very differently from your parents ''ramit sethi  totally   even though their behavior makes perfect sense based on their conditioning and their experience  what he said to me looking at my balance sheet, there s a small amount of principal left to pay on a mortgage  and he said,  just for your peace of mind, for this primary residence, it doesn t make financial sense  you should pay this off so that you feel as though no matter what, you have that and it s almost like a homestead   right? you have something that on many levels cannot be taken away  that s how you feel  and i did that  not saying this is the advice that everybody should take by the way  but for me in that moment, there was so much uncertainty and uncertainty in my life, to make a decision that seemingly did not let the numbers line up was, in fact, the right thing to do ''ramit sethi  i completely agree  i m so glad we re talking about the nuance because i believe there s a few underlying beliefs when it comes to money  and i believe that number one, most people are mostly the same  and that s profoundly different than a lot of people who believe that we re all individual and we have different situations  no, i believe that most of us are mostly the same  and if we can optimize   if we can basically just follow good advice for 90, 95 percent of the way, then we earn the right to take advantage of our individual specialties and differences  so for most people, that means saving a certain percentage, investing a certain percentage, et cetera  but i do think once you do the basics, then you earn the right to say,  hey, what are the nuances here? where do the rules not necessarily apply to me?  so for you, yeah, you have the principal  maybe financially it didn t make sense, but it just felt good  or it provided safety in an uncertain world at that moment ''i ve got examples in my own life where i pay for stuff that makes no rational sense  i hired a personal trainer for the last many years  that doesn t make any sense  i could theoretically find the same workouts on youtube  and they re all printed out  or i could just stop going with my trainer  why? he s giving me all the workouts  but there s something more that i get out of it  and when i was starting out, when i was 22, i wish i could go back and shake myself  because i was very utilitarian and really judgmental about how other people spent their money  and i would scoff  i would say,  flying business class is so stupid  we re all getting to the same place  i m just paying 20 percent of what that person s paying   and what i really should ve done is say,  why do they do that?  if we re listening to you right now saying you paid off a principal where you really didn t have to, you could ve just dripped it out  you re not paying much in interest  why? and for you, that safety was meaningful  for me, i like the flexibility and convenience ''so i m not saying  don t ever buy real estate  and you re not saying  buy or pay it off tomorrow   but what are the circumstances in which people who are otherwise probably pretty thoughtful make certain decisions?''tim ferriss  mm hmm (affirmative)  and the mistake that i ve, in retrospect, made a lot when i was younger   and i think that s also in part because i grew up with, by necessity, very, very frugal parents, is   sounds like much like yourself, i would scoff at and sort of look down upon a lot of behaviors that had i actually looked closer and said,  what am i missing? all right, a bunch of wealthy people are doing x  ''ramit sethi  yeah, well they must know something  now, i m like,  holy shit  i can t believe i ve missed it for 20 or 30 years   it actually makes a whole lot of sense ''ramit sethi  okay, so let s talk about what are some examples  what are some things that you scoffed at in your early, let s say, teens or 20s that now you re like,  oh, i get it   well, and i don t want this to sound obnoxious to folks because we re going to start to   we ve gone through many kind of checkpoints  right? we ve   you and i have been very fortunate and we ve made some good decisions, had a healthy dose of luck  but i ll give you an example because you just mentioned business class  my assistant i have today, my primary full time assistant, still remembers when tim, this is not that long ago, would get a middle seat economy class ticket ''because i remember when i first had people reach out to me about paid speaking engagements, which seemed completely absurd at the time  number one, i said  yes  to everything  so i was like,  what? people are going to pay me to speak? yeah, sure  yes   to everything  all of the above  and one of the options that i realized was available at one point was they could buy the tickets for me, which was, if negotiated by a speaking agent or something, usually business or first class  or they could give me the cash expected for a first class ticket  and then i could just pocket it and buy a middle class economy seat, which i did once to australia for a speaking gig that was, i mean, at the time, kind of my high watermark  right? it was a very important gig  it was critical that i do well at the speaking engagement  and i sat hinged at 90 degrees at the hip in a middle seat with my arms thrusted in front of me like a cadaver, like a dracula, for whatever, right? like 18 hours  and got there and i was just pounded hamburger meat for three days  and i said,  okay, that was very penny wise and extremely pound foolish  ''so that would be one example and i think that s the broader category of protecting the physical asset ''ramit sethi  yeah  what i like about these examples, i don t find them shallow to discuss  i think that each of us, no matter what level of your success, has gone from a certain place in life when you re in your early 20s to a different place  right? i used to read pc mag and think about what parts to build my own computer  now i just go buy a mac  it s as simple as that  and i haven t kept up and it s just not a good use of my time  i just want someone else to make the decision for me  and it doesn t matter whether you re buying first class tickets internationally or you re going to a restaurant instead of cooking food for yourself one night  one night a week or a month  we all intuitively know that as you change in life, your spending is going to change  so i actually don t think anyone should listen to your example of a middle seat and say,  oh my god, must be nice to be tim   or for me,  i have an assistant as well  must be nice   it is nice  but you might have money and you don t choose to spend it like that  you choose to spend it on something else ''i have a student of mine in this book who used the book  he told me he retired at 35  and his wife retired  they re 35 and 36  and they drive around in an rv  that s their rich life  that is not my rich life  but to him, that s his rich life  so when i was back in my 20s, what i wish i would ve done was to look at people who had succeeded in the ways that i could conceive myself succeeding  i would ve never seen myself in an rv  so maybe i didn t have something to learn from that person  but if i was really introspective and if i were really curious, i would ve said to him,  how d you do it? what d you? and why did you choose, of all the things, to travel in an rv? ''if i d done that, i would ve put myself aside  and all these things that we love to define ourselves are, which by the way, is interesting  people love to define themselves by what they re not as opposed to what they want  so you see it on dating profiles everywhere   don t message me if   or people say,  i would never do that if i had  1 million   well, you don t have to worry about having  1 million  because when you define yourself by what you re not, you won t get there  when you choose what you would want to do, now it becomes,  okay, cool  i want this  i want that  how can i work to get it?  so i wish i would ve reframed the way that i thought about money and psychology earlier on  how do the frameworks or rules, guidelines, anything that you use for financial decisions differ from those you absorbed from your parents or other people when you were younger? and there are a number of different ways to approach that, right? we could look at sort of the approaches you used to   you mentioned,  1 million  to get to your first million versus what you used after that point  right? because if it s anything like my experience, very different ''ramit sethi  totally  but i ll let you tackle that any way you like because i think what s   if people could take one thing from this conversation, it would be test your assumptions and try to be aware and it takes a lot of effort and practice of what rules you re following or biases you have that you arrived at through logic and reasoning versus having simply absorbed over the course of bouncing around like a pinball in a pinball machine in this thing we call life for the last 20, 30, 40 years  because those are not your rules  they re somebody else s ''ramit sethi  yeah, i call them invisible scripts  these are the scripts that run our lives  and they re so deeply embedded in us that they are invisible to us  and you see it  one invisible script that i grew up with was  education is always good   and i believe that  i believe that s a positive invisible script  i think that s a really good one  i m all for education, self development  that s what i do for my business and in my life  i also grew up with things like  you shouldn t pay for that  we could do it ourselves   yeah, me too ''ramit sethi  right? yeah  and so and it really trickles down in lots of peculiar ways  so there are some ways that i really love  when we used to take vacations, our vacation was mostly driving from where we lived in northern california to l a  we would visit family  my mom would pack lunches and we would stop on the way and eat  and what i love about that is we didn t need any fancy food  we were a family  we spent time together  that was vacation for us  i didn t know what it was like to stay at a fancy hotel  in fact, i never ordered room service until i was 20 years old on an interviewing trip for microsoft  so i like that  i like knowing that i grew up a little hungry  not physically, but just knowing,  oh, cool  we re happy  we re good  there s another level  we can t quite do it right now, but we re happy  ''but i think i also grew up with some beliefs that i ve shed or changed  some of them would be being really conservative with my job  if i had followed all the paths in life, i d be sitting here wearing a very oversized cisco engineer t shirt and just i d be telling you about my sales engineering stuff  it s a conservative, go get a good job, et cetera  and as i got older and i started making different choices, my parents were supportive but they were a little surprised  i think on the financial side, i didn t really understand why people would pay more  why pay more when you can pay less? but there s a famous quote from dan kennedy  he says,  if you can    dan kennedy says,  why pay less when you can pay more?  total flip of the equation  so whether that applies   who s dan kennedy?''ramit sethi  dan kennedy is a famous marketing consultant  and he has a great book out about marketing to the affluent, which if you read it, it can be a bit abrasive, but it s also like a very eye opening, shocking book  because what he points out   see, most people go through life with a lens  i call it a money lens  they put a pair of glasses on and they look at the world through a frugality lens   how can i save money?  and you see this in lots of ways  if you say,  oh, that s a really nice jacket, where d you get it?  they ll tell you and they ll say,  i got it on sale   or,  i got it for 50 percent off   oh, that s interesting  but if you talk to somebody who bought an absolute   it s something they love  this, they went to italy and got this perfect jacket that was handcrafted  they would never say,  i got it for 50 percent off   they have a different lens  maybe craftsmanship  i grew up with a frugality lens  everything was about cost  growing up now, it s also about value  so as dan kennedy says,  why pay less when you can pay more?  if you re going to have an amazing anniversary dinner, perhaps that s the place you don t need to save 50 percent  perhaps you actually want to spend more to create a memory you will never forget  dan kennedy, interesting guy  i ve never met him  but one of his books, i m blanking on the name  we ll put it in the show notes at tim blog podcast  but it s something like million dollar ideas  or how to make the most  or find your own million dollar ideas   ed  note  how to make millions with your ideas  an entrepreneur s guide  and it was, as i recall it, a collection of different business ideas and examples, which was really useful for also removing the financial lens that i would ve had on at the time, which was you make money doing a, b, or c, which happened to be whatever three things i had seen, maybe around me  and to show just how flexible the approaches can be  and i d love to hear a bit   since you have such a great sample set of students, right? what are some of the psychological blind spots or rules that most prevent people from reaching their financial goals?''and i want to touch on   so think about that  i want to touch on one thing you said, which was frugality and having grown up with a definite frugality lens  i think this is worth commenting on  that is frugality has its place  you don t want to just be flying blind because   what is it? a fool and his money are soon separated? i mean, it s like no matter how much money you have, you can spend it all  right? and i ve seen this a lot  it s not hard  so you have to have a means of assessing what is worth spending money on and what is not  however, if you make, let s just say, 20, 30, 40,  50,000 a year, fill in the number  but let s just say,  50,000 a year  if you want to reach all of your financial goals by cutting costs, the maximum amount that you can cut is  50,000  at which point you are   you ve got a t shirt and you re a wandering ascetic begging for food and so on ''so there is, by definition, a limit to the delta you can create between the money you spend and the money you have  whereas if you have an equal focus on income generation, or you re in a disproportionate focus on income generation, sky s the limit in a sense  right? so that would be one where i was trained to cut, cut, cut, cut, cut  but if you re not simultaneously looking at income generation or increasing income, it can be really problematic ''ramit sethi  100 percent  that s why most of america and most of the world has the frugality lens on, right? there s a limit to how much you can cut, but no limit to how much you can earn  and if you think about the typical financial advice, it s a very pointed question to ask,  why don t any of these so called financial experts in the newspapers talk about how to earn more money?  and the answer is they don t know how  that s not their job  they re writers  so to be able to understand that you do need the manage your costs, for example, there are a lot of things i do in my life that are highly frugal  highly  especially for the income that i have  and i just   it s not of interest to me  but i also   like what?''ramit sethi  like my wife makes fun of me because i run my entire business on a macbook air, and you know, i put my feet up on the table, i ve got my thing on my lap, and she s like,  why don t you get a new computer? that fan is so loud and i had to have    how long have you had it?''ramit sethi  so that s what i wanted to find out, i went to the apple thing in the top left corner and it shows you when you bought it  it s seven years old  but like, it still works  so i don t want another one  and i also, when i grew up, this comes from my childhood  we didn t buy a new computer unless the other one did not turn on  so i ve kept that with me and i like having little places in my life where i intentionally impose scarcity  i think it s healthy, i think it s healthy to have restraint ''ramit sethi  i think it s healthy to build that discipline  if you just go out and buy everything you can, i think you re on a quick path to a bad place  you re also aware that you re doing it ''ramit sethi  yeah  yes, exactly  so exactly  another example is i hardly ever eat out at all, and that s a big change from 10   well, i was single and i was   seamless  my seamless receipts were just through the roof  seamless is an online delivery service in new york  everybody there uses it ''ramit sethi  and now for health reasons and also just for cost reasons as well, we like to cut back on that  yeah ''ramit sethi  but i spend more on things  so i always like to spend extravagantly on the things i love but cut costs mercilessly on the things i don t  mercilessly  so i liked that  i actually would, i think a lot of people kind of try to cut back a little bit here and a little bit there and they just end up generally unhappy about it ''i would actually encourage people to pick the area, i call it a money dial  pick the area of your life that you truly love spending money on  like let s do a quick exercise  what s the area of life that you love? it gives you joy to spend money on?''tim ferriss  travel  travel and food ''ramit sethi  perfect  whether i cook at home or i go out, i would say  and now, you had a veracruz breakfast taco this morning ''ramit sethi  yeah  which was amazing  not expensive  ''ramit sethi  no, i loved it    but delicious ''at the same time, i could go to say, san francisco to like, saison  ''ramit sethi  there you go    and enjoy that as an experience  so those would be two areas  travel and food ''ramit sethi  perfect  so let s do this now  a lot of people say travel  it s one of the most common ones  mine is convenience  i like my life to be super convenient  so i ve spent a lot of money and time engineering that ''now let s take your money dial, travel, and like a stereo dial, let s turn it up  let s say just for easy math that you spend  100 a month on travel  again, easy math  what if you 10x that or let s say you 100 x that  what would travel look like for you, different than what you do now?''tim ferriss  let s see  well, it would probably mean that i have, which quite honestly i ve thought about because given some of the gnarly, crazy places i go, i ve had some catastrophes and near catastrophes  i would probably have a fixer on the ground each place i went  i would have somebody who is on call and available to effectively fix any problem or tackle any challenge or want that came up ''ramit sethi  i love that  anything else?''tim ferriss  that s the one that comes to mind ''ramit sethi  okay  because it s, yeah  that s the one that comes to mind ''ramit sethi  all right  now, what s something in your life that you spend money on but you don t really care? it doesn t make that much of a meaningful difference to you  clothing ''ramit sethi  perfect  okay, so this is, you ll find this   my fans have given me unending grief for it ''ramit sethi  you know, my wife is a personal stylist  okay ''ramit sethi  oh, man  all right  well   she won t like my budget ''ramit sethi  you talk about this   okay, so i love this exercise  there are about 10 money dials that i ve identified  travel is a big one  convenience is very rare  there s health and fitness  there s relationships  there s a few more  what i like to see people doing is actually spending more on the thing they love  health and fitness is the one where i would ratchet it up ''ramit sethi  okay  that s where i would turn the dial ''ramit sethi  what would you do?''tim ferriss  i would actually get a trainer, which i do not have currently  i have different trainers for different things, but it s all a la carte  nothing has been prepaid or pre scheduled yet, which is an issue, right? i suspect that part of the reason, tell me if i m wrong, that you like having a trainer, is the accountability and the regularity ''ramit sethi  100 percent  and i would like to do that ''ramit sethi  okay  i love this  by the way, whenever you ask someone about their money dial, you can just see their face light up, right? cause they love it  i loved, i love, i m obsessed talking about how i have built my life around convenience  i ll take you through every last detail  you can see the joy in my eyes  so what i love to do is for people to dream big  if it s travel, it s not just like adding an extra 10 percent, it s like 10x ing it  what would that look like?''and then in order to get there, whether it s twox, fivex, 10x, what would you be willing to cut back on? and suddenly people start to realize that money actually should be bifurcated  it should be highly bifurcated  it s spending very little on the things you don t like and going extravagant on the things you do  and when you start to think this way, now your rich life becomes way more specific and meaningful to you as opposed to me ''i don t need a fixer, because i don t travel at those kinds of places and i don t do the kind of traveling you do ''but for me, i want even more convenience  and now you know, i want a different type of travel now that i m married  so these are things that i want everyone to think about  what s your money dial and what if you could 10x it?''tim ferriss  this is valuable also just for people who may be listening and going,  ugh, waste of time  i don t have the money to spend 10x on it, whatever   whatever the pushback might be as a thought exercise, this is very, very valuable  in the same way that if, like when i wrote my last book, i asked myself  if i only had a month   actually, for the last two books   if i only had a month to write this book, how would i do it? ''ramit sethi  oh, really?''tim ferriss  what would it look like? and, 90 percent of the ideas were terrible  but then there were 10 that made the process i was planning on already two, three, four, five times more efficient  and so the question itself might seem absurd, but many of the ideas end up being extremely practical ''and let s talk about convenience  so what are some of the  ''ramit sethi  oh, my god    things that you do or have found disproportionately rewarding? gratifying from a convenience standpoint?''ramit sethi  well, okay, i ll tell you, but it s going to sound weird because to me, this is truly joyful and to other people, i m going to sound like a lunatic  but this is my rich life, so i m going to break it down ''i wake up in the morning and by the time, i wake up early  we started waking up at six after we went on our honeymoon  we were waking up early for safari and then we both kind of looked at each other and we re like,  do you want to keep doing this?  and so we do  we sleep around 9 30, 10, wake up at six, and by the time i start working, i just open up my calendar and i double click on whatever s in the morning  it s usually writing in the morning  and everything is perfectly organized ''the link is there  i click the link, the document is ready to go with exactly the right information  it s all organized, like there s nothing left to chance, there s no documents over here, there s no files over there  it s all in its place  you ve prepared this in advance?''ramit sethi  my assistant has and my team has, so that has all been engineered ''and i do believe that the best morning routine is decided the day before, the week before, even the year before  so by the time i get there, it s just ready to go  it s like a chef walking in   mise en place ''ramit sethi  exactly  and everything s in its place, so i love that  then on a day to day basis, things like scheduling  my assistant, jill, handles it  she s fantastic  and even when i was coming here, i walked outside to get an uber or taxi and i didn t even know what airport i was going to  i just knew that when i double clicked my calendar, it would tell me, so it s all taken care of ''finally, a couple of other examples  when i travel, especially for an extended period of time, we have something called the travel protocol, and jill activates the travel protocol  that means my plants get watered if they need to be  that means that she handles email in a different way  that means that all these details that i normally attend to when i m in the office are now attended to by somebody else  let s get super boring  not for me, not for you, but maybe for some people  is this a checklist that lives in a google document? where does that protocol, once you click on go go gadget travel  ''ramit sethi  yeah  where do the instructions live?  cause let s say jill is sick  ''ramit sethi  yeah    and somebody needs to fill in  we don t have to get into that complexity if necessary  but the instructions ''ramit sethi  yeah, they re in a google doc  there s a google doc that s roughly 25 or so pages of preferences, like when i travel, if i m traveling over five hours, i want to sit in this type of seat  it all lives there and it s updated  so it s a live, living document ''one recent thing that i updated was when i travel for a longer period of time, i want to have food delivered to my hotel so i can try to stay generally on diet  so i ll get to the hotel and they ll have a whole foods bag there delivered with food that i know that i can kind of eat on the go  and it s got a spoon too, because the first time we did it, there was no spoon and there are no spoons in a hotel room, which i had to learn myself ''so it s like a lot of iteration  but to me i don t find it annoying  i actually love it cause i m like, cracking the code of what it takes for me to be really efficient ''so it lives in a google doc  if my assistant were sick for some reason, she would transition it to someone else  and so it s accessible to anyone at the company, and we just go from there  i want to mention something  cause i m extremely particular about preferences for travel  so hotel room, not near an ice machine, not near the elevators  i have very particular thoughts on if it s a hip, cool hotel with a really loud lobby, certain max heights, but take into account fire escapes, and so on  i mean i ve a whole set of preferences ''ramit sethi  i love this  but let s just say that somebody listening as a thought exercise had dialed up their travel money dial  what you realize is that in some cases, the things you would expect to be expensive, or problems you would expect to be expensive to fix, are not expensive  like the whole foods example ''ramit sethi  it s so cheap  so you could do   whole foods may do its own delivery  if not, perhaps instacart, if not, in a place like austin, you could use favor  there are really inexpensive ways to do this ''to give you an example  so i used to, i still do ice baths  and i didn t have what i have now, which is this somewhat risky macgyver cold plunge that i ve engineered, which you have to make sure you ve unplugged before you get in  but before that, when i was living in san francisco, i had ice delivered or i would have ice picked up  i would usually stop at a gas station after the gym and like pack my trunk full of ice, which was a huge pain in the ass  and then i realized, wait a second  at the time, instacart will deliver 60 pounds of ice for five bucks  and i was like,  i am that asshole   i m the guy who was like,  can i order kettlebells on amazon prime and get them shipped for free so i don t have to pay twice the cost? ''ramit sethi  yeah  and lo and behold, i was able to do it ''so the solutions, even if you brainstorm them in a wealth exercise, do not always end up being expensive ''ramit sethi  hundred percent  that s why i m so glad you said a few minutes ago  don t scoff at the mental exercise like,  oh, i don t have enough money   dream big  dream the dream of what your money dial is at 10x  but the solutions are often so simple ''every time i travel, i will post a video on instagram of the food that was delivered and it s like classic stuff  it s like, yogurt  it s stuff that we all eat  it s yogurt, it s some almonds, maybe a peanut butter thing  and people are like,  what service did you use?  that s the question   what service?  and i m like,  the service doesn t matter   you could find somebody on craigslist  this is like a  20 purchase   20 that can change your life  and in order to get there, you just have to start with the dream  it s the money is like really the last of it  so this  20  this is my   i have a very good assistant and it s taken a quite a bit of time and it s not something you necessarily get right off the bat, and you don t need an assistant for this  but she said to me at one point, she was like,  tim   i don t know when this was, it was not that long ago  she s like,  tim, just travel with a roll of 20s and you can solve almost any problem   and i was like, that s a good idea ''and i ll give you another example of a lifestyle upgrade that does not cost a lot of money  if you go out to restaurants, choose a restaurant you think you re really going to like  go to that restaurant, not on the weekend, so say between monday and thursday  go either early, preferably like right when they start for dinner service  sit by yourself, and again, this is kind of a one time investment  go there for a week ''this is also stuff i picked up when i was writing the 4 hour chef, because i would go in with a little notebook and i would order a bunch of stuff, and i would take little notes and they re like,  who the fuck is this guy?  right? number one, the chef typically at that point is not going to be as loaded, not on booze, although that happens too  but on a like, 52 menus open at once, that s not going to happen at 5 00 or 5 30, so they might take an interest in   the maitre d  might take an interest in   you  order all sorts of stuff to try and then tip like 40 percent ''ramit sethi  mm hmm  and do that three days in a row, and you are forever a vip at that restaurant ''ramit sethi  oh, wow  so i liked that little insight  the 40 percent s not that surprising, but the three days in a row  do a couple of days in a row, so people get to know you, you get to know them ''ramit sethi  wow  and like, you re vip for life ''ramit sethi  okay  and sit at the pass if you can  so if there s a chef s table or a counter where you can see the kitchen, sit there, because most people will never ask for that ''ramit sethi  i love this  okay  i love how to take a mundane experience like a restaurant and turn it into something special  so thank you for sharing that  let me share a couple of my own  i had two experiences  one where we, i think we got something magical, and the second where we didn t do it, but we got an idea ''we were on our honeymoon and we were just having the most amazing time  we went to four different countries and we started in italy, then kenya, india, and then thailand  and the hospitality was just like, on another level, right? we re on a different planet  and i said to my wife,  if there s anything you think of or you want, just ask,  because at these hotels they really, really, really want to say yes  and we were at one hotel in thailand and my wife loved the spring rolls ''and so the manager comes out and he said,  hello, how s your meal?  dah, dah, dah  and she said,  you know, i was wondering   she was kind of nervous   i was wondering if we could have the recipe for these spring rolls because these are the best i ve ever tasted?  he goes,  you know what, give me just a minute   he goes to the back, he comes out with the chef  chef in his hat, and the chef says,  i heard that you re interested in the recipe   and he goes,  i would actually love to arrange a cooking class for you   amazing ''ramit sethi   what time are you available tomorrow?  she s like,  i can come any time   so she goes to this cooking class, private  in the back in the kitchen  not only did they make four different dishes, they even said,  okay, you know, your stove doesn t have as much flame as ours, so you want to adjust the recipe,  et cetera ''so she sends me these photos, i m just sitting in the room  i was doing some writing and she sends me these photos of four full dishes and then they were like,  here you go  compliments of the kitchen   she will never forget that  never  and it was just about asking,  how do you do this?  she didn t even ask for the class  so i learned from that, and i thought that was magical ''the second experience is a new thing that i ve added to my playbook, which is, my buddy nick took me  he s like,  hey, do you want to go to a tea tasting in new york?  i was like,  yeah, let s go, green tea   i thought it would be a typical tea tasting  you know, you go   a typical tea tasting?''ramit sethi  i don t know   just one, ah just another tea tasting ''ramit sethi  people in new york who like tea, they do it  we go there, there s like six people from japan, there s a translator, and there s a photographer  we re like,  what is going on right now?  we re like,  there s something happening, but we don t understand what s going on  ''so we re sitting there and then this person comes and starts speaking and the translator s translating and they basically say, this is the best tea in japan and it s being brought to the us for the first time  and we re like,  okay, how good can good be? it s tea   we didn t understand quality at this level  okay  so the way that we truly understood it, they told us,  you know, they only grow it on a certain part of the mountain and they use these types of things,  and we re like,  okay, okay   the way that we truly understood it was when they put the tea leaves in and they said,  okay, steep it for a second,  and they said,  drink one drop   one drop ''and we re like,  what?  and so we drink one drop  it was amazing, it was really good  i ve never tasted anything like it  and then there was a little thing that said the prices  we looked at each other, my friend nick and i, and we said,  ounce for ounce, this is the most expensive thing we ve ever had to drink,  if we were to buy it  it was like  70 per sip  crazy, right? and we didn t pay that much for the tasting  but what we learned from that was number one, sometimes quality you can only tell it by certain attributes  two, i wasn t at the level of being able to appreciate it  and three, and this was the real key  what we should have done, and what i m going to do from now on, is whenever i go to a cool, whether it s a tea tasting or any kind of interesting restaurant, i have a little playbook now ''i asked my assistant jill to put it together  we re going to make the reservation  of course i m going to pay, i m not asking for anything free, but she s going to send a note ahead of time that says, you know,  hey  ramit s coming in  he would love to be able to take a kitchen tour if you have    i was just going to say this ''ramit sethi     if you have 15 minutes ahead of time  he would love to be able to take it and if possible, he d love to post it on instagram or whatever   again, not asking for anything free, but what i ve learned is people who are the best love to share it  so there s this phrase, you know,  those who can t do, teach   that s totally incorrect  never believe that  the very best love   those who can t, wait  those who can do, those who can t teach ''ramit sethi  or they say those who can t do, comma, teach  oh i got it ''ramit sethi  yeah  and that s a total misnomer  let the very best people, like here you are, you re the best in the world at what you do and you love to teach  everyone who is the best, whether it s a chef or a tea master, they love it  so i m going to try to do that when i go to these places  and i m just like, every one of us can do that  so anyway, that was my exciting experience  so you said that one, oh, that s the one that gave you the idea ''ramit sethi  yeah  i didn t execute that yet  and the, well  there are many things that one could take from what you just said  one i want to underscore is the importance of asking  and i think that what i would hope for myself, because i m still developing my thinking and priorities will change and worldviews will change as it relates to money ''ramit sethi  right  money is an interesting thing  we can talk about like, what the fuck money is to begin with, but that s a separate thing  it s part of the reason why i have a  100 trillion note from zimbabwe framed that i put up on a wall because it s important to remember just how conceptual a lot of this is  but my thinking will change  but to stress test your own assumptions, it s very valuable to not just do thought exercises, but certain real life exercises  so one could be asking for a kitchen tour and don t, by the way, don t do it unless you re interested  and if you re not interested, go watch chef s table, like francis mallmann or one of those  like, get excited about it and have some basic vocabulary so you can appreciate what the hell is being shown to you  if you re going to do it, don t do it just to do it ''but that is a question ''ramit sethi  yeah  right? and we know someone who lives here in austin, also  noah kagan, who has his coffee challenge, right? so walk into a coffee shop, ask for 10 percent off  and you can t tell them you re doing an experiment  you can t tell them that  so and so told  you to do it  it doesn t matter what they say  so it could be a starbucks, it could be an indie  doesn t matter  and if, like,  what if i bought, what if i don t like coffee?  it s like fuck, i don t care  get a water, get a, you know, order a pellegrino, and well, order a tea  but ask for 10 percent off ''cultivating the muscle used for asking for things is so incredible  and you were talking about, you know, those who can t, teach and how there are these common sayings that are taken as true  i do   there is one that i like, which i do think is generally true and that is  in life, you don t get what you deserve  you get what you negotiate ''ramit sethi  i agree  and sometimes negotiating is just asking for what you want, right? so are there any exercises that you would suggest, or practices, phone calls, questions to people who are listening that might help them kind of stress test some of the things they have accepted?''ramit sethi  yes  i love this  so i m going to give you a small one and i m going to give you a big one  the small one is, if you have any sort of late fee, you should just use the scripts in my book  or you can google for them, and you should call up your financial institution  usually it s a credit card, and negotiate the late fee  what should they google specifically?''ramit sethi  if you don t   well, get the book, but if you don t get the book   get the book ''ramit sethi    but you can just google  ramit sethi negotiation scripts   okay ''ramit sethi  and you re going to see there, this is how it s going to go  you call up the credit card and you say,  hi  i just wanted to confirm that i ve been a member for the last four years,  and they re going to say,  yes, i see that 2000 whatever year    okay, great  i noticed that there s a late fee here of  37 from last month  i d like to get that waived, please   and they re going to, by the way, notice my tonality   i d like to get that waived, please   why sir?  well, i made a mistake, but i sent the payment in the next day and i d like to confirm that it can be removed and it won t affect my credit  ''80 percent of the time right there, you re going to get it removed and there s a reason i put that in chapter one of my book, as well as with bank fees, overdrafts, et cetera  it s that most people have never proactively taken control of their money  they just accept the world the way it is   ah, the credit card screwed me again   no, you can get that back and once you get that late fee back you re like,  oh, my god, i can actually have control over this  these companies work for me   so that s the first thing i would say ''the second exercise is a little bigger and it s more conceptual  right now i m doing a small coaching program with like 150 people, i m walking them through my book  and it s like this private group and i m just walking them through every chapter, and i asked them a thought exercise a couple of days ago  i said,  if i gave you  10,000 tomorrow or if you just found it, no obligation, no strings, what would you do with it? ''okay  tim, what do you think they said they would do with this  10,000?''tim ferriss   10,000  this is just like right off the cuff  pay down mortgage or invest in an index fund, but i m guessing closer to the former than the latter  i don t know ''ramit sethi  okay  you re pretty, pretty close  so it turns out that according to these answers that they re all saints  we have a bunch of mother teresas in the group  they re like,  i would pay off my debt,   i would give 10 percent to charity    i would do this and that  ''i m like,  you got  25,000 of credit card debt  you re telling me that you would magically take this money and just pay it off?  what they were doing was they were having a very optimistic sense of their future selves  i would rather they say,  i actually don t know what i would do with this money  based on my past behavior, i d probably just spend a lot of it   or  i have no system or way of thinking about what to do with my money   that would have been more honest  yup ''ramit sethi  instead, when faced with what we re going to do in the future, we re really optimistic   oh, i d work out four times a week    i d pay this off    i d pay for my parents  retirement   what i would really like to see, people, is go through this exercise to start with your optimistic self and then try your realistic self ''if you say you re going to pay off all your debt, why are you even in debt in the first place? clearly you didn t have a system that would keep you out of it  so i think for people, whether it s a  100 a  1,000,  10,000, whether it s, you know, you could even go as big as somebody just gives you a house, what are you going to do with it? i haven t even done that myself  but you could play with the concept ''and then remember if you don t have a system, like for me the answer is,  i would put it straight into my system, put in the checking account and money would be withdrawn to certain places  20 percent would go here, 10 percent would go there  some money would be spit out for guilt free spending   and i d probably go buy a beautiful sweater  where did they  ''ramit sethi  that s where it always ends up  you and your sweater ''ramit sethi  i know  i love them  so where do those funds go? if you re comfortable talking about some of the places?''ramit sethi  sure  so you get 10 grand, you put into the checking account, and then it gets kind of put into this process ''ramit sethi  yeah, it s a process map, basically like an email inbox, and it gets filtered and shunted where it needs to go ''so day to day, my spending is very consistent except for two areas  rent is the same, food is basically the same  everything is pretty stable  i like to put, my target is i start by saying i want to save and invest at least 20 to 30 percent, and i think that s a good, healthy number  if you re doing that, the rest of your life is generally in control  it s 20 to 30 percent and because we don t have kids right now, my wife and i ve been talking about our numbers  we want that number to be towards the higher end  20 to 30 percent, just technical question  is this pretax, or is this taking into account taxes?''ramit sethi  that s a great question  it can be either  i always like to be more conservative  always  so post tax is really good if you can do that because you re, you know, you re going to be putting more in  but really for any of these numbers, if it s post or pre, you re generally in a good place anyway ''so then that money is getting saved and invested, and investing is like, i tried to go more aggressive on investing  because we re young, so i put that into things like a target date fund and you know i love vanguard and i recommend them  i don t have any deals with them, but i think they re the best  that s where i put   what is a target date fund?''ramit sethi  a target date   i understand all the separate words, but i don t actually know what that is ''ramit sethi  okay, so very quickly everybody thinks investing is about picking stocks and like sitting here and looking at the screen that looks like minority report  that s not investing  investing is very simple, low cost funds, and these cost you almost nothing these days  we re talking about 0 1 percent expense ratio  it s very, very low cost ''what you do is something like a target date fund is you pick a target date that you re going to retire  so if you re 30 and you re going to presumably retire at 65? that s 35 years from now  so there s a target date fund called vanguard 2060 fund, okay? and what that does is it s like a pie chart  it s pretty aggressive in your 30s because you re young and as you get older it gets a little more conservative  basically what it means for you is that you don t need to do anything except put money into it automatically every month ''i love this as a great simple, low cost way to invest, and the bulk of my portfolio is either in target date funds or individual index funds, so that money would go in there  i have some money in sub savings accounts  i ve got some targets like, you know, i saved up for my wedding before i was, before i even met my wife, saved up for an engagement ring  i like to plan ahead, so i have those numbers  same for a down payment on a house, which eventually i will buy even though it doesn t make sense for me right now, but i still plan for it  also vacation, like midterm goals, you re talking about roughly one to five or so years  how do you keep these things separate, or are they only separate in a spreadsheet where you re keeping track? how do you not commingle  ''ramit sethi  yeah, i like keeping them separate because i think it s like   separate meaning separate bank accounts ''ramit sethi  well you can have sub savings account   i see, sub saving accounts ''ramit sethi  so capital one 360  kind of like an authorized employee on a credit card account or something like that ''ramit sethi  exactly  just for tracking purposes ''ramit sethi  for tracking purposes  i also think it s nice if you have one big old commingled account, you don t really know what s for what  what i would encourage everyone to do is, think about what do you want to save for between one to five years and for one year there are things like christmas gifts, like you know, that s a known irregular expense, or it s a known regular expense  it s coming every december  if it s 500 bucks, you might as well start saving now ''then there are things like an anniversary dinner  there s also mistakes  i used to have a stupid mistakes account because i used to get a lot of parking tickets  i don t do that anymore  thank god  i don t need to plan to for that, but then there are things like a down payment, maybe getting married, things like that  above and beyond five or so seven years, i just put it in the market because i don t need it and it just grows, then   you re putting it in the market with a target date fund?''ramit sethi  target date fund  yes  those over the long term over history have returned about eight percent  if you do the math and you go to one of these calculators like bankrate or something, you can plug in the numbers and you ll see that your money doubles roughly every  it s the rule of 72  72 divided by 10, it ll double about every seven years  that s why compounding is so powerful ''if you start now and you put even a hundred bucks a month in, that number gets very large, very fast  that s the power of investing  the rest of the money pays my fixed expenses like rent, things like that  finally out pops guilt free spending  this is my favorite part   the sweater account ''ramit sethi  the sweater account  that brings me to my two things that are variable  travel, i tend to overspend on travel a bit and clothing and i ve set up this system, because now i ve sort of advanced my financial system where a lot of it is automated  i have a meeting once a month, i have a personal cfo, we kind of look at it and i basically told them i want my document prepared in this way ''i want an executive summary  i want the expenses categorized as such and i only want you to flag the following ones because these are the ones i m variable on  i don t really care if i spend 20 bucks more on deodorant  that doesn t move the needle, but like too much on travel, i got to know about it so i can kind of correct over time  that s how i think about the spending  okay  to next topics, i thought we would discuss prenups  this is a topic that is shied away from a lot  it seems to be an important topic at least in the us and it s something that came up in conversation recently and you joked that you might be willing to talk about it on the podcast ''this is one of those subject areas that is i think neglected  i ve seen a lot of difficulty and angst and pain and discomfort faced as a result of i think an unwillingness to make it more of an open conversation  where should we start with prenups?''ramit sethi  i m an open book man, i ll tell you anything  all right ''ramit sethi  this is one of those things that when i walked into it, i didn t know anything and i only knew what i had heard on tv, that prenups are bad or they re for people who have generational wealth that s been inherited  i didn t know anything  then i discovered when i talked to friends, there was so many people who have thought about this or gone through it, but none of it is online  it s all behind closed doors  prenup, prenuptial agreement  what is a prenup, what s the purpose of a prenup?''ramit sethi  prenup, sets the terms of what you are coming into a marriage with  it is acknowledgement that certain people might have certain assets or interests, like a business or cash or investments, whatever the case may be  it also sets the terms for if the marriage ends for whatever reason, what is to be done with those assets, specifically the pre marital assets  that s what a prenup is about  okay  how did you think about this? because i ve heard some disaster stories of this process being handled poorly or terms not being perhaps reviewed as carefully  i should point out also that this is not a male female thing ''i ve seen this in same sex couples  i ve seen this in cases where the woman is coming in with significantly greater assets than the husband to be  how did you think about this, and what s one of the smarter ways to go about thinking about this?''ramit sethi  well, i ll tell you what i did and i ll tell you some mistakes i made too  the reason i want to talk about this is that i want to shine the light on money topics that people don t talk about  i want people to be informed ''you can make your own decision, but i walked into thinking about getting married with a lot of preconceived notions about what a prenup was, who it was for, and just to give you a sense, like nobody around me ever signed a prenup growing up  it just was not a part of my culture  i started thinking about getting engaged a few years ago and my girlfriend at the time, we were discussing it and   discussing what? the engagement? possible engagement ''ramit sethi  what s going to happen eventually and we re together for the long term, things like that  i started looking into it and if you google how to sign a prenup, you re going to find a lot of really generic and borderline bad advice  it s from disgruntled redditors and it s from like askmen or these magazines where they have these things, this advice, like you should blame it on your lawyer or you should blame it on your parents, or how do you get away with not making your fiance mad?''i just thought this is not the way i want to start this relationship   and this financial relationship as well   because that s what marriage is  it s legal, it s financial, it s also love  you re a team in every way  i sat down, i did a lot of research, i talked to a lot of my friends and the thing that shocked me was when i started bringing it up with friends, so many of them, especially entrepreneurs, had lots to say  lots ''i ll fast forward to what happened with me and my girlfriend at the time, we sat down, we had a really serious meeting  we actually had a google agenda  we came with our bullet points and we had a very adult meeting where we talked about   this is just the two of you ''ramit sethi  just the two of us  no legal counsel or anything like that?''ramit sethi  no, no, no  we were just the two of us  we talked about, when would we like to be engaged and married? where would we live? do we want to have kids?''tim ferriss  just to be clear, this is a life logistics meeting and not a prenup meeting  maybe part of it, but it s a broader conversation ''ramit sethi  i hadn t even brought the prenup up  yeah ''ramit sethi  okay  we go through kids and i told her, i even mentioned to my wife, i said,  let s talk about the names of our kids, because i never saw myself having some kid named mike  i don t want a mike running around in my house   and she s like,  what the hell? where s this coming from?  i m like,  i just feel particular about this  '' then it s thor or nothing! thor or nothing   we go through the list and the good news is we were generally on the same page  it s a funny thing, she goes,  i d really like to be engaged by q1 of next year   i m like,  oh, my god, this is the girl of my dreams  she s talking    q1 ''ramit sethi  in financial quarters  i m like,  i love you, babe   then at the end of that conversation i said,  there s something else that s important  it s really important to me that we discuss a prenup,  and she was surprised, kind of taken aback  she s like,  okay, what do you mean?  i said,  look, you and i grew up very similar  we both grew up in california  our parents have similar jobs   and i said,  because of certain decisions i ve made, because of my business and because of a lot of luck, i ve been put in this fortunate position where i have a business and i ve accumulated a certain amount of assets  ''i said,  it s really important for me that we talk about what that means before we get married and that we sign an agreement, in the worst case if something bad happened   i was nervous, very nervous because, what is someone s reaction going to be? i have no idea, but i thought if anything, is going to be bad, but i was nervous, but i also felt confident because it was something that i knew that i wanted to do  it was really important to me  to her credit, she said,  you know what, i m surprised  i didn t expect it, but i m open to it  let me get educated about it and we can talk  ''okay, great  that was as good of a response as i could have hoped  she goes off and she does her own research  she talks to her friends and we start discussing more and more, right  we ve got about four, five months until i propose to her  we start talking, the next step is to get lawyers ''now, interestingly, you have to retain counsel  each side has to retain counsel  oftentimes what happens is, the person who has more assets will actually pay for the other person s lawyer, which i did  these lawyers are very expensive  i said,  you know what? i ll take care of that  i m happy to do it  ''she found her own lawyer and we start to go through hammering these basic terms out  now, the basic structure of a prenup is  most people don t need a prenup because most people are coming into a marriage with relatively similar assets ''the places where it starts to make sense, or if you have some major amount of assets, whether it be a house, whether it be an inheritance, a business, those kinds of things, it starts to make sense to think about  i had to get   intellectual property ''ramit sethi  yeah, absolutely  i had to get comfortable with the idea that this wasn t a bad thing  i wasn t planning for us to fail  that s the most common objection people have to prenups, which is you re planning for it to go wrong  i m not planning for it to go wrong  i intend to be married forever  i want to, i always emphasize that with my wife and i made it clear that we re a team, but i also mentioned that i ve for whatever reasons, i ve accumulated these things and it s really important for me to plan for what might happen ''as we talked more and more about it, it became even more and more clear that in every other part of life, top performers plan, they plan ahead, they plan for good, they plan for bad, they plan  it s like just in this one situation of life that society has told everyone,  no, that s wrong  you shouldn t plan at all  you should go into it like a doe with these doe eyes and you shouldn t really think even for a moment about what would happen if something goes wrong   yeah  i mean, you get on an airplane, they give you a safety briefing  they don t stop because they expect the plane to crash into the water ''ramit sethi  that s a great example  it s also a place just to jump in where because i ve thought a good amount about this, just relationships and marriage in general is that when you get married in official capacity, you are involving the state in your affairs ''you are signing up for surety and contractual agreements and so in any well planned agreement, you re going to have contingencies for what happens if things do not work out ''ramit sethi  yeah  there s going to be a termination clause  you re going to have that in a publishing agreement  you re going to have that in any number of dozens or hundreds of other contracts you will sign, will always have a separation clause ''ramit sethi  the reason why this is such a heated topic for people, i think there s two reasons  one, there s just a general ignorance of prenups because it is inherently a private affair  inherently, when you have assets being discussed, it happens behind closed doors, specifically lawyers  closed doors  it s not public  there re no good guides or no e books on how to do a prenup ''there s nothing, there s not even any sample prenups out there  they re very, very poor quality  the second thing is it attacks our belief that in america, a marriage is purely about love  i believe a marriage is absolutely about love, but go look at any parents or any couple that has, let s say kids  go look at them and look at their day to day  yes, there s love, but there s also teamwork  this person s doing dinner, this person s taking the trash out, this person s changing the diapers  it s an arrangement  it s a team ''on any team, you have to have a set of rules  i got comfortable with that saying,  you know what? this is a love marriage  we found each other, we met each other, we love each other, but it s also we want to make sure that this is a team and we re setting expectations   we went through the process and we talked to our lawyers and the lawyers are hammering it out ''this is where it started to get really tough  everything was going great, but then once you  everything s great in concept and then you talk about real numbers  if i may, what are the basic terms that you re agreeing upon in a prenup?''ramit sethi  the first thing is you re laying out all the assets that each person has  those could be assets, liabilities  you kind of put those all out on the table  by the way, that was a good conversation that we had  i forgot to take my own advice about when to talk about money with your partner  my wife had asked me years ago to help her with some 401k thing and i was like,  yeah, i ll help you, but first read my book  ''she reads my book and then she was like,  okay, i still have this one question   we went through it and i got to understand her pay and all that stuff  it was great, like we worked through it  a year or two later, she said,  i feel a little unbalanced because you know everything about my finances, but i don t know anything about yours  ''that was when i realized i had made a huge mistake  by not telling her, i had put myself in a very unbal  she had been placed in an unbalanced position  she s not fair  that afternoon we talked about it and we talked about my net worth, we talked about what it means for us  that was, i would say one of my most pleasant conversations  most pleasant?''ramit sethi  yeah  because we talked about what does it mean for us  like our rich life now, what does it mean and it means that when we travel, we can take our parents with us and we can spend extra for them to stretch their legs out  we can travel to places or we can make certain investments or take risks that we might not normally be able to do again as a team ''that was actually one of my favorite memories of talking about money in the early days  now, we had listed out all our assets and liabilities and now the basic structure of a prenup is  what happens in the case of the marriage ending?''there are so many ways to cut it  no two prenups are alike  what happens if the marriage ends in three months at an extreme? in many cases a cheque is written  can you believe that? if a marriage ends in three months, somebody might write a cheque to the other person  why? just like pure goodwill  severance pay ''ramit sethi  you could call it that  yeah ''ramit sethi  both partners might still have a job, et cetera  what happens if the marriage now ends, 30 years later, let s say there s two or three kids, let s say that one partner has stopped their jobs so that he or she can take care of the kids ''well, it s kind of fair that that person should be compensated in some way because it would be unfair for somebody to walk out of the marriage with just this large amount of relative assets and the other person left with nothing  that s just not fair  it s not fair in my eyes personally, and it s not fair in the state s eyes either  in each of these cases or in most prenups, is it a lump one time payment or is it like an ongoing annuity that gets paid each year  ''ramit sethi  that s a great question  yeah  what does it look like?''ramit sethi  it can be decided however you like, but each lawyer is going to argue for their side  the person who would be receiving the payments is going to want it all upfront  right ''ramit sethi  right  there are also other questions about what if you re living in a house with kids and the marriage ends, who leaves  how soon, that has to be dictated, and then there are other questions about, is there a cap on how much can be paid out? and that s important too ''understand, though, a couple of things  the money that  i m going to speak generally now, the money that is earned when you are together is generally community property  when you are married, generally the money that is earned is together  it s yours ''there are certain exceptions like if you have a business, there s this and that and you can kind of carve those out ahead of time  in general, we re talking about money that was accumulated before the marriage  that s really important to understand  kids are definitely a complicating factor, but you are not really dictating the terms of child, of what s it called?''tim ferriss  custody ''ramit sethi  custody and also payments  the state will determine that  that s really important to know as well  you can t come up with a rule right now that says,  if we have three kids and this marriage ends, i m going to write you a cheque for  1 or  1 million a month   that can t work  the state will decide based on lifestyle  can i ask you a question, just from my perspective?''ramit sethi  yeah  why get married at all? what is the reason?''ramit sethi  wow  because i do really dislike, and this is something that i talk about it usually in the first few dates  i mean, i have a great girlfriend right now, but once we ve covered  what do you want for your main course?  pretty quickly the subject comes up, it s like, yeah, marriage, not keen on having some bureaucracy involved in my relationship ''ramit sethi  it s a great question  also it s like if you re coming into a relationship where the current trajectory of earnings is vastly disproportionate, the idea of having a bureaucracy involved and having sort of everything past a certain day become community property, doesn t have a whole lot of appeal to me  were your reasons for getting married, your desire, your partner s desire, your families, multiple families expectations, or are there other reasons?''ramit sethi  it s a great question and i think only in this day and age can this question really be asked, because as recently as 25 years ago, this question would have never been asked  it would be like,  yeah, of course you re going to get married   now you and i both know plenty of people who are either single or in cohabiting relationships or casual or whatever the case may be and they re perfectly happy not being married ''i think for me the answer is probably all of the above  it was a desire on my part, a desire on my wife s part, and also our families  this might be an invisible script from my childhood that i always saw myself as married  there s a lot there  the way i thought about it was,  i love my wife, i love when we re together, she makes me a better person, and i think i do the same  together as a team, we are amazing  i love laughing with her  i love how she challenges me and i want to deepen that relationship  ''the financial part of it for me was a part that i wanted to address, but i also felt confident knowing that we could solve it, that we could come to an agreement  i didn t see it as adversarial at least until the middle part, which i want to tell you about  okay ''ramit sethi  i approached it like very much like can do  it s like hiring someone, like i m going to make him an offer, i want to make him a great offer, and i expect that we re going to have some back and forth, but overall it s about coming to an agreement that we can both work in a capacity together ''now i know that sounds a bit unromantic for a marriage, but i m talking about the financial part of a marriage  there s so many different layers and we  in america only talk about love  what i m trying to share is like, there are lots of other parts like be aware of it, don t put your head in the sand  you re not talking about marriage as a concept  you re talking about the contract of marriage  if you get married  ''ramit sethi  it s a contract  whether you go down to, the whatever it might be, i m blanking on the term, but like some office downtown to get rubber stamped, like you re entering into a contract with multiple parties ''ramit sethi  yeah  you can enter into a very nebulous contract, or you can enter into very clear contract ''ramit sethi  i always say for every major purchase in your life, every major purchase and every major decision, spend the time  most of us should spend less time on most decisions and we should spend a lot more time on a few key decisions ''i want to take this seriously, so did my wife, so we did  we spent months, right? now here we are, the lawyers are going back and forth and it s starting to get a bit slow  they re arguing and now we re talking about it  it became stressful and at some points like pretty heated  okay  i was like  i mean there are so many things that happened during this time ''one, we would just stop talking about it for weeks at a time because it was just too stressful  we had never had these kinds of conversations before about money  my perspective was,  i ve thought about money for 15 or 20 years every day  this is my business and i m really proud of what i ve accomplished financially and i always love to come i made a very fair, very fair offer bending over backwards  ''that was my perspective  my wife s perspective was very different and i think that i didn t listen as much as i should  i was like,  i, i, i  i came out, i did this, i made this offer   she would say something and i would say like,  look at this spreadsheet, look at the numbers  ''she was like,  yeah, but,  and she was talking about something else in a completely different language and i was so preoccupied with like mr  spreadsheet guy  finally, she said,  we got to go talk to somebody about this  we should go see a therapist   i was like,  yeah, we really should  ''i totally agreed with her  you might wonder, where do you go to find a therapist? for us the answer was yelp  we literally opened up yelp and typed  therapists  and we found one two blocks away  that s how it s done, guys  we walked over there and we sat down in this room and we had a conversation like we ve never had before ''this therapist was very good  she asked us about how we grew up with money, what it meant, and it turns out it meant totally different things to us  for me it meant being proud of what i ve accomplished  it meant all the work and for anyone who s built anything, you know, the sacrifices it took to build that  you look back, you can remember friday nights where you didn t go out or you can remember x or y or risks you took ''i was seeing that, and what my wife was seeing was something different  money meant something different to her  this therapist helped us kind of bring that up and we find ourselves  we went one, two, three sessions  we find ourselves talking about our childhood and it s kind of like a caricature, like a joke of what you talk about in therapy session, but we walked out of each of those sessions like  wow, that was pretty good  that was pretty helpful  ''we still were having the lawyers go back and forth, but now we were connecting more with each other financially and we were reminded by this therapist, like,  we re a team  this is just an agreement we need to come to,  but remember why you are together  remember why you re getting married ''we finally came to an agreement and we signed it  it s funny because one of my buddies, he held an event called should you sign a prenup? he invited like 20 or 25 people, right  one of his friends who was married and had done a prenup, sent him a note and said,  i d rather be dead than come to this event  ''he was like,  whoa why?  he s like,  dude, that was the worst six months of my life  imagine you have someone you love and you re arguing about money with lawyers for six months   i didn t get that until i d gone through it  i would say that in retrospect, i learned a couple of things  number one, i should have talked about money with my wife way earlier, like way earlier  i violated my own advice and that was horrible  i should have talked about it earlier ''two, i should ve stopped being mr  spreadsheet dude and actually listened and said like,  let s put the numbers aside and talk about what money means   for me, like i told you, i m proud of it  my wife wanted to feel safe  she wanted to know that if anything went wrong that she would be taken care of and i didn t really internalize what that meant to her ''what does that mean? i should have listened, should have gone to see a therapist earlier, and we should have not let it stretch out for as long as it did  that was really torturous for both of us  how would you have expedited it?''ramit sethi  well   therapy earlier, i mean ''ramit sethi  i mean, that s why i m here  i want to share with people  don t just hope that it will kind of work itself out over time  everybody involved in the process wants it to stretch out  the lawyers, they re not trying to just bill you more, but their incentive is to get you the best deal and the other lawyers to get the other one ''you have to take control and manage the process, but both of you have to be aligned on that  i would have definitely talked to a therapist ahead of time with my wife  we would have gone there together faster and we kind of would have   i would ve started off not talking about money, but rather about meaning ''that s something that i m hoping to be able to talk more about, but i hope people listening to this, if you go in and you ve got a spreadsheet that you want to discuss, you ve taken a wrong turn  that s what i did  i should have talked about meaning and fears and hopes about money as opposed to like, let s go through the numbers  the numbers are the last part of   i was going to say it s not either or, right?''ramit sethi  it s sequencing  both ends ''ramit sethi  you got to talk about the numbers, but once you get meaning aligned, the numbers work themselves out  when we ve chatted about this sort of in passing in the past, because i wanted it to make sure we did it on the podcast  a couple of stories have come up that, i m not sure how to grapple with  now, i m at a point also where i haven t had conversations with attorneys about this type of thing, although, i mean, it makes sense to think about estate planning, whether your estate is small, medium, or large ''it makes a lot of sense to think about that  things can be really messy speaking as someone who had grandparents who didn t think about anything and we re not rolling   doing backstroke in a pool full of coins like scrooge mcduck, but nonetheless, when emotions are heated, kids can fight over anything, even if it s just table scraps, and that was a mess  i don t want that to ever affect, if i have kids, to affect my kids  so you should think about it earlier, but the point i was going to make, because i haven t gone through the actual drafting of say a prenup, but i ve seen marriages implode  and the numbers, if you just like let s try to coldly, objectively look at the numbers in the u s , they re not that hot ''so it makes sense to plan whether it s driving with a seatbelt in your car, you re not planning on getting in an accident, but you want to be covered if you do  i ve heard horrible stories, right  so i ve heard stories of a friend who had a prenup, went through all of the same process  and then i think it was a week after he got married or just before he got married, his wife to be or wife said,  i signed the prenup under duress  ''ramit sethi  oh, my god   i don t   i don t feel good about it   and it was back to the table  now under duress for people who don t know, is   this is not a legal definition, but under extreme stress  therefore, the position of the person who s claiming duress is that the contract is invalid because they were pressured into it and this can apply to quite a few contracts, it turns out  and he was in a position where he had to go back and it was renegotiated and the numbers changed, so the lump payments and so on were changed, and so that s fear inducing ''ramit sethi  that s scary  that you could have an agreement and then end up in a situation like that  and point number one, whether it s legally forced upon you or just practically day to day, you re like,  well, where the fuck do we go from here?  and have to then step back into negotiation mode  and i ve also heard of approaches   i m not saying maybe this is getting too much into the dark arts or something, but where friends have thought,  all right, if i m going to   if i m trying to defend against the worst case scenario, would it make sense for me to go engage x number of very high caliber divorce attorneys so that they are conflicted out if we ended up having a divorce later?  that s a little voldemort, but i can also see the practicality of it  so how do you think about what landmines you might need to avoid, if there are any?''ramit sethi  yeah  it s a big question, but it s like this shit gets messy ''ramit sethi  i would say that i ve spoken to a lot of different attorneys both in getting married, but also as a ceo, and one of them told me something really interesting  they said that the people with   the lawyers with the most interesting stories are criminal lawyers, of course  the second most interesting lawyer stories are workplace attorneys  i would be willing to bet that the third is divorce attorneys, because the stories are just out of this world  i didn t really approach it like that, to tell you the truth  i didn t plan on the marriage ending  i simply wanted to account for what might happen financially  so let me put it this way, if at the point where you re sort of already thinking about  let me engage all these divorce attorneys,  which i don t even know if that works or not  i ve heard it s a rumor, but i feel like there s a larger problem going on there, a much larger problem  these lawyers are not stupid  they re all very good ''they ve seen it at all and the thing is to negotiate in good faith  you have to remember, you re not trying to get one over on your partner, you re   if you were just trying to get one over like a car dealer, you re trying to maximize it because it s a one time transaction  this is the partner you re going to be with for the rest of your life, so that actually necessitates a different way of negotiating  when i was discussing with my attorney and that attorney was negotiating with my wife s attorney, i had to compromise on things that i normally would not compromise on and that, just to put it bluntly, i haven t had to compromise financially in the last 25 years, at all  so suddenly i m like,  what? what is this taste in my mouth? i haven t tasted this taste of compromise   this bile ''ramit sethi  yeah  but that s why i think it s really important  a couple principles came up for me  one is, go slow to go fast  i should have done a better job of this, of let s talk about   the meaning ''ramit sethi  the meaning, go slow to go fast, and the second one was,  always remember the north star   the north star here is not getting an extra dollar or protecting the extra  2  it s  we re going to be married day to day for the rest of our lives   that s the north star and putting that in perspective, as the lawyer s saying this or that, i had to constantly remind myself, so did my wife  and by the way, i just want to say she was excited for me to come here and talk about this  she actually encouraged me because i wrote about it in my book  i wrote some more details and i asked her, i said,  are you okay if i share this?  and we talked about it ''we both realized going through this that both of us were pretty alone  no one was talking about this publicly and we re both big fans  she s a stylist  i do what i do  we love shining the light on things that people are not really talking about publicly because we re both very curious and we both want to get better  so if she had said  no,  i would have never written this stuff  i would ve never come on here and talked about this, but she actually said  yes, go on there and tell them our experience, because other people should know this, whether you do it or not, you should know   all right, i ve questions  so this is going to be a super awkward one, maybe for me to ask more than for you to answer because you re being put on the spot, but i m the one who has the option of asking whatever i want  so this is something i ve seen so many people struggle with, what i m about to bring up and i want to hear if it affected you and if so, how you used mental jiu jitsu or contortionism to get through it  and that is, if you re coming into a negotiation, say for a prenup, and you are the person who s bringing in disproportionately the assets and income   and that could be not necessarily a 51, 49 split, right?''i mean this could be a 90, 10 split, 99, one split and it very often is, i mean it can very often be  when you re looking at the settlement and the amount   so it s very hard for someone, let s just say, who s made  10,000 a year to ever imagine what it really means and what it takes to make  100,000  ditto if someone s making like 50 grand a year, what does it mean in terms of sacrifice and planning and fridays missed and weekends worked and holidays skipped to make  1 million  and so all of a sudden then, you re going through a negotiation where someone who has perhaps not made a decade or two decades of sacrifice, is asking for an amount that is more than you made in the first 30 years of your life ''how do you navigate that, because there s   viscerally, i know a lot of people, and i m one of them, who s just like,  that makes no sense   and it also brings up,  well, wait a second  if that s the amount that gets paid out, i would start questioning the sort of motives of the other person   it s like,  okay, well, they were able to kind of do whatever they want for x period of time, but now if we get divorced three years from now, they re set for life if they don t screw it up   how do you   i would   that would make me feel very uncomfortable ''ramit sethi  me too  i mean i think   remember when i said that i was proud of what i had accomplished and you go through so many emotions in this process? and the funny thing is when it comes to money, i m not emotional at all  day to day, i m super   i call it hot to cool  i think most people or some people particularly those in debt, money is like a phantom or a gremlin  it s a beast that they re fighting  they need to break the shackles of this debt  i ve overcome those things  to me it s a tool and i use it for convenience, things like that  so to find myself going from nervousness in bringing this up to pride that i wanted to talk about the numbers and i was very proud of what i had accomplished and what it meant for us, and then resentment ''i definitely felt resentful because to me i m like,  look at the spreadsheet  i have gone above and beyond, and how can you not acknowledge that?  i found myself experiencing these emotions i hadn t honestly ever felt about money and i think that s where a therapist helped me, but i should ve done it sooner because it really was not healthy to just sort of soak in them for literally months  and remember, we re seeing each other day to day and so that definitely affects you as you re planning a wedding with your partner  it s not   it s like the worst opportune time  if you could sequence it out, you re like,  don t do that  ''i think that it s a question that i don t have a good answer to  i think that the basic   there are certain things in life that are just not fair, okay, and one of them might be this, but really that s not the point  the point is not for me to win   that s what i learned along the way  at least this is my lesson  some people might think differently  my point in retrospect was not to win this negotiation  it was to win our marriage, meaning both of us get there together as a team and if i have to compromise a few things, which in business, i would never have made a couple of the compromises i made  but this is more important than my business, this is the person that i m going to spend my last days with  so that actually really put things in perspective for me ''it s like, oh shit  sometimes you learn about yourself just by observing what you, yourself, do  and i was like,  did i really just agree to that? that one term we ve been discussing for a month? yes, i did  wow, my wife is that important to me,  and i realize,  yes, she is   so i don t know, i don t have a good answer for you on that, but i ll tell you, i really swung emotions  i felt resentful and i hate feeling resentful  it s one of the most toxic emotions, but i think there s something larger than being right in this  maybe that s just what i tell myself  yeah, no  i mean that s   i think cutting off your nose to spite your face to be right doesn t make sense  i also think that the opposite of   i think it s possible to play not to lose or set yourself up for blind spots while not at all costs trying to win ''ramit sethi  a hundred percent, a hundred percent  don t be an asshole and make a bunch of insistent demands based on principle that don t practically make sense is fair, but walking into something blind and just offering yourself as a pinata doesn t make sense either ''ramit sethi  okay  you know what s crazy about this whole thing now? so once you sign it, it s done  in fact, at least in our case, we were like,  all right, thank god  we don t want to look at this now  file it away  good   the real challenge actually, since we got married just about a year ago, has been day to day spending and that now using the tools we learned from this therapist and also going slow to go fast  my dream, okay, my fantasy was to have this just beautiful financial model, okay, that s what i wanted, like this model that we d look at and everything s going from side to side  we ve built that  it s taken eight or nine months  what i realize now is, emotions first  what does it mean? who s cooking dinner? who s taking the trash out? let s get all that stuff done  the model part is the last part of it and because we had these tough conversations earlier on, now we re like,  okay, let s start with the emotions  ''we have buffer, so if we overspend a little bit on eating out right now, that s okay  we ll dial in the numbers later  what i ve realized is the numbers really come last and so we are both really thankful we went through the process, although i wish we could have been   i wish we could ve had some guidance, really  but funny enough though, once you sign it, it s not like you re reviewing it every single day  it s gone  yeah, it s the day to day, now  it s literally the littlest things like  who s picking up x at the store?  that s where day to day financial stuff comes in and that s another area where i think you use the i will teach you to be rich stuff  the systems, the idea that you don t really want to be spending your valuable cognition on who s buying deodorant or rice, have a system, automate it, boom  we were talking about   we won t spend a lot of time on it, but your relative who you thought was 65, you and your wife thought was 65 or something, ended up being 87 ''ramit sethi  yeah, my uncle  and how regimented   regimented is the wrong word, how much of his life is routinized  he wakes up at the same time and we were describing coffee earlier and i said,  i wonder how much of his longevity is that lifetime accumulation of avoiding decision fatigue on shit that just shouldn t consume your brain every day? ''ramit sethi  at all  so i believe, just like you have a playbook, i believe in a playbook for life  here s a couple playbook rules that i have  one, i call it ramit s book buying rule  if you ever see a book you re even remotely interested in, buy it, don t debate it, don t ask if it s the second best   just buy it  it s  10, it s the best money you ever spent  have a year of cash, have it available, liquid and if you don t have it, build up to it  save up for big expenses, engagement ring, wedding, honeymoon, all that stuff  house   sub accounts ''ramit sethi  sub accounts, boom  when i eat at a restaurant now, my joy is if i see anything that looks good, i just order it  and i also tell the people eating with me, do the same, don t even think about it  and so my coworkers love eating out with me because i m like  just order it all, i got the bill   just a quick side note for anyone who has not seen it, it came out not long ago from the time of this recording, but there s an incredible espn article on coach gregg popovich and the dinners and the wine for the spurs  it is phenomenal ''ramit sethi  it s fantastic  people can look that up, anyway ''ramit sethi  have a couple of areas in your life where you have absolutely no budget  doesn t matter how much you spend, you just love it  unlimited ''ramit sethi  unlimited  there is no   if you love strawberries, like when i grew up, i loved strawberries, but we had a big family and strawberries were expensive  there is no amount of strawberries that will ever cause me any material difference in my life  it s three bucks, four bucks, five bucks, six bucks, doesn t matter, buy it  have something   it could be as small as strawberries, it could be as big as whatever  eat the   this is for me personally, a lot of people don t agree, but eat the same thing, mostly the same thing, every single day  i do it  it s just easy decision fatigue  i do the same thing ''ramit sethi  yeah  and then also   so this is what my wife and i have been talking about recently is,  let s come up with some rules for our relationship too   these are guidelines  we can change them, but we were planning a vacation  we re going to stay with a friend for their birthday in mexico city and we re looking at flights and i find that we re deciding which flight, should it be economy, should it be business, what hotel, this or that  and i said,  hey, let s get into it  let s kind of figure out where we like to travel together in what style, but over the course of the next few months, let s kind of come up with some basic rules  ''for example, if you re traveling over five hours   for example, if you re traveling over five hours, business class, or if we re staying just the two of us, we don t need a fancy hotel  whatever the case, make a basic guideline so that we don t have to think about it all the time  and even down to like who s taken out the trash, let s just kind of articulate that and be explicit so that it s all on the table and that way it clears up any misconceptions  so i love this general playbook for life, especially   so wait, what s this   what was your conclusion on the trash?''ramit sethi  oh, dude, i take the trash out  okay ''ramit sethi  and it just got revealed, because i would notice the trash filling up and then she would take it out once in a while, but really she would say,  would you mind taking the trash out?  and it just became very clear in any relationship, there are certain things that one person does or doesn t like to do, and like the same thing s true for cooking, ironing clothes  cass cooks, i iron  quick note on that  one thing that i ve found really helpful is whether it s with friends or your significant other, but especially significant other, is agreeing in advance from a scale of one to 10, 10 being absolutely heartfelt must have or must not have  you can t use a lot of 10s  so you only really get a couple of 10s in your pocket, so don t spend them on nonsense, but asking someone zero to   one to 10, how much do you like doing this, or one to 10, how much do you hate doing this? and it s like, all right, if to you it s like you don t love taking out the garbage, but if it s like,  eh, i m a five out of 10, six out of 10, who cares?  it doesn t really matter  and she s like,  i grew up in such a way, i hate taking out the garbage,  like,  okay, fine, i ll take out the garbage  ''ramit sethi  wait, so what s your 10?''tim ferriss  on liking or not liking?''ramit sethi  ah, let s go both  so i, for instance, very fond of cooking, very unfond of cleanup ''ramit sethi  love it, classic  yeah ''ramit sethi  and what about something you hate?''tim ferriss  well something i hate would be the cleanup ''ramit sethi  okay  other things i hate would be, for instance, i am much happier to pay for things if i can avoid decisions  so if my partner s willing to handle logistics   we went to burning man, it was her first time and i knew what i was signing up for  and i told her, i was like,  i will go, but only if you handle the logistics  i will pay for everything, but in terms of getting costumes and getting everything there and the bikes and the lights and the   you need to be the coo of this operation and i m happy to be the controller who approves the checks  ''ramit sethi  love it  but that s it ''ramit sethi  got it  so i love that you re explicit and i love that one to 10  i have to think about that  i ve overheard my wife talking to her parents and i grew up with my mom cooking food for us every night  every night, right off the stove, she would be giving us rotis or whatever she was making and we all ate together as a family and i really loved that  so every night, my wife will either make food or it ll   she ll have cooked it a couple times and then she ll bring it to me and that is so meaningful to me because it reminds me of my childhood  and by the way, the food that we eat is extremely inexpensive  we re not getting the fanciest cuts of meat  we don t care about that, but it s   we track all of our macros and all that stuff, so we care about that, but really it s about the meaning behind it  macros for people who don t know, fat, protein, carbohydrate ''ramit sethi  yeah  percentages of each  what does the pie chart look like?''ramit sethi  i don t know the math off the top of my head, but it s like every week it changes depending on whatever my goals are  and i think the meaning there is really important and then there s certain things for cass that she likes or she doesn t like and i ll do   trash is a perfect example  i just kind of discovered she really doesn t like taking the trash out  no problem  it s easy for me to take it out  so getting those on the same page and developing this just life playbook of general rules of thumb you re going to use, especially for stuff that s not important, man, that really frees you up to really get into the stuff that is important  yeah, for sure  so i know we don t have too much time left, but i want to jump into one of these because i m curious what you will say in response to some of these questions and we may only have time for one or two, but these are from people on the interwebs  always a risky proposition, but they were voted on or upvoted and one, this is from scott, no last name here indicated  where does ramit disagree with what tim teaches or preaches or   and i ll just rephrase that, but what do you think we disagree on?''ramit sethi  this is a   this is one of my favorite questions  and it could be anything, but fire away ''ramit sethi  oh, my god, i love this  i think that we disagree on morning routines  i think they re overrated  i think that the best morning routine is decided a year ago  it s about your psychology  it s about how much you sleep  it s about what have you outlined in your calendar  it s all those softer details  and i think that   i get people asking me every day what s my morning routine? and i m like,  who gives a shit?  you think if i asked michael   i m not saying i m michael jordan at all, but if i ask michael jordan what shoes he wears or what his morning routine is, am i going to be like mike? no  and similarly, if you find out what kind of coffee i drink, you re not going to be doing what i do either, but i know that you re not saying that, but that s what people are taking away and it drives me insane  well, yeah  i mean what  ''ramit sethi  can you please correct the record tim?''tim ferriss  what one person tries to impart and what people hear are sometimes very different ''ramit sethi  the 4 hour workweek  tim, you work more than four hours  yeah, yeah  i m just like, okay, thanks for   yeah, right  the gift that keeps on giving  so morning routines i think are number one, for me, coming back to what we just said, morning routines are one example of removing decisions, that s it  there s a little bit more to it for me in the sense that as someone who had onset insomnia and slept very poorly for several decades, i would wake up and be nonfunctional generally speaking, so having a boot up sequence which didn t require any thought  i m not deciding what to eat for breakfast  i m not deciding what step number one is  do i do a, b, c, d, or e first? no  i m always going to be doing b or a, whatever it might be, has been very helpful  i also know equally or far more successful people who have your answer  they re like,  i wake up, i drink a fucking cup of coffee and then   ''ramit sethi  i scroll instagram first, literally the first thing i do is i get on instagram while i m in bed  it s the worst possible thing, but i m like, i like it  yeah and  ''ramit sethi  is that unhealthy?''tim ferriss  wonder what accounts? anyways, it s all cabins  it s all cabins, i swear to god  the question i think that is also just a macro questions worth asking is, is this person you re looking at succeeding because of or despite what you re looking at? this is really important  it s especially important if you re studying people who have already reached escape velocity in some type of success or financial freedom and you re still working your way up because hindsight is not 20 20  a lot of folks who are on top of the world and are just crafting billion dollar deals every day, do not remember very clearly what helped them when they were working in the office on thanksgiving or whatever it might ve been ''ramit sethi  this is a great point and so powerful  by the way, this is why i love your podcast because here we are, two people who seemingly disagree on something, but now we re getting into the nuances and we can really crack the code of what s the differences and similarities  i will totally agree with what you just said about the more successful you get or the more time you get away from something, the less details you remember  i ll give you an example  my wife started   she used to be a senior buyer at equinox  she left to start her own styling business about 18 months ago  i would hear her doing sales calls in our living room and i would see her sometimes closing a client and sometimes going weeks without closing a client ''and i ve got a business now, i ve got amazing employees, we ve got traffic that s coming, we ve got people coming and regular customers and all that stuff, but when i started off, that shit was not easy  i would go weeks without getting one person joining any of my programs and i forgot how emotional it is  the highs are so high and the lows are so low and half the game in this is just living to fight another day  it s just not giving up and improving just a tiny bit every day  and i watched it and i heard her and i saw her go through the ups and the lows and it s amazing  now, this month she told me how many clients she s done  she s totally booked up for two or three more months  it s amazing what she s accomplished in 18 months ''she never would have believed it, but you forget and you forget fast, the tiniest details of what it means to wake up in the morning and say,  wow, the last four weeks i haven t gotten one client  am i going to do it different today?  so i just   big shout out to every entrepreneur who s starting out out there  it s tough and you should always put in context the advice that you hear, and thanks for bringing it up because people need to know it s not all roses  shit is hard when you start  it s hard for everyone  it actually should be hard, but if you stick with it, hopefully you re doing the right thing  you can get escape velocity  so morning routines, one thing we have somewhat differing approaches to, what else?''ramit sethi  tools  i think that tools are super valuable  people love to talk about tools, but you give andre agassi a wooden racket, he s going to kick my ass  so i think when you ask   if somebody asks me like, what apps do i use? my apps are horrible  i don t use   i use tripit, that s it  it s   but i think the more powerful things are the psychology, are the systems which are run through a google doc  that s my take on tools and so that s   those are my two areas of disagreement  curious to hear what you think about the tools and also if you disagree with me on anything  well, i provide a lot of tools because i think the specifics are helpful, but it s the reasoning behind it i would imagine, we re probably on the same page with and that is, the tools are by products of principles or strategies  for instance, i use tripit too  i think it s underrated, but people are like,  okay, great, i m going to go use tripit and life s going to be grand   it s like,  yes, but, maybe but, what are the principles behind it? it s so that i can avoid manual checking of things like gate updates  it s so that i m avoiding a certain decision, certain manual activities that are being automated  it s so that i don t have to go   i don t have to go to google or wherever on my phone and search fill in the blank airline check in, because i can click a button and tripit will do it automatically whether it s delta, united, american, whatever  ''and that principle, if you were to pull it back, will be   will then allow you to deduce which tools to use or at least ask people for the right tools  but it s very easy to believe that,  oh, wow, so and so s a great player    so and so s a great business person    so and so s a great artist because they use watercolors   it s like  no, whether it s watercolors, oil, conte crayons, doesn t matter, charcoal, graphite, you need to know the technique and the principles behind it and the process, then you can choose your tools   i think it s easy to become a tool fetishist without understanding why you re doing what you re doing  and then you become kind of like, where is it, solomon islands where they have the cargo cult, where they have the fake runways and the fake towers and it s like,  okay, great  you have a phone full of the greatest apps  you ve got 79 different rules for email filtering and guess what? you didn t do one fucking important thing today   there you go ''ramit sethi  so   okay, i agree with you on that  i think that s really good and i think the way you articulated   deduce what tripit   what the principles behind you using tripit are is critical  i do the same thing  we use it for the same reasons, but i also take that same principle and apply it to what i do in the morning and how i decide what place to meet someone for coffee  all that stuff has been automated so i don t have to think about it ever again  so that s a good point ''ramit sethi  yeah and i would say also that i think there is a   it is possible, very possible and actually very common to procrastinate by searching for incrementally better and better tools  oh, i do that all the time ''ramit sethi  and i could do the vast majority of what i do with a day planner  yeah ''ramit sethi  and in fact, i think the finite nature, this is why i still use paper, i still use note cards or small pieces of paper for to do lists and things like that, because it is by its very nature finite  i cannot have a list of 37 things i need to do ''in some respects, i think applying constraints to the tools that you use in the same way that   and i had neil gaiman actually sitting right where you are on this podcast not too long ago and he uses, very often, a fountain pen and pads of paper for drafting  and it sounds very romantic   and it is in some respects   but it also has a number of psychological and practical benefits  but it seems very primitive  it s not the latest cutting edge tool  all right  i love it  that s a great explanation of the nuances behind tools ''ramit sethi  yeah  so yeah, i appreciate that  let s see  where else? and it s also easy i think for us   we could disagree on tools all day long  we could disagree on the implementation of various things, but here s i think one observation that is important and that is you and i are not the same person, meaning you like fancy sweaters  i m wearing an  8 t shirt that my mom got me  right?''ramit sethi  yeah  and these pants and these shoes were both given to me and i m not wearing socks  so we have different desires  your vacation may look differently from mine  your family in india is different from my family on the east coast of this country and that s all fine  that s great  and it also means that the way we approach problem solving is going to be different ''ramit sethi  yeah  that s a really good point  but a lot of the principles i do think are very similar ''ramit sethi  mm hmm (affirmative)  the values and the principles are similar, otherwise i don t think we would have been friends for as long as we have ''ramit sethi  totally agree and i think there s value in the diversity of how we think  there s also value in knowing that those will change over time, right? so as i ve gotten married, i m like,  oh wow, there s this whole world i didn t understand before and now i m learning that and i m growing with my wife  ''i think as we ve gotten in relationships, we ve talked about how that s changed us  wow  and that s a pretty interesting topic  and then you know, if we had anybody else here who maybe didn t look like us or if they weren t our gender, we had all different kinds of diversity opinions, we would have even more ways of thinking about how we approach problems ''and i think what i have learned along the way   when i wrote the book for example, i was a bit judgmental about what the rich life was in the first edition  i was like,  this is how you should invest, follow the principles, and this is where you end up  ''now, 10 years later, there s a lot of people in the fire community for example, that s financial independence retire early, and many people are happy to acquire enough to basically be able to live on 30k a year, live a very simple life, and if they want to have a fun afternoon, maybe they ll go to the park  and they re like,  we don t need materialistic stuff  we re happy  ''and back then, i think i would ve been pretty judgmental about it  now i ve realized there s lean fire, there s fat fire, there s all kinds of different fire, and some people don t want to fire  in fact, most americans will never fire  they will work until they re of retirement age  but rich life looks different to different people, and part of that comes from how are we raised  what do our parents tell us? and then part of it is, do we want to change that story, or do we want to just go with that?''tim ferriss  question about retirement  i was going to ask this earlier  so this   i ve read about this as far back as my equally scammy sounding book, 4 hour workweek, a thousand years ago  but there s this concept of retirement, right  let s replace that with financial freedom,  cause i want to ask you what that means or how you think people should think about it, because a lot of thinking about retirement i find to be extremely porous at best  it s very faulty ''ramit sethi  well in your book, you got a great example of mini retirements and  you want to buy a ferrari, why don t you just rent it for a week?  yeah ''ramit sethi  great example  or you think,  okay, 20 years from now, everything i m doing is predicated on being able to buy a boat and i m going to live on my boat and sail around the mediterranean for 20 years after that   it s like,  maybe you should get on a boat first  ''ramit sethi  yes  and try that for a weekend  go take a sailing course  you might come out of it being like,  that fucking sucks and i felt sick the entire time  ''okay, good to know that now and not when you ve kind of slaved away and done something that you find distasteful for 20 years  and people mess up the math too, right? they often miscalculate and end up having a very tough time in retirement, per se ''so with your students, how do you encourage them to think about the objective?''ramit sethi  yeah  well i don t believe that most people are automatons that sit down and say,  here s my 50 year goal, and let me break it down and reverse engineer it to what i m going to do this week   i know about two people like that and they re special on their own, but most people don t do that  most people are very simple  they want to wake up  they want to have a good day at work  maybe they want to have a little bit of fun or watch netflix or have a good conversation with their partner or their friends  and that s a good day  and that s okay ''now, to kind of push people out of that and make them think a little bit bigger, it might be taking a vacation they may not have done  it might be going to a tea event that they may have never thought of going to  it s these experiences that people remember  i would say that your comment about retirement is really true for people our age  i don t hear anyone saying like,  when i retire, this that, my pension  ''those conversations are not happening with our generation  so there s more of,  what do i want to do? ''there s more spending on things like wellness and vacations and experiences  and we re seeing that in the economy as well  what i tell people is a couple of things  number one,  you may not think right now that you want to retire, but when you look at everybody else who reaches a certain age does, if everyone does something, it might be true  ''and so plan for it  i don t want to buy a house, but almost everybody else does, so i saved enough for a down payment  i don t need to use it, but it s there if i need to  similarly, don t wait, right? and think bigger  so don t wait means go take a trip for three days, and think bigger is like, your retirement doesn t have to just be sitting around ''it can actually be much bigger  that money dial, turn it to 10  and it could be traveling with a fixer  it could be going for a month a year, or two months  but in order to do that, you need to build a muscle now of thinking bigger  people have this linear belief that  once this bifurcation of retirement happens, then the curtain opens and i get to do all this cool stuff   dude, if you haven t been doing it until you re 60 years old, you re not going to magically do it at 60 years old in one day ''so i would encourage people to start building the muscle just like you ve told  em and realize that doing creative things, trying different things, is a muscle  i found myself getting lazy with this in new york  i looked at where i d gone to in the city over the course of the last six months and i was like,  i live in this amazing city and i m not even taking advantage of it  ''so i put it into my calendar, once a quarter minimum, i m going to do a cultural event like a show or a tea tasting, whatever the case may be  something that i could only do in new york  and so now it s on the calendar  and you can say it sounds unromantic but i m like,  that s what i needed to do that to keep building my muscle of trying new things  ''so whatever works for people, do it, but i would say don t wait until you are retirement age  yeah, and i feel like so much in our conversation has come back to making one decision that removes 1,000 decisions  in the sense that you put it in your calendar ''ramit sethi  yeah  and for me, if it s not in the calendar, it s just not real, right? so even what we call batching conversations, with me and my girlfriend for discussing certain constant, not issues in the sense of problems, but we have regularly scheduled times to talk about certain things ''ramit sethi  we do the same thing  and it s in the calendar ''ramit sethi  same  and that s true with certain types of date nights  if we re talking about relationships, right? it s true for taking trips together ''ramit sethi  yeah  it s true for visiting my family, visiting her family and by making that decision and putting it in the calendar, you preserve your brain power and emotional resilience and so on for other stuff that is less predictable ''ramit sethi  do you have a consistent thing you talk about on your check ins?''tim ferriss  we do, yeah  we have a whole format and everything ''ramit sethi  yeah  okay, so this is amazing  i love meeting smart people who apply their intelligence to a different part of life  for example, there s a book out by gretchen rubin, who we both know, and she s just so smart and she decided to write a book about keeping her house and workspace organized  and i m like,  yep, bought it  ''ramit sethi  and the stuff she writes about in there is clever, interesting, it s exactly what you would think a smart person applying themselves to something for a year, would come up with  and the fact that you and your girlfriend have   we call it a touch base or a check in and you have a consistency, it s on the calendar, i love that  and   yeah ''ramit sethi  i want to know what s on that? what surprised you?  cause we re going through building our own one and we re tweaking it and i m like,  this is awesome   she s much smarter about anything involving emotions ''ramit sethi  oh, god  that s funny  my wife is the one who suggested it for us too  much more observant than i am ''ramit sethi  it s like two cavemen talking to each other  yeah ''ramit sethi   hey, how do you feel, tim?  so she s much  '' are we good?   we re good    okay, great   that would be our check in   we good? we fucking good?  cause i don t really feel like having this conversation    yeah we re good    okay, great   maybe this will be helpful for folks  we ll spend a few minutes on this  we have a number of rituals and things in the calendar that i think are important for the care and nurturing of the relationship  and one epiphany that i think we both had at one point was that a, i have a tendency to emotionally shut off or get defensive with a lot of questions involving emotion or emotional vulnerability ''ramit sethi  mm hmm (affirmative)  it s just not something i was fully exposed to growing up ''ramit sethi  yeah  there was   or in school or with coaches  really the feeling was and i m not going to say in my family as a whole, but i come from a pretty   what s the right word here? stoic, and not in the cool, hip marcus aurelius sense, but a fairly stoic, protestant like environment where in school for instance and in coaching, the general feeling was like,  don t tell me the good stuff  cause the good stuff takes care of itself  tell me what needs to be fixed  ''ramit sethi  yeah  turns out that s not, i ve come to realize, the best approach for longevity in the relationship that i want to have with my girlfriend, which had to be pointed out to me ''ramit sethi  this is amazing, because just think about this  what got you here?''tim ferriss  yeah ''ramit sethi  something got you here to a very elite level and it would be easy to just be like,  oh my god, i ll just keep doing what i m doing  cause i won that game  ''you re playing a different game now  well i think that the question i didn t ask for a very long time is   what did it cost? ''ramit sethi  yes  and what was the collateral damage?''ramit sethi  wow  right   cause it s like,  yeah, the hulk s a great fucking superhero  he also makes a fucking mess  ''ramit sethi  that s a good one  and i think that there s a lot of collateral damage that i probably didn t notice ''ramit sethi  yeah  and certainly didn t weigh very heavily because i was like,  yeah, but look what i did  ''ramit sethi  totally  or  yeah, but look what happened!  and it excused a lot of mess ''ramit sethi  100 percent  so what we realized after that was pointed out to me was   or what i then said to my girlfriend because she was curious about how to better word things so that i wouldn t have a disproportionate emotional response ''ramit sethi  that s cool that she was curious about that  yeah  she s very good at asking questions and probing because if   i think i have a sensitivity as someone who s effectively worked as a freelancer for decades, that if i have my headphones on and i m in the middle of a project, i don t want to stop and have a five minute conversation about something extraneous  i get unnecessarily spun out over stuff like that  and she says,  well, how should i phrase things so that it s easier and less distracting for you?  and i remember saying, i said,  it has nothing to do with the content  it s all timing  ''and that was a real breakthrough for our relationship, not because we had the conversation  this is really fucking important  cause like,  yeah you can go to fill in the blank seminar  you can read fill in the blank book  you can take fill in the blank drug and have this amazing epiphany and do nothing with it  ''what we did from that point was then set up what we call these batching times, once a week or once every two weeks, where we sit down and she has a chance to talk to me when i am prepared to talk about things that are going to make me uncomfortable  and she can handle it whenever  cause she s more adaptable and resilient in that way but   i can blame it on my upbringing, i can blame it on being just a weirdo, who knows? or just a heteronormative male who doesn t like talking about shit, who knows? having that time blocked out where i can steel myself and warm myself up psychologically to talk about things that are going to make me uncomfortable is very valuable in the format that we currently have ''so we couldn t find any real great advice on this ''ramit sethi  same  and the format we have is we will take notes, we have meeting notes after every one ''ramit sethi  mm hmm (affirmative)  and it s where we capture in bullet points what was said  so we start with   one person will start and they ll say what they think they ve been doing well ''ramit sethi  nice  and it didn t start out this way but it s ended up   they start with what they think they have been doing well or doing better  then they talk about, if they want, where they think they ve dropped the ball or could focus more, which is very helpful for diffusing things ''ramit sethi  yeah,  cause they bring it up themselves  yeah  then they will tell the other person what they re doing well and then they will tell the other person    we started off with shit you need to fix,  or that was part of my phrasing  and then it was growth opportunities  and now it s what i would love to see more of ''ramit sethi  nice  and the phrasing turns out to be really important, right  so it s what i think i m doing well since we last checked in, what i think i could do better, what you re doing well, and then what i d like to see more of ''ramit sethi  yeah  and then we take notes and we forward it to the other person and we can take a look at it  and that s it ''ramit sethi  amazing  it usually takes an hour  maybe two hours and  ''ramit sethi  is this in the morning or in the evening?''tim ferriss  usually in the afternoon or evening on a weekend ''ramit sethi  oh okay  interesting  that s most common ''ramit sethi  okay  yeah ''ramit sethi  so the note part is also interesting  so you take notes  i take notes ''ramit sethi  for what she s saying  no, one of us will take notes on the whole thing ''ramit sethi  okay, okay got it  there s kind of one secretary or minute keeper for that session ''ramit sethi  that s cool  and so it could be me  i take notes in notebooks a lot so i d take notes in a notebook then take a photo and send it to her ''ramit sethi  mm hmm (affirmative)  or she ll take it in notepad on her phone and then send it to me ''ramit sethi  that s an interesting part of it too, is each person will have some skin in the game in terms of recording it  yeah ''ramit sethi  that s powerful  and then i have an evernote where i out all of our check ins in reverse chronological order  so the most recent is at the top ''ramit sethi  yeah  so i can go back and look and see did we   and this is not as a gotcha, it s just to like,  all right, did i keep up my end of the bargain? did i say i was going to work on something three weeks ago and then i kind of forgot about it? ''ramit sethi  totally  two weeks later ''ramit sethi  but also, not just from the avoiding bad but doing   more of the good ''ramit sethi  more of the good, yeah  like imagine after a year   yeah ''ramit sethi  you go and you re like,  oh my god, we have been super consistent and look at the things we used to talk about and look at the things we re talking about now   yeah, the highlighting what is being done well is really important ''ramit sethi  yeah  and it s so against every behavior and habit that i ve built over my entire life ''ramit sethi  yeah  but i have come to realize that without that  ''ramit sethi  yeah  it can really, really be tough ''ramit sethi  so one of the things that i love about this   first of all, thanks for sharing those things  yeah ''ramit sethi  super helpful, as we are starting this ritual on our own  and i think this is a great example   and by the way, my girlfriend did 90 percent of that so i m along for the ride but  ''ramit sethi  yeah  i want to give her proper credit ''ramit sethi  totally  i think that s an example where the ritual itself may be even more important than the content  yeah ''ramit sethi  the ritual of having the time, having it on the calendar, respecting it, always showing up, being mentally present and tracking it, that is like 90 percent of the ball game  yeah ''ramit sethi  and that just shows this awesome mutual respect you both have for each other  and the fact that you take it seriously and it s not weird to write down an agenda, i think so many people are   they think about things as weird  yeah ''ramit sethi   oh, it would be weird to have a google agenda  or be weird to save for an engagement ring  i m not even dating anyone  ''well, i think it s weird to live life as most people  yeah ''ramit sethi  i think that s weird  i would rather plan ahead  i would pick some things i want to do differently and just be unapologetic about it  so i think it s really cool that you re sharing that, including down to what are the questions   cause i m going to take some of those and take it back to my wife and we re going to do this  it s really been a big deal for us  and like you said, i think the intention and the act of calendaring it is of great value, aside from the implementation ''ramit sethi  100 percent  the fact that you are both setting aside time to keep the relationship on the rails and to improve it is in and of itself going to have an impact on the relationship and there are times also when we ll out these batching sessions out   we ll schedule them out and she s better at this than i am  i could actually find enneagram pretty helpful even though i m not convinced it s more than business acceptable astrology basically, but in any case, enneagram can kind of be interesting as something to fit in to this  we can talk about that another podcast, but very important to her to schedule things out ''ramit sethi  mm hmm (affirmative)  and if we schedule it out for say, four or five weeks, there are times when we ll look at it, we ll know it s coming, it s like,  okay, are we going to do this?  and it s like,  no, we re good  ''ramit sethi  yeah  there are times when we don t have a critical mass of stuff to talk about and it s like,  no it can wait   we ll just do it, we can push it a week ''ramit sethi  yeah  and so for my experience this far, better to have it on the calendar ''ramit sethi  yeah  and then say,  hey, we can play hooky  ''ramit sethi  make it an opt out instead of opt in  exactly, than to not have it on the calendar and have to hit defcon 5 when things boil over ''ramit sethi  dude, everything that s important in life should be opt out  everything  it should be by default, it s going to happen  it s on the calendar and whether that is call your mom every sunday evening, whether that is go train at the gym three, four, five times a week, whatever it is  just that intentionality of writing it down and putting it on the calendar, even the intentionality of everyone listening and saying,  what are the four things that i want to accomplish every week? i want to call my mom or dad  i want to train  i want to, whatever  i want to read a book for 10 minutes  ''ramit sethi  and then putting those down on your calendar  it doesn t matter if it s in the morning or night, whatever works for you  that instantly separates you from being opt in, from being buffeted by the winds left and right and just going wherever the world takes you  you decide  don t let the world decide for you  hear, hear  ramit sethi, sethi  how do you say your name correctly?''ramit sethi  ramit sethi  okay  so you have second edition of i will teach you to be rich available  and i m sure by the time people hear this, it may be available   it should be available and has 80 new pages of material ''ramit sethi  yeah  tools, insights about money, and psychology  stories of readers who ve used the book  the scripts that we were talking about ''ramit sethi  yeah  and oh, yeah, look at that ''ramit sethi  look at those  real reader results ''ramit sethi  yeah  and we re looking at a copy of the book right now ''ramit sethi  i wanted to show people that rich   a lot of people think rich looks a certain way  but i wanted to put photos of these readers  men, women, black, white, young, old  every one of us has someone we want to see ourselves represented  mm hmm (affirmative) ''ramit sethi  you know, i saw an ad on the train for an indian dad in hindi  and i was like,  you know what? 10 years ago, that wouldn t have been meaningful to me, but now i m actually appreciating being represented  ''so that s what i wanted in this book  and you ve tabbed a couple of things for me to check out later, which i will check out  i m just going to read the tabs  we don t have to go through all of them  stories, next  victim culture, which i m sure you re a huge fan of  i m kidding  word for word scripts  ignore reddit  invisible scripts  crypto love and money  so you got a lot here ''ramit sethi  yeah  and as i mentioned earlier, i m just going to read the first paragraph on the back of the book  cause i haven t seen this in ages  just quick, quick backstory note, i remember when you were writing this ''ramit sethi  dude, i came to you for advice  and i gave you   do you remember the book i gave you?''ramit sethi  bird by bird  bird by bird by anne lamott ''ramit sethi  yeah  but here s the first paragraph of the back copy,  buy as many lattes as you want  ''that s a reference to people who recommend you cut back on all these things like  ''ramit sethi  yeah  a latte   spend extravagantly on the things you love  live your rich life instead of tracking every last expense  ''and what i ve always enjoyed observing and learning from, are the tests that you do  you experiment ''ramit sethi  yeah  you actually implement these things and you provide scripts and actual algorithms for achieving very specific results ''so, awesome to see you ''ramit sethi  thank you dude  it s been a pleasure  i love catching up and thanks for having me on  yeah  people can find you on twitter  instagram  and website iwt com  are there any other places where people can check you out?

1,2,2: Josh Waitzkin ,"   so josh, i figure we might as well start at the top and do a little retrospective of what led you initially to write the art of learning  of course, that's how i was, in many ways introduced to your work, and then through our mutual friend, max, ended up connecting  but what was the reason you decided to write that book?  josh waitzkin  i initially started thinking about the idea of the book about two years into my martial arts lessons  so i transitioned from chess into studying, into meditating and into studying east asian philosophy  then i started to get into tai chi chuan and ultimately into the martial application of push hands and i started to experience this very interesting transition from the principles  my level just began to translate directly over into the martial arts  i think it was primarily one experience i had that was something around two years into my tai chi training  i was giving a simultaneous chess exhibition in memphis, tennessee at a fundraiser for my school district and i was 45 or 50 boards at once  i was walking down the middle of this big square of chess tables  everyone's playing one game  i'm playing each of them, and about 40 minutes into the simul i had this experience that was so interesting  i began to feel like i was riding the energetic wave of the game, like i was in push hands training  i wasn't playing chess  i wasn't thinking in chess language  i wasn't calculating variations  i was feeling the flow  feeling my space out behind, like i would in the martial arts and i had this realization  i was playing beautiful chess, but i wasn't consciously playing chess, that the barriers between these two different arts had dissolved in the mind and that's when i started to conceive of the idea of the book  a lot of the process i spent five years taking notes and i had 400 or 500 pages of notes before i actually sat down and wrote it  a lot of that process was deconstructing what i'd been doing rather intuitively  so essentially, what it felt like before this translation along parallel learning, which is two rather abstract terms, that's the language that i was using internally when i was first thinking about the book  as if i were just taking the essence of one art and translating it over into another and the process of writing it involved deconstructing what i'd been doing, somewhat abstractly into something that could be replicated more systematically   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   so the question that jumps out in my mind, which is a bit of a side perhaps, but in simuls, playing your 10, 20, 30, 40 boards simultaneously    i'm trying to ask a better question than how does someone do that  but at what point what happens to a chess player when they go from an inability to play multiple boards simultaneously to being able to play multiple boards simultaneously? what is the framework or thinking or experience that someone builds up that allows them to do something like that? which to the average person seems like a rain man like feat?  josh waitzkin  i think it's different for every chess player  one of the beautiful things about chess is that you can approach it in so many different ways and to be worldclass what you need to do essentially is express the core of your being through the art  i think that's true of many arts and that's probably something that we'll get into more deeply  so you can have a very mathematical person who plays chess mathematically  you can have a very musical person who plays chess musically  someone might be much more kinesthetic, like myself and it's sort of a feeling for flow and hidden harmonies, and almost a physically energetic relationship to chess  when i first learned to play chess, when i was six years old in washington square park, it was a battle  i loved the feeling of going into a fight with someone and finding these hidden harmonies and finding where these animal passions mixed with this technical complexity, and much later when i'd gotten much better playing simuls, it was a higher level manifestation of that same dynamic  for me, playing simuls is something akin to juggling a lot of balls and i wasn't playing 40 different games for example separately  the flow of all 40 games would coalesce into one larger sense of flow and it was actually really interesting  often when i'd give a simul and there'd be a youth competition the winners of the youth competition would play against me, so sometimes kids would cheat  they'd really want to beat me, so they would cheat  so i'd be walking around this big thing, and then i'd get to the table, and they'd have shifted their positions to try to win because if they could win it would be a big thing  and my experience when that happened was as if you had    imagine if you had 40 balls up in the air and suddenly they all crash onto the floor  i would know that they would change their position  not by reaching the board nor remembering what the position was and then seeing it changed  it would initially be this feeling of the energetic flow had been interrupted and then i'd have to reverse engineer myself back to that one game  that one component of the flow and then i'd remember the game  and then i would remember exactly what position it had been and then i'd say ""haha, this is the position "" copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    then it would take me two or three times going back around to get all the balls back up in the air and get back to that energetic flow  so actually, for me, giving simuls felt similar to playing one chess game, but that was my own relationship to it  i think that probably if you ask ten different very strong chess players they'd all give somewhat different answers  tim ferriss   got it  do you know what blew me away was spending time with a friend of yours,  maurice , when we went to washington square park and seeing him play a game at least for the first portion without looking at the board  i won't give away too much of the punchline, since we captured it all on a film, but it was pretty amazing  but his ability to track the board it seemed like by chunking portions of the board into larger gestalt pieces    i don't know if that's the best way to express it    but it seemed like his ability to seemingly remember all these disparate pieces was because he had the board broken down into component chunks, as it were  i don't want to take us too down that fine line  let's shift gears  what i'd be very curious to know at this point because i know, of course, a little bit of the background, but i want to dig into the details  what type of people do you personally work with these days and why do they work with you? what type of things do you do with them?  josh waitzkin  i have three major dimensions to my creative life right now  what made a fourth and i guess the most important one is my son, jack  he's a little over two yearsold and the love of my life  so that's maybe the most important part of my life, no question about it  i run a nonprofit educational foundation and we have our own jw foundation, the art of learning project, and we have a couple hundred programs in schools around the country, internationally as well  so this is integrating these principles that we have been developing in schools working with teachers, parents, and children around this individualized and thematic relationship to learning that i've been developing  so there's one dimension  the other one is i own a martial arts school, a brazilian jiu jitsu school with marcelo garcia, who is the nine time world champion  you know him well, tim  he's really the michael jordon of the grappling world  so there are world class athletes training there  then i run a consulting business where i'm training people who are at the cutting edge of the finance worlds and this is really interesting work  because we're focusing on that last 1 or  1  of the learning process, which is really my specialty  it's highly individualized  it's cutting edge work on their learning process, their idea generation, their creativity, their performance psychology, and their resilience  fascinating work and what i've discovered it's interesting because i copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    wrote this book called the art of learning years ago, and so people are always coming to me to speak about learning  but much of what i've been focused on in recent years has been unlearning  when i think about that last movement the equivalent, say number ten to number one in the world, to number five to being number one in the world, it's much more about finding subtle obstructions  finding friction points and releasing them, identifying cognitive biases blocking your way  it's the movement towards unobstructed self expression  if you think about your creative process as a hose with a big crimp in it, if you release it, just unbelievable pressure can be released  and a lot of what i'm doing with people is trying to move them from very good to great or from great to truly elite, deeply individualized work  i'm helping them really find ways to express the core of their being through their art, which is as you know a big theme in my life from when i played chess at my highest level  that's what i was doing when i had a period of being really locked up in my chess career which we can go into in more detail if you want  i was doing the opposite  i was trying to fit in someone else's mold and then ultimately when i transitioned away from chess into the martial arts i returned to that experience of self expression  and that's when i really started to understand that very deeply  i think it was the crisis towards the end of my chess career which really laid the foundation for the work that i do today with brilliant  inaudible  who are just trying to make that movement to the equivalent world champion  tim ferriss   to jump actually back to marcelo for a second, because i've of course met marcelo and he's just     josh waitzkin  you mean you've gone to war with him, man  i've watched you  tim ferriss   i've gone to war with him, which if there's anything at stake, i don't recommend   josh waitzkin  he's a tough guy  he's caused me a lot of pain over the years  tim ferriss   he's a tough guy, but also a sweetheart of a guy  he's so fluid  what i'd love to hear from you, of course, because in the art of learning, which some people might be familiar with, they read about your experiences in chess, your experiences in tai chi and the parallels between them  and this overarching framework for optimizing mental and physical performance, if that's a fair way to put it, which is the art of learning through these different techniques and strategies  what have you learned through this third art of brazilian jiu jitsu?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    what are some insights or strategies that you've had since moving from tai chi, which is some ways similar, but also very different from brazilian jiu jitsu which a lot of people will be familiar with, through the ufc and mixed martial arts? josh waitzkin  all right, i mean the pertinent context relevant to my life  so the art of learning ends with the 2004 world championship  it ends describing a narrative of that  it was just an absolutely harrowing and crazy experience  i won't give the punchline, but it was really intense  and after this i had decided i wanted to be a beginner again, to put on a white belt literally and figuratively and so i took on this third major mountain in my life, brazilian jiu jitsu  i was training out on the west coast for about a year when i was actually writing the art of learning  i was training brazilian jiu jitsu twice a day  this was after i'd spent five years taking notes  then i had a 2004 world's  then i was writing it  i started training with john machado out there  then i came back to new york  i started training with mark  mosantos  here, and i started to develop this relationship with marcelo, who is just the greatest grappler to ever live, and we were doing private lessons  we developed a friendship  then he moved to florida and i would travel to florida to work with him  and ultimately i made the decision that i wanted to bring him to new york  mostly because i was at that point planning to make a run for the world championship in this art, and there was no better to do it than to get my ass kicked by the very best to ever live in the sport  he's just a wonderful guy and he's just unbelievable martial artist and so we opened up the school together and i've done the mats with him other than when one of us has been injured  there have been a lot of injuries in these sports, all the time  and it's been a fascinating experience  marcelo is so profoundly different from me  i'm a really conceptual guy and i think abstractly, of course, with my foundation in chess  marcelo is one of the most kinesthetically overdeveloped persons i've ever met and of course, overdevelopment and underdevelopment tend to come hand and hand conceptually  josh waitzkin  can you give me an example of that? what would be an example? tim ferriss   of overdevelopment underdevelopment?  josh waitzkin   of kinesthetic, what it means to be kinesthetically     tim ferriss   his physical intelligence is mind boggling  when he'd come fishing with me i'd throw him on stand up paddle board in three foot chop and everyone just flies off of paddle boards when they stand up on them  and he was just beautiful   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    he'd find the balance points  i've never seen someone learn so quickly how to handle waves, boats, handling fishing lines, free diving, riding waves on paddle boards  i've been a stand up fighter for many years, as strong as my core art when i'm doing standup training with marcelo i caught him with most of the throws in my repertoire one time  i don't think i've ever caught him with a throw twice, which is amazing  i was world class where i'd catch them thousands of times  you almost never see marcelo get caught more than once with something  it's amazing to see how he relates to the world through his kinesthetic intelligence  for example, when we were looking for spaces for our school we'd walk into a big room and i'd be thinking about the dimensions, square footage, where this would be, where that would be  marcelo would know if it felt good or felt bad  he's going to know whether he feels good about you or he feels bad about you and his intuition is incredibly dead on  but he navigates the world through this kinesthetic intelligence and it's been really fascinating having the school with him and diving deep with him  because we've been having conceptual dialog for these three and a half years or so and he's really deep conceptually  but i've learned even more deeply the importance of the lesson that there are many paths to greatness  and to take a guy like marcelo and to try to fit him into a chess player's hyper conceptual mold would be terrible  and he's so great because of his just unbelievable commitment to doing it his way and he's done things in extraordinary ways  for example, you know how in these competitive arts everyone's very secret about their repertoires? we have this program, which you know well called mg action, where people, jiu jitsu guys from around the world login to watch all of marcelo's shows, training sessions, his sparring sessions, his lessons, everything  when he was competing in abu dubai is when he got the world championship and when  inaudible  which is the brazilian jiu jitsu world championship we were streaming his sparring sessions every night  so he was visually showing these competitors what he was about to use against them at two weeks, three weeks, at four weeks, and his attitude about this was just completely unique  ""if you're studying my game, you're entering my game and i'll be better at it than you "" so simple, so pure, and if you think about it, it's really deep  the opposite of what most chess players would do and most jiu jitsu guys would do  so he's wide open to constant learning  the other beautiful thing about marcelo is people call him the king of scrambles and if you watch his training style, he's always in transition which is a really interesting idea to think about in a disciplinary manner  because most people get their egos involved in their training and they're trying to dominate all the time, and to dominate in almost anything, you find that there's no dominance copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and you keep it  but marcelo always lets the opponents move and so he's constantly playing in transition  and so if you think about what world class martial arts means and you brought, for example, maurice ashley and you're playing chess in washington square, it's similar  if you're at a much higher level than someone you can always seem mystical because you're doing things which are outside of their conceptual scheme  the way that operates in the martial arts is if you think about it through the lens of frames, if you and i are looking at a position and in your mind, there's this position, this position, and this position so there are three positions  in my mind if i'm constantly training at the transitions between these positions, these actually expand into these transitional frames and become positions to me  so if i'm seeing 100 positions when you're seeing two, then i can play in your blind spots and i can seem mystical to you because you haven't trained there  and that's what marcelo does by spending all of his time in transition, he has cultivated the art to play in the in between, which is really what level is all about or one of the core things that world class martial arts is all about, playing in transition, in gaps in your opponents  fight pattern  tim ferriss   observing and practicing with marcelo say on the  inaudible  team or the marcelo team just blew me away  because if you look at it as an uninformed spectator or even a moderately informed spectator you're blown away by how fast he is and how effective he is  but the nuance of eliciting movement, allowing space to open, manufacturing space by applying pressure, and then leaving it is so subtle and so incredibly effective  then you start to notice these principles that carry over to many, many hundreds of possible positions, let's just say  it's really amazing  it reminds me of something i heard once from a musician  i don't know who the original quote is from, but he said that ""music is the space between the notes "" and i was like, ""huh, that's a really interesting way to look at it "" but what were you going to say?  josh waitzkin   i was going to say i think that's a gorgeous quote  most great arts are defined by that space in between   tim ferriss   yeah, it's like writing  writing's the same way, right? it's like when in doubt, leave it out   josh waitzkin  beautiful, and of course, the thing about marcelo is that it can often seem initially that he's moving so fast  but what's incredible he can also move very slow and do things that you don't see  so the great sleight of hand is practicing the art of illusion when we're not practicing   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    it's amazing what can be done with intention, with controlling someone's intention  this is a lot of my training in push hands related to finding ways to essentially control someone's intention so that you are ahead of them, even if they were ultimately moving first  you were there before they arrived  it's a fascinating psychological component of really high level training in anything  tim ferriss   i remember an interview with one of the k1 fighters back in the day and they were talking about peter aerts  i don't know if you remember the dutch lumberjack, huge guy and he seemed fast and i remember what people said  a number of opponents said, ""he's actually not that fast  he's kind of a big lumbering guy, but he's so good at predicting timing that he sees you telegraph before you even have the thought to throw the punch  and he beats you to the punch as a result of that  but it's because he picks up on the cues faster than other people "" i thought that was very interesting  to try to bridge this to something else, you work with    of course i'm not going to mention names    but you work with some of the most stunningly successful and famous traders and people in finance  i mean some real masters of the universe type folks  what have you found unique about that group of people? let's just start with that  i'm curious to know what you've noticed being as observant as you are, about that group of folks   josh waitzkin  that's a big question  tim ferriss   it is a big question   josh waitzkin  first of all, i think a core principle to start with is that there are many paths to greatness  each one of these guys who's really world class is doing it his way and he's harnessing his eccentricities  he's cultivating his or her strengths as a way of life  there's not an excessive focus on weakness  there's just an embracing of deep, deep studying of the preconditions to someone's finest moments to expression and then they build their lifestyles around it  that's a lot of what i do is help people understand what makes them tick on a very, very deep level, relative to the cognitive biases, where they're locked up and where to  inaudible  come  what kind of external conditions, what kind of internal conditions  the ones who are really at the top are people who have mastered this art of deep introspection and taking the result of these introspective processes and turn them into training systems and into a way of life  it's fascinating how the process works  what i do with these guys is after i do my initial diagnostic process, i have ways of revamping their daily architecture, the way they live their life  so that they're, for example, aligning their peak  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    energy periods with their peak creativity work  they're building lifestyles that are relentlessly proactive as opposed to reacting to inputs  they're building a daily architecture which is based on maximizing their creative process  if you think about this    to most people a simple case in point is email checking  most people when they finish a break, even top guys in industries when they finish a break, when they wake up first thing in the morning what do most people do? they check their email  when they come from a workout they check their email  when they come back from lunch what do they do? they check their email  so what you see is whenever they're coming back from something after a break, they're soaking in inputs  so they live this reactive lifestyle  their creative processes are dominated by external noise as opposed to internal music  and a lot of what i work on with guys is creating rhythms in their life that really are based on feeding the unconscious mind, which is the wellspring of creativity information and then tapping it  so for example, ending the workday with high quality focus on a certain area of complexity where you can use an insight and then waking up first thing in the morning creating input and applying your mind to it, journaling on it  not so much to do a big brainstorm, but to tap what you've been working on unconsciously overnight  which of course, is a principle that hemingway wrote about when he spoke about the two core principles in his creative writing process, number one ending the workday with something left to write and  tim ferriss   yeah, often in mid sentence even   josh waitzkin  right  so not doing everything he had to do  which most people do, but they feel this sense of guilt if they're not working  you and i have discussed this at length, but leaving something left to write and then the second principle, release your mind from it  don't think about it all night  really let go  have a glass of wine  then wake up first thing in the morning and reapply your mind to it  and it's amazing because you're basically feeding the mind complexity and then tapping that complexity or tapping what you've done with it  this rhythm, the large variation of it is overnight, and then you can have microbursts of it throughout the day  before workouts pose a question, do a workout, release your mind after workout, return to it, and do creative bursts  before you go to the bathroom, before you go to lunch, before anything  and in that way you're systematically training yourself to generate the crystallization experience, that ah ha moment that can happen once a month or once a year  a lot of what i do is work on systems to help it happen once a day or four times a day, and when we're talking about guys who run financial groups of  20 to  30 copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    billion, for example, if they have a huge insight that can have unbelievable value  if you can really train people to get systematic about nurturing their creative process, it's unbelievable what can happen and most of that work relates to getting out of your own way  it's unloading  it's the constant practice of subtraction, reducing friction  tim ferriss   what would be an example? you've mentioned cognitive biases a few times  for those people who may not be familiar with that term what would be an example of cognitive biases and how someone might work on them?  josh waitzkin  right  well, there are a lot of cognitive biases that are specific to certain disciplines, like chess or finance or philosophy  but if we think about it in terms of everyday life, let's say we make a decision and we then feel the need to justify that decision, and so we make more decisions to justify that initial decision  then we basically get ourselves into this deep wormhole which is caused by the attempt to justify  tim ferriss   like sunk cost fallacy   josh waitzkin  exactly, so in the financial group in the world talking about it these will be sunk cost fallacy, you're right  but it's very interesting for example, for a chess player who makes a certain decision and there's a certain emotional and intellectual and time component to the value we put into the thought process behind that decision  and what we often have to do is release it because the position changes shape  a very interesting way that it's manifested in chess, which you can think about rather universally, is that's there's a certain evaluation to the position  you and i are playing, tim, and i have a slight advantage in the position  i'm nurturing that advantage  i'm nurturing  i'm nurturing it and a lot of complexity and i make a slight error and suddenly your position is equalized, right? so if i'm holding on to the past evaluation emotionally where i had the advantage, then what i'm going to do very subtly, i'm going to reject positions that don't give me that advantage  but if objectively i no longer have an advantage, then i'm going to be reaching too far  then i'm going to be rejecting the notion of accept which will make my position slip more and more and more and you fall into what i call a downward spiral  so this relates to a lack of presence which really connects to a cognitive bias, an addiction to a past evaluation as opposed to a present one  so that's a very simple example of a cognitive bias  a mental addiction, a thought construct, something that we hold to be true because of some complicated twist in our mind that's no longer actually true  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and so of course, a very simple antidote to most of this is presence  if we can look at a moment or a chess position or an investment decision or any decision with very clean presence, outside of emotional inertia, then we can often slice through just amazing amounts of fat with very, very simple decisions or if you think about the learning process, for example  this is one thing i love about your approach to learning, the language that you and i use is    i call you a master of deconstruction  you look at the way people approach different sports and you find the biases, the false constructs and you find the way to learn a very straight path to learning as opposed to people getting mired in all sorts of tangled webs of complexity which are essentially caused by cognitive biases  isn't that how you'd put it? tim ferriss   no, i think that's true and i obviously appreciate the kind words  i think you and i have very complimentary approaches and like you've said before, i tend to focus on the 80 20 analysis as it applies to people getting up and off the ground as quickly as possible to stay in the top 5 10  of the general population  where what's so cool about our conversations, what i enjoy so much in part, is that you're really focusing on that final leap  how do you go from being great to being the best? they're very complimentary skill sets  what i'm looking at is a way to unearth cognitive biases and just as a side note for people who want to look into this you can go to wikipedia and search cognitive biases and there's a long list which is pretty fun to read  there are a number of books about these types of things too  think twice i think is another one  the question that i ask myself    and i'm always interested in the questions that people ask themselves, because i find to my mind that that internal dialog is what defines your day to day thinking and what you think you become  so it's so critical that you ask yourself the right questions, and in my mind, or i should say rather when i'm trying to deconstruct say a sport, all i'll ask is to start with what rules are people following that are not required? so outside of the law and science and even within science and within law reality is negotiable  so a good instance of that is the high jump, and the fosbury flops  dick fosbury who's really the first guy to go backwards over the high jump, and up to that point there'd been straddle kicks and all sorts of different approaches, and he was ridiculed at first and then he was called a cheat because he won the gold medal and now everybody uses that approach  so having a list of questions, who's good at this? who shouldn't be, is another one that i love to ask because you might know someone  for instance, you were talking about the different styles in chess or jiu jitsu, where in chess, as in a  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    reference to your first book, you have attacking chess players  then you have very different stylistic differences and you've got very quantitative players  and for the tv show, for the tim ferriss experiment i did an episode on poker, and i've avoided poker my whole life because i viewed it as a game of chance  and i had a former computer science guy who said, ""no, no, no i'm not going to teach you to be lucky because i can't teach you to be lucky  but i can teach you to run some probabilities and only bet when you have a good likelihood of a positive outcome "" what was so fascinating is you look at a guy like that and you'll find a highly quantitative    say hedge fund managers for instance, or investors of different types, tech investors who go to the world series of poker and they run the numbers  that's how they play  and then are other guys who are completely seemingly fly by the seat of their pants  they're very kinesthetic  they're playing an intimidation game  they're very physical  so asking myself for instance, who's good at this, who shouldn't be? if the assumption is you have to be very good at math to be good at poker  who admits to using no math which might be misinformation and let me look into how they do it  then the second question is how have they replicated their results? are there other people they've taught to do what they do to try to separate out the nature from the nurture where possible? but i want to come back to the finance guys, just for a second, and to ask you about rituals and routines  then i'm going to ask you about your own  but what are some habits and it doesn't have to be across the board with all these guys because they have such different personalities and approaches  but with some of these really super high level finance guys who are managing tens of billions of dollars what are some of the habits that you've observed that you find interesting or rituals? josh waitzkin  for me, it's like describing the keystone habits that i recommend for people to internalize in the field?  inaudible   tim ferriss   yeah   josh waitzkin  first of all, meditation  where we're speaking about this theme of cognitive biases or basically observing your mental dictions the moment that they set in  meditation is as deep and as powerful a tool as i could possibly describe  maybe six or seven years ago when i was first talking about meditation with guys in the finance world it seemed like some woo woo strange thing for them to take on  but as more and more people are integrating in their process, you wouldn't believe how many of the most powerful players in the world are meditating very deeply   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    it's just an amazing way of deepening the creative process, deepening presence, expanding your energetic relationship with the world, gaining insight, and realizing that most of the thinking that we do basically springs from mental addiction  and much of people's lives are spent in an emotional swirl which is a reactive one  and having a relationship to presence which allows you to see through the illusion of that emotional swirl or of those mental addictions, meditation is an incredibly powerful tool, which i know you know quite deeply  i've been meditating since i was 17 or 18 years old  it's a big part of your life as well, tim  so that's a very, very important habit  the idea of waking first thing in the morning and turning your mind to creative work, pre input as opposed to checking email and getting reactive, opening up your channels to the unconscious mind first thing when you wake up in the morning, and doing the same, ending the workday with quality, hugely important  i remember when i went skiing with billy kidd who is one of the great downhill racers from back in the '60s olympic ski team  he's an awesome dude  now he skis out in colorado wearing a cowboy hat, just a timeless guy, brilliant dude  and he was saying to me years ago when i first skied with him, ""josh, what do you think are the three most important turns of the ski run?"" i've asked that question to a lot of people since  and most people will say the middle because it's the hardest, the beginning to get up momentum really describes the three most important turns of a ski run are the last three before you got in the lift and it's a very, very subtle point  for those of you who are skiers, that's when the slope is leveled off, there's less challenge  most people are very sloppy  then they're taking away a lot of the muscle they've been using  they have bad form  the problem is that on the lift ride up unconsciously you're internalizing bad body mechanics  as billy points out, if your last three turns are precise, then what you're internalizing on the lift ride up is precision  so i carry this on to the guys who i train in the finance world, for example  ending the workday with very high quality which opens up, for one thing, you're internalizing quality overnight  we're nurturing themes as well as skills  it's one thing to learn skills but the higher artist has to learn themes or metathemes that will ultimately, spontaneously taps into the internalization of hundreds of what i would call local habits  if you're practicing quality, you're deepening the muscle of quality and you're also focusing the unconscious in that complexity which we then tap first thing in the mornings  this is a core habit, journaling, certain post mortem processes, ending your day with a reflection of the quality of the work, where the core is, complexity that you're wrestling with, hugely important   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   would you do that immediately after the end of the workday per se, before bed? how do you time that if someone wanted to try these themselves?  josh waitzkin  i find at the end of the workday the problem with doing these things right before is then you're sort of consciously going to bed thinking about these things  that's why i find you want to release  the very core idea is when you go home, as best you can, unless you're red hot inspired release your mind from the work  it's very important to give your stress a recovery  core habit, you want to be turning it on and turning it off  and you can teach people that turning it off is a huge part of teaching them to turn it on much more intensely  stress and recovery workouts, interval training, and meditation together are beautiful habits to develop to cultivate the art of turning it on and turning it off  so if you're undulating your heart rate, for example, between 170 172 174, and say 144, the practice of lowering your heart rate over the course of 45 seconds is akin to falling asleep, releasing your tension  and then as you're pushing your heart rate back up, you're letting it turn on  so you're using a physical metaphor to train at the art of turning on incredible intellectual energy and then turning it off  marcelo garcia, who we were talking about, one of my most beautiful memories of him in the world championship right before going to the semifinals,  inaudible  this bleacher  everyone's screaming and yelling  he's sleeping, asleep on the bleacher, can't wake him up  he took a stumble into the ring  you've never seen a guy more relaxed before going into a world championship fight, and then he can turn it off so deeply, and man, when he goes in the ring you can't turn it on with any more intent than he can  and his ability to turn it off indirectly aligned with how intensely he can turn it on, so training people to do this, have stress and recovery, undulation throughout their day  and then thematically this ties into again, this internal proactive orientation, building a daily architecture which is around understanding your creative process as opposed to reacting to things, feeling guilty that you're not working, really teaching people to tap into their internal compass  so those are some of the core themes that i would bring up first  i could spend three hours talking about this subject  tim ferriss   let's do it  we'll have a part 2  the meditation i wanted to touch on for a second, as you know i've been taking that very seriously for particularly the last six months or so  and i received an email the other day from the teacher that i used for a transcendental meditation and there are many different types of meditation  i'm curious  i'm going to ask you about how you format your own meditating in a second  but in many types i have my issues, my likes, and dislikes as it relates to almost all of them   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    but i received an email with a link to an article, and the title is ""bridgewater founder dalio credits transcendental meditation for his success "" and for those who don't know he's the founder of the world's largest hedge fund, bridgewater associates  they have what,  100 billion plus under management i think  and his quote is, ""meditation more than any other factor has been the secret to whatever success i've had "" that is a helluva endorsement  so for me, it's been getting over that resistance to what i perceived as a woowoo new age type thing and the ability to view it almost as just a warm bath for the mind, a warm taking of a mini vacation from my own brain in a way  which may or may not    depending on who you ask    be the most helpful way to look at it, but i found that a very useful lens through which to view it  if there is a particular type of meditation you follow what is it? how do you personally meditate? what do you think of or not think of? how long do you do it, etc ? josh waitzkin  when i was 17 18, i started studying very simple, contemplative, acquiescent buddhist sitting meditation where i'd focus on my breath and this is when i was late teenager  then i started getting involved with tai chi and i started studying east asian philosophy very deeply  and this is where i got increasingly into moving meditation, which is the most deep practice or the practice that i've personally done most deeply  tai chi for meditation so that the meditative form of tai chi is the essence of the art and then the fighting application was what i was competing in  and so i spent many years meditating four, five, six hours a day with tai chi  today i combine my tai chi practice with sitting meditation again  most people when they enter meditation what i suggest they just practice very simple sitting meditation following their breath  it's a practice that doesn't have to be very complex  they can for example, just sit cross legged or comfortably in a chair and follow their breath and it's very interesting  because they'll notice after one or two seconds that their mind starts racing off and usually what happens when you have really driven guys who are trying to meditate for the first time and their mind races off, they get all pissed off  ah, angry, frustration, they feel like they're failing at meditation  and one of the most important things to do is to embrace the fact that meditation isn't about perfection  it's about the return to breath so when you find your mind racing, you observe that, and you return to your breath and that's a tough emotional hurdle for a lot of guys  it's very interesting because over time, you know the metaphor of basically the mind is a wild stallion that over time you're taming and ultimately learn to still it  it's racing  it's bucking  it's pulling against any kind of line you put on it  but ultimately the circles get smaller and smaller and you learn to observe when copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    your mind is getting caught up in some kind of mental or emotional addiction more and more quickly and fluidly  and the return to breath becomes easier and easier and it's very interesting  by the way as a competitor because i relate to the theme of channeling the emotion or fear whatever's rising as a world class competitor in the same way we might speak about meditation  i spoke at a conference on grit recently and it was very interesting for me because for the most part  tim ferriss   grit, g r i t?  josh waitzkin  g r i t, yeah, which is a first core educational principle in a lot of charter schools these days  it's hugely important, teaching kids to be resilient  it's very interesting because when i hear people speak about resilience    and this is we're moving a little bit aside from meditation, but we'll bring it back  the focus is on, for example, overcoming difficulty, suffering, learning to basically push through  what people don't realize is that world class performers what they've done is they've reoriented their relation to the suffering to the point of resistance  they've learned to embrace it  they've learned to see the beauty in these moments where there's pain because that's incredible room for growth  i think that a lot of what you learn to do in meditation is observe the addictive you might be defining something and if you want to you can simply alter that definition, so you can change your relationship to pain, or the rain, or a huge storm, or fear, or anger  so for example, people from the outside will use the term fearlessness  but if you speak to any great soldier or seal team member or fighter, or ufc guy, mixed martial arts, a great world class fighter, they'll tell you that they feel fear  they just know how to sit with their fear and how to work with it, channel it  so the idea of fearlessness is a false idea which is imposed from the outside by a spectator  and when you observe world class performers what they've learned how to do is harness fear, nerves, anxiety, bring them in, embrace them, have a working relationship with them, and channel them into intensity, and meditation is an incredible form or vehicle  you can do this because you learn to observe where you have addictive relationships and you realize they're not absolute  and you can actually transform your relationship to any of these thought patterns, thought constructs, cognitive biases, or emotional patterns  tim ferriss   yeah, i was looking at a quote as you mentioned that because i wanted to get it right, but it's one of my favorite quotes from cus d'amato who trained boxers like floyd patterson, jose torres, most famously perhaps, mike tyson and he would say, ""the hero and the coward both feel the same thing, but the hero uses  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    his fear, projects it onto his opponent while the coward runs  it's the same thing fear, but it's what you do with it that matters "" i started meditating and gave up meditating many, many times because i had the response that you mentioned about type a personalities  i'd be sitting there and i though the objective was to quiet my mind and i'll come back to that in a second  so when i failed at quieting my mind because it would be ticking off the to do list or being like, ""oh, that fucker who said a, b, and c to me the other day "" i would harp on these ridiculous things and i'd get then pissed  and i'd get pissed that i was getting pissed and get up and have a coffee and storm out of the house which didn't seem like a productive meditation session  i actually started doing it consistently when i kept it really short  a friend of mine recommended this where i would number one, be comfortable  so i would sit down, but to avoid back pain i would actually lean against a wall which is very commonly thought of as a big no no, so i'd lean against a wall to keep my back straight  i would listen to one music track  i would listen to one song every morning, the same songs as a cue and would pay attention to my breath and focus on being an observer of my thoughts, but not trying to control them at all  so if all i did was think about my to do list the entire time, that's fine, as long as i'm paying attention to my breath  that non attachment to an outcome i e  controlling my thoughts was very helpful  and the format that i followed subsequent to that we can have a longer conversation about why it finally clicked, but the short answer's accountability  i had a teacher who was going to give me a hard time if i didn't do my meditating and then report back  it was 10 to 20 minutes twice a day  what i found was by allowing the thoughts to occur and not judging myself  because let's say i'm thinking about email or the grocery shopping i need to do   just letting that happen but getting good at observing it, i was able to then have more emotional awareness later which would prevent cognitive biases and bad judgments  so what i mean by that is as a concrete example, i'm an impatient guy  i always have been ever since i was literally a little kid, like 12 or 13 years old  if i was at the restaurant with my mom and dad and the server didn't come over and pour water after we'd been gone dry for five minutes, i'd get up and walk into the kitchen and grab a pitcher and walk out  i'm really impatient and i get angry  i get angry about things that i view as deliberately slow and sloppy and that anger can be harnessed sometimes into really productive aggression  but it also wears you down at both ends  so what i found is after meditating consistently for even a week or so, when that anger would start, i was better copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    observing tim, as a third person  like, ""oh, look at that, tim's getting angry about something really small and stupid "" as opposed to simply becoming angry, and then causing problems for myself, whether it's just internal or interacting with other people  so i agree with you completely on the meditation  josh waitzkin  i love that image of you as a 12 year old racing into the kitchen bringing out the water  that's a great metaphor for your life today  you'd race in there and you'd get the water and you slice right through them  i love it  tim ferriss   so let's do a couple rapid fire questions that are all tied into this stuff, but we can just do short questions with a couple of short answers  complete the following statement, ""my favorite time of day is blank ""  josh waitzkin  my favorite time of day is holding my son in my arms after i've woken up with a 20 30 minute journaling session  i get my son  i bring him downstairs and i give him his bottle of milk and i hold him and i look at him in the eye and i tell him how proud i am of him  we talk about what he's thinking about and what he's working on when he has some milk  i think it's the most magical part of my day, these days  tim ferriss   that's in the morning?  josh waitzkin  yeah, i wake up about a half an hour before him  i do a big creative burst  as a parent your sleep patterns change pretty dramatically, but i've found this rhythm where i wake up where i do that burst and then i just love that first morning energy time with him  and we have this deep connection while he's having his milk and talk about things  tim ferriss   what time do you wake up?  josh waitzkin  i usually wake up around 7 05 and he's usually awake around 7 30 7 35  tim ferriss   i'm endlessly fascinated by morning routines so this might seem really digging, like i'm digging into the minutiae  but when you wake up it sounds like you wake up and you have 30 minutes to journal before bringing your son downstairs  do you brush your teeth, drink a cup of coffee, any of that before you journal or do you just roll out of bed, walk into the office, and sit down to write   josh waitzkin  my routine is that i roll out of bed  i brush my teeth  i go downstairs and i sit down with my journal and i start writing and i immediately apply myself to a reflection that i have targeted in my mind in the evening or late afternoon before and i just let it rip  i have a big creative surge  then once i hear my son i go get him and then i have my breakfast usually a bowl of oatmeal after he has his milk and then i have a cup of coffee about a half an hour after that   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   cool  related to you strike me as a happy guy  obviously we all have our challenges then and again, like the place i'm getting remodeled at the moment which i won't go into a diatribe at the moment  i'm very excited about it  it's my 12 year old, tim, wanted to go get the water pitcher that's not being very helpful right now  what are three things, could be two, three things that you believe you need in order to be happy? that could be for you  it could be for people in general  i m just curious how you would think of that or answer that question   josh waitzkin  one of the great things about you and i being different and having a conversation is that you tend to be very good at picking up bullets and lists of three things and that's not how my brain works  i can tell you the essence of how i relate to that question  i'm not going to give you the three bullet answer because that's just not how this brain operates  i have built a lifestyle being around true to myself  maybe a big reason is because of my mom used to always tell me as a kid to follow my heart, follow my dreams  i never made decisions for money or for external things  i always trusted that if i was true to myself, these things would follow  and so my professional life, my foundation, my school, i only work with people who i feel are ethically aligned, who have a good energy, who i feel really good about intuitively  i keep empty space in my life  i rarely have more than one or two meetings a day  my life is about quality and not quantity and it's about depth and not breadth  my businesses are based on doing very, very deep and very excellent work with just a handful of people  and so i really like to cultivate quality as a way of life and i believe that when you're not cultivating quality, you're essentially cultivating sloppiness  so the idea of building the musculature of quality and being like a heat seeking missile, i take great pleasure in observing the beauty of the little moments in life  so for me, my lifestyle is based on working out every day  i just focus on structuring a day that will allow for my creative process to be rich  i'm present with my son  i have my office is at home  i'm with him in the morning  i'm with him and see him throughout the day  i'm with him and give him his bath and read him a story at night with him  i've eliminated almost all travel that takes me away from my boy  going to conference my wife, and my baby are coming with me  i really build a life around being true and i don't build it around anything material  that's really the essence of how i personally relate to this question  of course, there are different solutions for everybody, but this works for me  tim ferriss   this is something that is being true to one's self, i think that most people struggle with  i think it's a goal that most people have at least in the abstract, but  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    i'd love to dig into some concrete details of that and perhaps you could share an example of something you've changed  like maybe where you got slightly off the path and made a correction to be true to yourself and what that looked like  josh waitzkin  well, for me, a very clear example is my public life  i was a young kid, fell in love with chess  i won my first national championship when i was late eight, early nine  when i was 11, a book came out, searching for bobby fischer, and then when i was 15, the movie came about my life based on the same book that my dad initially wrote  so i was really thrust into the spotlight, without me wanting to  i was just a young passionate artist  i loved playing chess and competing in chess  i was put out there and i had paparazzi following me everywhere  i was really living in the spotlight in a way i wasn't necessarily emotionally prepared for  i felt in my teens how that challenged my love for this art because my love for it was so pure initially  that tension that fight to stay true to my art taught me some very deep lessons  after i finished high school i took off and i left the country, largely to study chess very deeply undistracted from publicity  i moved to eastern europe  my girlfriend at the time was from slovenia  no one knew me out there and it was a beautiful life  i just left the public world, and since then when i came back, i've had these periods where i've been exposed to publicity  and i've been in periods where i've been deep in a cave and moved away from it  i think this is a very clean example  other than you, very few people drag me out  inaudible   tim ferriss   throw a net over the bear and drag him out of the cave   josh waitzkin  you have a way of doing that to me, but in a beautiful way  i've found that the privacy of my life, not doing things, not getting caught up in the swirl of fame, or seeking external adulation is a very important thing for me, personally  everyone's different  but for me, maybe i have a little bit of oversensitivity to this because of my youth, because i was out there so intensely as a young guy  i think it really challenged my love for the game  there's an example of the kind of decisions that i'll make and i think it's very important for me to live the vast majority of my life privately  i don't do very much that will allow me to be recognized on the street and live my life as a celebrity because i've gone down that path and i love my privacy  i also built a career around my businesses, working with people who are similar, who are not seeking the limelight  we're not out there on television every day  we're world class, but no one around them other than people very close have any idea that they have been so incredibly successful in a monetary way  they copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    try to raise their kids not to be spoiled  the kids are gritty kids  they're great philanthropists, really good people  and i love, i'm very drawn to people who have been enormously successful, but don't get caught up in the external crap that comes with success and are real, who are living their life tapped into the love  that's how i try to live  tim ferriss   what are the books    let's just stick with books for a second    that you've either most gifted to other or most recommended to other people  because there are many people listening to this probably who won't necessarily have the opportunity to interact with the types of high level folks that you and i are so fortunate to have a chance to interact with  but they can do that vis   vis, books, or narratives, documentaries, etc  what are some books that have a formative impact on you?  josh waitzkin  so if we go back to when i was 17 18, jack kerouac has a huge impact on my life, on the road, dharma bums  his books were initially tapped me into the idea that life could be ecstatically beautiful  then i moved into studying taoism, so lao tzu, the tao te ching, hugely just unbelievable deep  but of course the translation of that book that you read will be formative and my favorite translation is the gia fu feng in the english translation of the tao te ching  zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance, i think one of the most important books ever written by robert pirsig who has become a very dear friend over the years  when the art of learning came out, my publisher asked me, ""who would you love to read this book?"" and i said, ""well, the one person i'd really want to read that book is robert pirsig "" he lived a deeply secluded life, but they somehow managed to get him a copy of the book  he got it in a big bushel from his publisher and he read it and contacted me and wrote  i was so honored that he was moved by it and he and i over the years have developed really interesting dialog  zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance is one of the most important books in the world to focus on quality than inequality, learning to find art in anything, deeply, deeply brilliant, philosophical book  shantaram, one of the most beautiful novels i ever read by gregory david roberts, is one i've gotten to know very well, just an ecstatically beautiful book  of course, i'm also a lover of fiction  i mean hemingway has been    he's probably the most important writer of my life  tim ferriss   any particular novel stand out for you of his?  josh waitzkin  i think that for whom the bell tolls is just an exquisite novel, the green hills of africa, amazing  his short stories are utterly magnificent  i think we have the green hills of africa is one of the most underrated books that he's written  his copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    complete collection of short stories, there's one magnificent gem after the next  of course, old man and the sea is the one everybody thinks about and it's a beautiful book  i guess if i had to have a favorite it would be for whom the bell tolls  tim ferriss   yeah, for those people who are listening you also want insight into his writing style, a moveable feast   josh waitzkin  it's a magnificent book, yeah  tim ferriss   yeah, also   josh waitzkin  that's where hemingway really speaks to his writing process, it's fantastical  tim ferriss   yeah, it's so fascinating   josh waitzkin  you know there's a great book by the way, tim, i think you've read which i think it's hemingway on writing  have you read this book? tim ferriss   i did read it, yeah  i also read that   josh waitzkin  ah, if someone wants to get to know hemingway it's just a fantastic compilation of all of hemingway's writing in letters, in his books, in his articles, everywhere, put together thematically  basically hemingway on the writing process, i think it's one of the most important little collections on creativity that i've ever run into  absolutely brilliant book  josh waitzkin  and it's really short  i remember i read it on kindle on a short flight that i had and just jammed right through the whole thing  one of the recommendations was write drunk, edit sober and i realized that write drunk, edit sober does not translate to podcasts very well  the last podcast that i did with a buddy, kevin rose, if you record drunk and try to edit sober it doesn't really actually work the same way  tim ferriss   that's interesting  let's do a couple more questions because this has been fun  if you had to run out of your house and just take a handful of things with you, obviously your family is safe, so that's accounted for  what would you take and why?  josh waitzkin  in what kind of situation? like in a very dangerous situation? tim ferriss   you don't have to fend for yourself with weaponry or create fire with flint or anything like that  there's a fire in your house, so you just have to get out to the street and then you'll obviously sort things out later  but assuming your family is safe what would you take with you, just what you can carry basically?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    josh waitzkin  that's a really great question  i actually had that experience years ago when i was playing chess and it speaks to how crazy i was  i was studying chess with this brilliant russian grandmaster name yuri averbakh  who i actually wrote about in my book  i was on the fifth floor of a walkup  it was an old one bedroom  i had my first apartment and we were deep, deep into chess study and there was a huge fire  and i looked out and there were five fire engines and dudes screaming at us and we had to go out the fire escape  and i ended up going back in and grabbing my computer with all of my chess notes  it was just a random thing to do  it was so unimportant  it speaks to how different i ve become and it had been seconds from being up drafted, blowing the whole building up  yeah, so i wouldn't do that  i don't know, man  honestly when you asked me that question now if i think that my family was safe, i have nothing material that i would grab  tim ferriss   that's great  that's a very stoic response in the most positive way  all right, my man  i'm going to ask you one more and i'll give you the choice of two questions  let's do that  so the first option is what did you want to be when you grew up, so when you're a kid and now how would you answer the question? what do you want to be when you grow up? that's question number one  question number two is if you had a committee of three people living or dead to help you make decisions, who would you choose and why?  josh waitzkin  these are great questions, man  tim ferriss   thanks and, by the way, i'm borrowing them really from every good interviewer i've ever come in contact with   josh waitzkin  do you want me to answer both of them or do you want to answer one of them? tim ferriss   you can answer them both   josh waitzkin  these are two very different questions  i mean this is tough, man  tim ferriss   yeah, and if they    i'm just trying to be respectful of your time, but if you have time, and you have some thoughts on both, let's go for it   josh waitzkin  when i grew up when i was a kid i wanted to be a professional baseball player  i loved something about the sport  i spent a lot of my life as a competitive from age basically six until 35 i was basically a professional competitor in my field  but my mom always said to me that she felt like that was a phase and that i was a healer  that was always her language  and a lot of what i do today is try to figure out how to help people to express themselves in as pure a way as possible  artistically in a way that gives them joy  i think that my plan is sometime in the next four or five years    i'm 37 copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    now  i'm thinking about it when i'm 40 41  i guess that would be three, four years now  i'm getting old  to turn my mind to taking everything i've been doing in these different laboratories and apply it to a world changing education initiative  helping children fulfill themselves in a very deep way i think is an essential calling  i'm not going to say it's my end game, but that's the next major chapter i think of my life that i'm building towards  i'm laying my foundation for many years now and we do beautiful work, but i have an allergy to scaling if it's going to dilute quality in any way  so i've been sort of building up the groundwork to ultimately be able to do something hugely important in education, so i think that that's going to be the core of how i would    i'm building towards that in a few years  in terms of the committee of three people  tim ferriss   just to interject for a second  that's also i think my calling, and of course, we've spoken at length about this  so if you need co conspirator, count me in for that one   josh waitzkin  yeah, dude  let's plan on this  let's say four or five  we have to figure what it's going to be made  four or five years we'll team up and we'll take the world by storm in education  inaudible   tim ferriss   sounds like a plan, man   josh waitzkin  all right  i love it  it caps that movement away from self  as a competitor you're fighting in many ways there's something about the focus inward on one's self and becoming a parent i've definitely felt this movement away from it  my son is    just my love for me so transcends anything i ever felt before  it's been really important to experience  when you become a dad, man, then we're going to have some fun  tim ferriss   i can't wait   josh waitzkin  looking forward to your sleepless nights  tim ferriss   oh, man  yeah, you're going to see battle weary timbo  i need to work on my polyphasic sleep  is there a committee of three people? what are your thoughts?  josh waitzkin  well, one person who would be on that committee is someone who i know a very deep friend of mine who happens to be in the finance world  his name is dave  i can't speak about what his last name is, but just a deeply meditative spirit, great wisdom  as an insightful human being that i've ever known in my life  i think that that he would definitely be on that list  can we say outrageous characters like gandhi? copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   yeah, go for it, yeah   josh waitzkin  i think of gandhi, lao tzu, and buddha  if you need to be at certain    i don't know, man  i don't know if i can answer this question very intelligently  tim ferriss   that's a perfect way to end   josh waitzkin  yeah, i don't know and tim, of course, you man you give me so much crap in life  i'd call up you because you'd definitely be one to slice through all the nonsense, yeah  and my mom, that's the most important one, my mom  she has given me the most deep advice in my life  i mean mom is the one person who has really embraced these crazy decisions that i've made when i left arts when i was one of the tops of those fields because of some strange calling i had inside  i think you can be at top  inaudible   she's my hero  my mom's the greatest person i've known  tim ferriss   awesome, man  well, this has been a lot of fun  obviously, we're going to have a lot more conversations  is there anything you want to    any parting thoughts, advice, suggestions, anything like that that you'd like to impart? if not, we can call it a day  but the mic is yours if you have anything that you'd like to add   josh waitzkin  no, i love this  this has been really interesting  i guess if i'm going to close with a thought it would be that one thing that i've been doing in the last year since writing the art of learning is i've been exposed to the most brilliant thinkers in these fields  i've studied the patterns behind them and i've studied the people who study them  and one of the things we have to be wary of in life is studying the people who study the artists as opposed to the artist himself  pirsig, the author who i mentioned, he uses a great term  the philosophers and philosophologists, the philosophogists are the ones who are basically philosophizing about the philosophers as opposed to do doing philosophy  and the vast majority of philosophers today actually are just philosophologists  similarly you and i have discussed there's the writers and there's a literary critic  there's the artist and the art critic and i think we have to be very careful when we study excellence and we're thinking about our path to excellence  that we're studying and we're tuning in to the direct experience of people who have actually been there as opposed to the armchair professors who are talking about it  because if we spend our life in the trenches and we spend our life studying that last  1  of the learning process, what we see is that that final passage to excellence is really about navigating that razor's edge where you have to be willing to go right up against a potential enormous blunder  you have to improvise, for example, trust your intuition in moments where all the objective, mathematical faculties you've developed are telling you copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    something else, but your intuition is operating a higher level  you have to really be willing to go up to the brink of disaster to succeed in moments where you're, for example, fighting in the finals of the world championship or in the very last seconds of the super bowl or nba finals  and in navigating these things, the armchair professors will often have the exact opposite of good advice  and so what i would say for one thing, listen deeply, internally to the core of your being and build your game plan from there  trust your gut and then build the lifestyle around listening to that and cultivate the love  and that's the other thing i'd say  whether you're talking about the beginning of the learning process or the very final surge or surges, think about the love  think about parenting, cultivating resilience, cultivating excellence, cultivating creativity  what the armchair professors all forget about is the love and that's what i see consistently with people who've found the most pleasure, the most happiness and created the greatest art is that they have a profound passion for what they do  not only the big moments, but the little moments  the moments that others would call pain  they learn to love practice  they learn to love the point of resistance  don't forget about the love  i guess what that's what i meant to say  tim ferriss   that's a beautiful way to end this, man  well, josh, i am sure we'll be talking  next time we'll have some wine and     josh waitzkin  we're good to go  tim ferriss   yeah, i hope everybody checks out obviously the art of learning and really keeps an eye on what you have coming when you decide to push stuff out of the cave   josh waitzkin  thanks, brother  this was a lot of fun  i enjoyed it  tim ferriss   all right, buddy  i'll talk to you soon   copyright   2007

140,148,148: Josh Waitzkin ,"   zdravstvuj, my cute little darlings  this is tim ferriss and welcome to another episode of the tim ferriss show where, each episode, it is my job to deconstruct world class performers from many different worlds   whether they come from military, entertainment, sports, or otherwise  to dissect and collect the patterns for you that you can use  to tease out the routines, habits, thought processes, etc  that you can apply immediately and test in your own life  and this episode is a really fun one  ever since episode 2 of the podcast   we're probably around 140 or 150 now   you've been asking for a round 2, a follow up, with josh waitzkin and this is it  josh waitzkin was the basis for the book and movie ""searching for bobby fisher "" he is considered a chess prodigy, although we'll discuss why that term doesn't necessarily apply to him because he has perfected learning strategies that can be applied to anything including his love of brazilian jiu jitsu   he has a black belt under the phenom of ninetime world champion marcela garcia   or tai chi push hands   he's world champion  these days, he's spends his time coaching the world's top performers whether mark messier, cal ripken, jr , or investors whose names you'd recognize or whose assets under management would blow your mind  and, as contacts, i initially met josh through his incredible book, ""the art of learning,"" which i loved so much that i helped produce the audio book  you can find that as part of my book club on audible com timsbooks  and this episode is deep  josh is always deep and he walks the talk in the best way possible  i hope it will blow your mind  we talk about achieving flow states, neardeath experiences, use of slackline, training elite performers, cultivating sensitivity   and i don't mean that in the most boo hoo way imaginable but, rather, the most practical way imaginable use heartrate variability training, high intensity interval training, breath awareness, etc    intuition and its applications to investing, and it just goes on, and on, and on  so please enjoy my conversation with josh waitzkin    intro music   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   joshua   josh waitzkin   yes, timbo?  tim ferriss   welcome back, buddy  i am so happy to be here    josh waitzkin   i'm thrilled you're here, man   tim ferriss     hanging with you  and i thought we could maybe start with a complete nonsequitor which is a book that you just mentioned to me   that i know nothing about   which is ""dreaming yourself awake "" can you talk about this?  josh waitzkin   oh, i didn't think we were going to begin here  it's a book that i explored a couple years ago  about 20 years ago, i started studying tibetan dream yoga and lucid dreaming   not deeply, but exploring  and this was during the period when i was first getting involved with my study of east asian philosophy  and then a dear friend of mine recommended this book  it's actually funny because we made a mistake together  i recommended another book but he texted back confirming that it was the name  he texted me back that name that i didn't intend but then i picked up and read and it was extraordinary  it's just a phenomenal discussion, very systematic discussion of the art of lucid dreaming in this way that fuses east asian philosophy with western science   tim ferriss   and you were competing, then, at the time or were you not competing? you were in the midst of competition?  josh waitzkin   two years ago, you mean?  tim ferriss   oh, this was two years ago?  josh waitzkin   yeah, this was two years ago    crosstalk  tim ferriss   oh, i thought you said about 20 years ago  sorry   josh waitzkin   20 years ago is when i started studying east asian philosophy   tim ferriss   i got it   josh waitzkin   and i was competing in chess, then, and martial arts   tim ferriss   yeah, i need a little more caffeine  working on it   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    josh waitzkin   you've had a rough night   tim ferriss   and i want to thank you   and this is tim's stream of consciousness podcast intro   we're looking at a slackline  this is an indoor gibbon classic slack  it's about 12   no, not even   10 feet long, maybe  it's surrounded by kettlebells an indo board and a triceratops   which i don't think is yours   josh waitzkin   you've got the bosu ball there   tim ferriss   and the bosu ball  and i wanted to thank you for actually getting me to bite the bullet and grab a slackline which is set up on long island   josh waitzkin   yeah, absolutely  i've had some fun on your slackline on long island, too  right now, i'm in the period in that i oscillate between these  and my son, jack, who's four and a half, we have a great time  i'm on the indo board rocking it, he's on the bosu ball, we have to catch back and forth while on these things  we're always integrating these interesting kind of physiological awareness training   tim ferriss   speaking of which, i feel like maybe we should throw a cautionary tale into this fall podcast  so we obviously trade stories and findings all the time  would you like to talk about your recent experience with wim hof and breathing training?  josh waitzkin   wow  yeah  i had an extremely scary experience  so i'm a lifetime meditator and experimental subject, like yourself, around all these things   tim ferriss   you tend to have better self preservation instincts   josh waitzkin   i tend to, although i've had a lot of close calls in life  well, when i heard you speak to wim, i was extremely intrigued  in fact, when i heard someone mention wim to you on your podcast   and then we spoke about it and then you spoke to wim   i thought, ""he sounds like a fascinating guy "" i started digging into his work  he's so powerful and i started going through his online course  i loved it  the energetic feeling, the electric surging through the body  i'm also a lifetime freediver   since i was four or five years old, i've been freediving   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   and, just to put that in perspective, you spend about a month a year in the water   josh waitzkin   yeah  it used to be three months when i was younger  now, it's about   yeah, free diving, usually about a month of the year  but i spend a lot of time now, as we know, sento paddle surfing, swimming, diving  the ocean's a huge part of our life  we're got to talk about our sento paddle adventures soon, man, because those are pretty hilarious   tim ferriss   we'll definitely come to that   josh waitzkin   timbo and i have been having some fun with that  but i started playing with the wim hof method and i thought it was incredibly powerful  the intensity that you're experiencing internally   it's very similar to training in tai chi twan, movement meditation, for 10, 20 years and then, being an hour long into a session and you have this feeling of energetic flow inside your body  with wim hof, you do a few rounds of his breath method and you're experiencing these things and it was incredible  the gain and strength were mindboggling  the length of the breath holds were fascinating  but then i made a big technical error  i ignored all the signs on wim's site that you spoke about   do not do this in water   which were all over the place  but i thought, ""free diving's a way of life for me  no problem "" and the major technical error was not realizing   which is absurd after a lifetime of free diving   that it's carbon dioxide buildup which gives you the urge to breathe and not oxygen deprivation  hugely important thing   please, everyone, burn that in   it's co2 buildup that makes you want to breathe  and so i did, after a long swim at the nyu pool a few months ago, i started doing my wim breathing and did a series of underwater swims  i did about eight 25 meter swims  and i think i was on my fourth 50, underwater   and this was after a long workout   and i went from this ecstatic state to unconsciousness  and i was actually on the bottom of the pool after blacking out from shallow water blackout for three minutes before someone pulled me out  and the doctors have told me usually it's 40 seconds to a minute to perhaps permanent brain damage, death  i got very lucky  my body saved my life  and they said that if it hadn't been for all the training that i've done for so many years, i would have been gone   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   and, more specifically, you   correct me if i'm wrong   you didn't   and this strikes me as so odd   you didn't have the reflexive inhalation of water, is that right? you didn't take it in    crosstalk  josh waitzkin   yeah, i didn't take any water into my lungs, which is hugely fortunate because fresh water in the lungs can be terrible  so my lungs had no water in them, pretty much  after they pulled me out, i was unconscious for 25 minutes  i started breathing on my own, though, when i came to 25 minutes later  and i was blue everywhere else  my body sent all the blood to my brain and my heart  it saved my life and i'm here  but it was a life changer, on a lot of levels  the idea of my four year old boy, four blocks away, sitting on the rug waiting for daddy to come home and me unconscious on the bottom of a pool, blue, just that's the kind of experience that is shattering   tim ferriss   how did that change how you think about training and these types of experiments or life, in general? i know that's a very broad question but    josh waitzkin   i've been    tim ferriss   how does it change your decision making, i guess?  josh waitzkin   yeah  well, first of all, how it's influenced my life, in general, is i've never lived with such a consistent sense of gratitude, beauty, and love in my life  it's just flowing through my body   presence to the exquisite little ripples in everything i do   and a sense of gratitude for the little things  it sounds clich  but it's embodied and i really feel it and that's something i'm really grateful for  it's exquisite  my little boy   my wife is pregnant, we have another son coming in june   and it's made me rethink these questions of risk  but, on the other hand, it's very important not to oversteer  the most important learning lessons that i've learned for myself in training elite mental performers is that people oversteer all the time  they overcalibrate  and so i've been very careful to sit with this and try to draw the right lessons out of it and not the wrong, and not too big of lesson, and not too small of lesson  so, for example, this was a huge technical oversight i had  i didn't realize i was taking a big risk, here  i've had a lot of big risks that i've taken  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    in my life   some with you   and i think i'm actually pretty good at navigating those but i've been thinking about them quite a bit   crosstalk  tim ferriss   and you're cognizant of the level of danger and the risk    crosstalk  josh waitzkin   right  but, of course, it's very important for me to be cognizant in a group risk  as we've discussed, it's important to be present to your own level and the level of everyone else around you  we can get into some of those   tim ferriss   yeah, we'll get into that   josh waitzkin   but i've been really sitting with this  since i was a really young boy   i started playing chess when i was six years old and, by the time i was seven, i was the top ranked player in the country so i had all this pressure on me   and a big part of the way that i found   my therapy was flow   tim ferriss   can you explain that?  josh waitzkin   yeah  when i was under huge pressure, external pressure for this little boy, my style of chess play was to create chaos  i love the game  i love the battle of chess   tim ferriss   attacking chess   josh waitzkin   right  attacking chess  and most players, when they have a lot of pressure on them   in the scholastic chess world, for example, and it's true in many fields   they learn how to memorize their way to victory  and they find shortcuts to getting good, fast, and controlling the game all the way  they think about rating points, they think about rankings, they think about winning  they have parental pressures, they have school pressures, they have, sometimes, publicity pressures if they're doing well  so they want to control their way  i had a different approach  i like to mix it up  i grew up playing in washington square park with the hustlers who taught me to battle  it fit my personality  and it was a core part of my competitive style to create chaos and find hidden harmonies, and find flow in chaos  and, as i've reflected on this in recent years, a big part of how i've  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    dealt with stresses has been to put myself into a flow state  and this is an element of risk that i've been thinking about  it's different when you're 20, and 25, and 30 years old as a professional competitor or professional fighter  and then now i'm 39 years old  a dad   which is the most important thing i've ever done in my life, being a father  i'm so committed to it  so i have to be quite cognizant of the distinction, for example between risk competitively and risk mortally  when you're playing chess, it feels like life and death  it really does feel like life and death  when you lose a chess game, you feel like you've been shattered on the most fundamental level  and i was quite comfortable mixing it up   profoundly creating chaos   and i'd be willing to take those risks  but, actually, it's isn't life and death  and then, when you're a professional fighter, martial artist, you can break arms and legs in a second if you're not in deep focus or you could break your neck  but, again, the stakes are it's you out there  and then, when you're a dad, it's a little bit different when you're surfing, or you're rock climbing, or whatever extreme state  so it's very important for me to be clear about the distinction between what felt like life and death as a chess player and what actually is life and death today   crosstalk  tim ferriss   metaphorical and literal states   josh waitzkin   right  and then there's the state of being someone who's found deep flow as the ultimate therapy   tim ferriss   there are a number of different questions i want to ask related to everything you just said  the first is how do you initiate or facilitate a flow state and how would you describe it? maybe we can hit that first   josh waitzkin   well, i've had a lot of different ways of playing this  i can describe it in terms of myself and then we can go into, when i train people, how i work with them   tim ferriss   great   josh waitzkin   for me, love has been a huge part of flow  i fell in love with chess and found flow in the self expression through an art form that i absolutely loved  and i think this is really important with children, to find something that they feel just connected to and that they can  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    express themselves to  they can bring out the essence of their being through some art  and then it was tremendous competitive intensity and, of course, stretching yourself to your limit, it's a very important precursor to flow  and i was always playing with people who were at my level or above and so i was always stretched  and then i was integrating, in my teenage years, integrating meditation into my practice so i got very good at increasing my sematic awareness, my physiological introspective sensitivity, being able to feel the subtle ripples of quality in my process  i could feel when i moved from a 9 or a 10 out of 10 back down to a 9 or an 8  tim ferriss   you're talking about in the meditation itself?  josh waitzkin   no, i'm talking about through my meditation practice   tim ferriss   you became more tactile sensitive when doing push hands or some other type of practice?  josh waitzkin   chess, initially, and then into push hands   tim ferriss   why is the tactile position important in chess?  josh waitzkin   well, i think it's hugely important in mental disciplines  so, for example, in chess and a lot of what i do today is have this laboratory of training elite mental performers   largely in finance investors   and a huge part of the training is in their physiological and perspective sensitivity  that's their sematic awareness  that's the foundational training  why? well, first of all, we can't just separate our minds and our body   tim ferriss   totally  a cartesian duality mix   josh waitzkin   right  this is your way of life, as well  but we intuitively can feel things way before we are consciously aware of them  the chess player always senses danger before he sees it, just like the hunter will sense the shark or the jaguar before  he'll look for it  so the chess player's process is often to be studying a position to be able to sense opportunity or danger and then to start looking for it, deconstruct what it is, and then find what it probably is and then start calculating  but that sense comes before  or, if you're a great decision maker or if you're an investor, you can sense danger, you can sense opportunity  but you need to have stilled your waters internally to feel the subtle changes inside of you that would be  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    opportunity or the crystallization of complex ideas, or danger   or the onset of a cognitive bias, for example, which is hugely important as a chess player, or as an investor, or as anything else  this is one of the areas where i   we've had this ongoing dialogue in our friendship around what i call ""armchair professor "" tim ferriss   philosophologist   josh waitzkin   right  philosophologist  yes  so a philosophologist is a term of robert pirsig, the author of ""zen   the art of motorcycle maintenance,"" is one of my favorite books, and thinkers, and friend of mine  the difference between the philosopher and the philosophologist is what tim is referring to   or the writer and the literary critic, or the man and the arena and the armchair professor   tim ferriss   or remy from ""ratatouille"" and anton ego, who's the food guy    crosstalk  josh waitzkin   okay, i don't know that one   tim ferriss   he's the food critic   josh waitzkin   okay  yeah   tim ferriss   there it is  okay, good   josh waitzkin   yes, there it is  and so, when we think about, for example, cognitive biases   the academics who study cognitive biases who speak about them     crosstalk  tim ferriss   and just for people who have context on cognitive biases, for example, the sunken cost fallacy   josh waitzkin   yes   tim ferriss   ""i've spent this amount  therefore, i should put good money after bad because i feel like i need to somehow try to salvage this money that i've put into a given position ""  josh waitzkin   right   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   i just wanted to give people who   who  ? we've had a number of meals with him  there's a gent   ""think twice "" the author's name, again, do you recall? mauboussin?  josh waitzkin   yup  michael mauboussin is who you're thinking about   tim ferriss   mauboussin  there we are, for people interested   josh waitzkin   yup  and so, one of the interesting things about the academic dialogue of cognitive biases is that there is the idea that the biases have to operate completely separately from the intuitive processes  as if we have an intuitive process and then we have to go through a checklist of cognitive biases  in my experience, really high level thinkers have integrated cognitive biases   or awareness of cognitive biases   into their intuitive processes  so there's this constant process   we discussed this a couple years ago, actually   where you're deconstructing technical awareness into something that   so this process, for example, of building a pyramid of knowledge   we have a certain technical foundation, we have a high level intuitive leap, we can then deconstruct the intuitive leap into something that we can understand technically and replicate technically  and then we're raising our foundation up higher and higher level of intuitive leaps  this is this pyramid of knowledge which, in my process, is built upon by   the intuitive leaps are what's guiding it  similarly, we can learn how to take tactile material and integrate it into our intuitive understanding  but we aren't going to intuit the cognitive bias  we're going to intuit the feeling     crosstalk  tim ferriss   that corresponds   josh waitzkin   that corresponds with the bias being present  and so we think,   with this relative to the language, again, of robert pirsig   i like the language of dynamic versus static quality  if you think of a timeline in a competitive state   for example, in a chess game, there's a certain objective truth to a chess position  if you think of chess as a timeline which is moving, if you think about pirsig's term of being at the front of the train of reality   the freight train is pushing through   dynamic qualities right at the front of that freight train  think about that as a timeline   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and then the other is the chess player's mind studying the position  when the chess player is present to the position, it's continuing  you're just running parallel to the truth of the position and the quality of the position  but if, let's say the something changes  you make a slight mistake  you move from having a slight advantage to slight disadvantage but you're emotionally still connected or attached to having the slight advantage  then what's going to happen is that you are stopping   your dynamic quality is becoming static but the game's continuing  but what's going to happen then is that you're going to suddenly reject positions that you should accept, and you're going to stretch for positions   for valuations   that you can't really reach, and you're going to fall into a downward spiral  so that's the onset of a cognitive bias  in that case, the cognitive bias would relate to the emotional clinging of past evaluation  tim ferriss   but, if you had the present state awareness which you had trained through different tools and approaches   which you use with these elite performers, for instance   you would have the sense, the feeling, of that cognitive dissonance and not get caught up in the slip stream of that dislocation   josh waitzkin   exactly  and the way that you would sense that, in this case, is that you would feel the slip away from dynamic quality  and so you would deconstruct that feeling and then you would see what the bias is that's setting it  so this is really important to say  it's not that we're going to intuitively develop the ability to know exactly what bias might be setting in at the moment but we're going to cultivate the ability to have presence  i think about it as a cultivating qualities way of life   cultivating presence as a way of life  in little moments and small   when we're holding our babies, when we're reading a book, when we're having a conversation with a friends, when we're meditating    tim ferriss   how do you help people to identify what that feeling   to become more sensitized to it? and just as a, maybe   not a counter example   but an example of not listening to that intuition and instinct, so we were both in costa rica, recently, doing paddle boarding    crosstalk  josh waitzkin   great story    crosstalk   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   last meal of the trip, we go out to celebrate  we go to this seafood restaurant  food comes out   it's a sunday   and i leaned over the plate and smelled the food and immediately knew that it was something i shouldn't eat  and despite that   everybody's ordering drinks, everybody's celebrating   went into the food  and about a third of the way through, i stopped and i just pushed the plate away  and then, lo and behold, everybody gets severe, severe food poisoning except for the two people who   i guess we tried to narrow it down to whether it was the garlic dip or any number of other things  but, yeah, we were on the toilet every five minutes for the next 12 hours, minimum   josh waitzkin   and the great part of it is you and i, we're in adjoining bedrooms and we're sharing the same toilet so that was a hell of a night   tim ferriss   and we never saw each other  it was amazing   josh waitzkin   but i heard the flushing happening  we were taking turns  that was a brutal experience  i remember the look   watching you sniffing  you had this expression of concern come over you at the dinner table and i saw that moment  maybe i wasn't present enough to you and you didn't   it's a great example of you didn't fully trust your gut but you were right on  it was amazing   tim ferriss   or i felt a social pressure to conform and not rock the boat  so how do you help someone, say, in the world of investing, just as an example, not only develop the sensitivity to separate that signal from the noise but also to actually listen to it? yeah   josh waitzkin   these are two different points   tim ferriss   right   josh waitzkin   so let's talk about developing and then let's talk about listening to it because they're both so hugely important  and i'd frame them both thematically in different ways  and i'd build training systems around them both that would be quite different  so when we're thinking about cultivating the awareness, i think that a lot of this relates to a return to a more natural state  this isn't so much about learning as unlearning   tim ferriss   agreed   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    josh waitzkin   yeah  getting out of our own way   releasing obstructions  i think about the training process as the move into an unobstructed selfexpression  obstructiveness   we have so many habits that are fundamentally blocking us  phone addictions   people are constantly distracted  people don't have the ability to sit in an empty space anymore  people are bombarded by inputs all the time  they're in a constantly reactive state  so one way that you could frame this out is cultivating a way of life which is fundamentally proactive in little things and big and you can build daily architectures that are fundamentally productive  but then getting into the weeds a little bit more, i think it's most foundational to develop a mindfulness practice   to cultivate the ability to sense the most subtle ripples of human experience  now i've been trying to on board people, specifically, in the finance space, for example, into meditation for a bit over eight years now  initially, i would just try to get guys to meditate and they'd look at me like i was crazy  then i what i realized   i had this breakthrough   was that i realized if i had them start doing stress and recovery interval training, then when   so oscillating heartrate between 170s and 140s, say   so let's say someone does an 8 or 10 minute warmup and then they're on heartrate interval doing some kind of cardio   bike or whatever   moving their heartrate up and down between 170s and 140s  when they become aware of the quality of their focus on their breath on their recovery intervals, enhancing their abilities to lower their heartrate more quickly, and they start to feel their heartrate   listen to it   when that awareness would kick in, i'd layer in meditation  and the on ramp was just much more successful  people would just   and then what i started to refine that way was biofeedback  so now what i'll do is i'll have them do the stress and recovery interval training and then i'll have them do some form of biofeedback   often with, for example, heartrate variability  we do heart math working with a specialist  and then, when they begin to have a certain consistency of their ability to enhance their emotional regulation, to observe these subtle ripples between stress and coherence   and you can see their biometric data   then you layer in meditation and then the on ramp is even more powerful  and so then they're in a meditation practice  i think headspace is a wonderful tool for layering in meditation    crosstalk   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   i agree  and i think, for a lot of people, starting with a headspace before bed is another gateway drug approach to then building into, or leading into, the morning meditation which a lot of people have trouble with because they wake up feeling rushed  it's another thing to layer in on top of the brushing the teeth and getting the kids ready, etc  so sometimes the evening approach   but i agree that headspace is really useful   josh waitzkin   i think you're absolutely right there and i think it's really important to have a core meditation practice which is, at least in the beginning, in the conditions in your life that are most conducive to deep focus and to not being distracted  later in life, we want to be able to tap our meditation under complete   in chaos but we want to cultivate that, initially, in the most peaceful time possible  so, if you have kids, waking up before the kids are up or in the evening once they're asleep  or if you don't have kids, then life is much simpler   tim ferriss   yeah  or during your commute  i've found a lot of people who will just throw on headspace or some song that they meditate to when they know they have 20 minutes on the subway  and it's like, ""alright  that's my 20 minutes ""  josh waitzkin   right  yeah  i enjoy meditating on the commute a lot, personally  you've been meditating for a long time  i'm not sure how you feel about this but i find that, if people can have the first two, three months of meditation practice in a quiet room, then, if they start doing it in their commute, they've built the foundation of it in this quiet space   tim ferriss   i think that, from what i can tell, it appears to depend a lot on what type of concentrator you are  and what i mean by that is, if you look at writers, for instance, there's some writers who want to be in a quiet environment in order to hear whatever the muse is whispering  and they'll go to a library, they'll go to someplace like that  i can't do that  for whatever reason, i thrive in noisy environments because if i have the noise, i feel like it forces me to focus inward  so, for me, studying languages even, in a loud environment, writing in a loud environment, for whatever reason, is a forcing function for me  but i can definitely see why, for even perhaps the majority of people, it would be   i think it's partially due to the fact, for instance, i'm looking at your wall right now and the fact  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    that that picture is tilted five degrees to the right is making me totally bonkers  josh waitzkin   should we fix it?  tim ferriss   no  it's just training for me to look at that the rest of the time we're talking    crosstalk  but the same is true auditorily  so if i have a controlled noise   like music or the chug a chug a of the car in the subway   i can focus on that repetitive noise  but if i'm sitting in a space what i want to be quiet  and i have that controlling aspect of my personality trying to impose itself on something i can't control   and then there's somebody hitting reverse in a truck and i can hear that outside, it will drive me nuts  long observation to a short comment but i do think that, if you can drop in in a quiet environment, the point being, as you said, to stack the deck in the beginning  josh waitzkin   yeah   tim ferriss   learn how to do this in a controlled, unstressful environment and then you can ratchet up over time to when you can use it in the most stressful of environments   josh waitzkin   right, because we don't ultimately want to be meditating in a flower garden  we want to be able to meditate and have a meditative state throughout our lives   in a hurricane, in a thunderstorm, when sharks are attacking you   any moment because that's    tim ferriss   when you're paddle boarding the last day on a first trip and josh is like, ""you'll be fine,"" and then three leashes snap and all hell breaks loose      josh waitzkin   that's a long story   tim ferriss   and a killer set comes in   josh waitzkin   so that's just a little context here  timbo and i have been on this great adventure of stand up paddle surfing   taking it on together   and we've got a great friend down in costa rica, eric antonson,  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    who actually has the other podcast   other than you   who i listen to, paddlewoo  tim ferriss   paddlewoo, yeah   josh waitzkin   paddlewoo  eric's awesome  he's a great dude  he runs the blue zone sup  he's a brilliant teacher   really fascinating mind deconstructing stand up paddle surfing on increasingly small boards  and we've been going out there  and we've had some hilarious close calls  our last trip, a couple weeks ago, we almost destroyed each other   tim ferriss   yeah, we had   there was this one witching hour where the juju was really weird  almost everybody almost got decapitated, impaled by a board, or just head on jousting collision which is what    josh waitzkin   but the point that you brought up, i think is right on about meditation   that, when you're building training programs for elite mental performers, the most important thing is to understand them so deeply and build programs that are unique to their funk  embrace their funk   that's a term my buddy, graham   who's a dear friend of ours who comes on our surf adventures with us   he's a brilliant thought partner   tim ferriss   embrace the funk  could you explain that?  josh waitzkin   yeah  we have to embrace our funk  we have to figure out   you think about the entanglement of genius and madness   our brilliance and eccentricity  understanding that entanglement is always a precursor to working with anybody who's trying to be world class at something because the entanglement is fundamental to their being  and they have to, ultimately, embrace their funk, embrace their eccentricity, embrace what makes them different, and then build on it  and when we think about self expression, it's not trying to take everyone and put them into the same mold, it's trying to understand someone deeply and build a training program   a way of life   that helps them bring out the essence of their being through their art, whatever their art is  that's how i relate to the path to excellence   in chess, in martial arts, in different arts, and very actively in the investing space, in my work in education with children through my non profit   it's again the movement to unobstruct self expression  but the problem is the teachers don't listen  they don't know how to listen  they don't know how to   or parents   to sit in an empty space and  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    observe the nuance of their child's mind or their student's mind and then build a way of life around that  people are used to teaching the way they learned  think about martial arts instructors   almost all of them trained a certain way and then teach that way, which alienates 65, 70 percent of the students by definition  it's very rare that you have someone who can take the time to   and it takes a lot of time to know someone deeply enough to build a training program and a way of life around who they are  for me, i only work with 8 teams and i don't take on new clients   very seldom do i take on new clients   and i won't work with more people  tim ferriss   you also don't do a lot of pr  for everybody listening, i always get these emails and texts that are like, ""hey, could you intro me to josh  i want him on my show,"" and i'm like, ""he's not going to do it ""  josh waitzkin   tim, you're the only person  once a year or two, you're the one guy who brings me out of my hermetic cave  i live a bit of a strange life because i'm not on   not strange   it doesn't feel strange to me, it feels completely natural   but i'm not on facebook, or twitter, or instagram, or any of these things  i don't even know the names of most of them  i have an email account, though  i do have that   inaudible   i cultivate empty space as a way of life for the creative process  so, timbo, you're the one guy that brings me out of the cave  we have a lot of fun together   tim ferriss   so you were talking about these top performers and getting to know them on a very deep, subtle level so that you can help them express the combination of their madness and genius   or at least embrace it among other things  how do you think about parenting?  josh waitzkin   yeah, let's dig into this one  and then let's remember to look back, after this, to finish this discussion of   first of all, you were talking about how to cultivate the sematic awareness     crosstalk  tim ferriss   and then how to listen to it   josh waitzkin   and then how to listen to it  so let's go back there to training to listen to it  okay, parenting jack  well, jack's the love of my life  this kid is such an awesome dude and parenting has been the most fantastic learning experience i've ever gone through  so, from when he was born, i tried very hard not to go into it with a lot of  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    preconceived ideas and to be attuned to him   to listen to him  from when he was just days, weeks old, he was teaching me  you talk about teaching presence   our eyes would be connected and if i would think about something else, his eyes would pull me back  and if there were any distractions other than him, he would pull me back  and, as he got a little bit older, he would just take my face and pull it back in the sweetest way  and so the depth of connection   being deeply attuned to a young spirit that hasn't become blocked, that is in that state of unobstructed self expression, that is just this unbelievably game learner, unblocked learner  jack is the gamest little person i've ever known in my own life  and, of course, i have been thinking about learning and education for a lot of years and so i had some thoughts  and so, for example, i think that the need for control is something that inhibits people in life  the need to have external conditions be just so in order for them to be able to   right  timbo's pointing at my grandmother's painting  that was my grandma's painting  it's a beauty, right? tim ferriss   it's great   josh waitzkin   yeah  stella waitzkin  that's her self portrait  okay, we're going to leave it messed up  we're working on control  so, from a young age, for me when i started playing chess, i would create chaos on the board like i described  then i would play in chess shops with people blowing smoke and playing music and i'd play chess with loud gyuto monk chants bursting in my head from speakers  when i'd play cards, i would never   playing gin rummy, i'd always keep the melds out of order so     crosstalk  tim ferriss   say that again?  josh waitzkin   when i would play cards     crosstalk  tim ferriss   oh, cards   josh waitzkin   a card game like gin rummy  i would never organize my hand  i'd always keep it     crosstalk  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   did you say meld?  josh waitzkin   yeah, like if you have three 7s or     crosstalk  tim ferriss   oh, okay  alright   josh waitzkin   or like jack, queen, jack, queen, queen   tim ferriss   oh, got it    crosstalk  josh waitzkin   i would keep everything out of order so i'd have to reorganize it in my mind  i'd keep my room messy so i    tim ferriss   oh, you wouldn't gather your   i see  you wouldn't move your cards around to organized    josh waitzkin   right   tim ferriss   got you   josh waitzkin   i was creating chaos to try and train at being able to be at peace in chaos and organize things in   that was part of my way of life and i found it to be a huge advantage that i had, competitively  and so, one of the biggest mistakes that i observed in the first year of jack's life   or year 2 of jack's life   that i observed as parents is that they have this language around weather being good or bad   tim ferriss   and whenever it was raining, they'd be like, ""it's bad weather "" you'd hear moms, babysitters, dads, talk about, ""it's bad weather  we can't go out,"" or, ""it's good weather  we can go out "" and so that means that, somehow, we're externally reliant on conditions being perfect in order to be able to go out and have a good time  so jack and i never missed a single storm  i don't think we've missed one storm   other than maybe one when he was sick   but i don't think we've missed a single storm, rain or snow, going outside and romping in it  and we've developed this language around how beautiful it was  and so now, whenever it's a rainy day, jack says, ""look, dada, it's such a beautiful rainy day,"" and we go out and we play in it  and i wanted him to have this internal locus of control   to not be reliant on external conditions being just so  and now he's four   he's getting older   so we've been playing with these things   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    we began meditating together when he was a little over a year, just doing breath work  and, essentially, we started doing meditation work when he was in that most pure states  when he'd be taking a warm bath and he was lying on his back and being completely relaxed, blissed out, we would just naturally breathe together  i wanted a habit to be formed in something that was   the initial experience   to be in conditions that were most conducive to natural peace  and then we have, in recent months, been taking it to an interesting, funky place  so he was watching me do the wim hof training and i'd be putting my hands in ice buckets and doing this interesting breath work through cold water  and he would initially watch and he'd come over and stick his finger in, put his hand in  so there's this great moment a couple months ago   we were out romping in this huge snow storm and jack   about ten minutes into it   we just got on this long search for the right carrot to put out to make the snowman with    crosstalk  tim ferriss   oh, for the nose   josh waitzkin   for the nose  we found it  and then jack got in this huge drift and his boots just loaded up with snow  and he looked at me and he said, ""dada, my feet are cold  my boots are filled with snow but that's okay  i'll just do the wim hof and make them warm "" and i looked at him   then, for an hour and a half, we played after that, just feet covered with snow and he was completely fine   never mentioned it again  and then he got increasingly interested in this internal terrain  and we would take hot baths together   we take a bath together every night   and then he would want to turn on the cold shower and get in it  and we'd play what we called the ""it's so good game "" and so we'd reframe this thing   people tend to bounce off of discomfort, whether it's mental or physical  and so if they run into internal resistance   whether it's in meditation training, or someone exposing a weakness, or if they're training and somebody might be better than them, whatever it is   they bounce away from things that might expose them   tim ferriss   they're repelled from it   josh waitzkin   right  but the flip side of this is to learn   the way i talk about living on the other side of pain   pain being mental or physical discomfort   and much of life that's so rich comes from being on  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    the other side of it  the other side of challenge   internal or external challenge  and then, with jack, i'm not using that but, as a little child's embodiment of it, we started to play with turning on the cold water and he would say, ""it's so good, dada "" and we'd be in the hot bath and play in the cold and he'd say, ""it's so good  it's so good "" and he began to have this gorgeous, blissful smile meditating through it  and he would say, ""i'm meditating through it  it's so good "" and we were reframing cold   cold is a metaphor   from something that you bounce away from to something that you can learn to sit with, to be neutral in, to find pleasure in  tim ferriss   just like the weather   josh waitzkin   just like the weather  we had this experience the other day where he said to me, ""dada, will you tickle me slowly?"" and i always tickle him and he laughs uproariously  but we were lying in bed and i was tickling him very slowly and he said, ""i'm going to do my meditation  i m going to meditate "" then the next day, he said, ""dada, will you tickle me slowly?"" and i did it and he said, ""will you tickle me a little bit faster "" and i didn't suggest this to him   he suggested it to me  and then we play this game where we say 1 to 10 and i would tickle him slowly and he'd start doing his meditation  and then we'd move it from 1, 2, and we'd go up to   he'd be doing his meditation   and then, finally, i'd be full tilt tickling him  he'd normally be in hysterics and he was just sitting there meditating and not laughing  and he found this so interesting and he's now guiding the process in this beautiful way  and now we're turning it to talking about     crosstalk  tim ferriss   question, just to interject   josh waitzkin   yeah?  tim ferriss   did you, at any point, condition him to be proactive in that way or was it just an organic, ""now i'm in the driver's seat,""?  josh waitzkin   i think i encourage him to grab the wheel all the time  a huge part of my relationship to parenting   and this is from my mom  i watch my mom with jack and i think this is maybe the greatest gift that my mom gave me is having a sense of agency in the world   the  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    idea that having a sense that i can impact the world and that my compass really matters  so, when i grew up, i wasn't ""seen but not heard "" when i was five and six, they were having adult conversations with friends and i was part of it  they wanted to hear my ideas and i felt that they mattered  and that's a big part of how my wife and i believe in raising jack  so he plays a really active role in everything that we do and so it was a natural thing and it was all fun and play  i wasn't pushing any of these things on him at all   this is stuff that he wanted to do   but then he, naturally   i've been blown away by how he's been transferring this stuff over  lateral thinking or thematic thinking   the ability to take a lesson from one thing and transfer it over to another   i think is one of the most important disciplines that any of us can cultivate or ways of being  and that's something that jack and i   from a really young age, we began to cultivate this from when he was really small around this principal of ""go around "" the first time it happened is that he was really tiny and he was trying to get in   we were staying in a little cottage in martha's vineyard, a tiny little college in a big field   and he was trying to get in one door and he couldn't but he could get in the other door  and i said, ""jack, go around "" and he looked at me and then he went around  and then ""go around,"" became a language for us physically   if you can't go one way, you go around to another way  but then it became a language for us in terms of solving puzzles and in terms of any time you run into an obstacle, go around  and then, working with the metaphor of ""go around"" opened up this way that we would just have dialogue around connecting things   taking away of a principle from one thing and applying it to something else   and we've had a lot of fun with that  and so it's fascinating to see this game little dude have this thematic dialogue, principle driven dialogue, where we're cultivating sematic awareness, cultivating the ability to feel these little ripples inside him  and jack's telling me his dreams in this beautiful way  he tells me how his emotions feel in his body  it's a great journey  i'm learning so much from him  tim ferriss   there's a book you've mentioned to me a number of times   or at least a researcher   and i'm probably going to massacre this name, as well  is it carol dweck   am i getting that right   mindset?  josh waitzkin   yeah  carol dweck mindset  yeah  it's fixed and entity theories of intelligence versus incremental or growth mindset   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    yeah, carol dweck's one of the most important foundational developmental psychologists around this distinction of a fixed perspective on how good somebody is  let's frame it like this   most children, unfortunately, are educated to believe that they have a certain ingrained level of ability in things  tim ferriss   ""you are smart  you are dumb  you are average ""  josh waitzkin   right  and they're told   and the sad thing is that, even when they're praised, they're told how smart they are or, ""you're such a good writer  you're so good at math "" and the kids will say, ""i'm smart at this,"" or, ""i'm dumb at that "" but if you're very smart at one thing, then that means that, if you fail, then you must be dumb at it  and so it becomes very static and the kids are often quite brittle when they have a fixed mindset or an entity theory of intelligence  well, a growth mindset   or a mastery oriented mindset   is one where we understand that the path to mastery involves incremental growth  we don't have an ingrained level of ability at something  we're going to have successes and failures  we're going to work at things and it's work   it's practice   and it's an open mindedness to life experiences that makes us succeed   tim ferriss   how would the praise differ?  josh waitzkin   you would praise a kid for the process versus the outcome  and so you would say, ""i'm so proud of how hard you worked at your math,"" not, ""you're so smart at math "" or if someone has a failure, the other side of it is not to say, ""don't worry about it  you're just not good at math  you'll do something else "" it's to say, ""well, how can we practice at this to get better?"" and so we're focusing on the process and not the outcome  that's the fundamental principle  and it's so easy to say it but it's very hard for people to live it to parent, especially if they don't embody it themselves  what you see often with kids and parents is that the parents are fundamentally fixed   they have an entity of their intelligence themselves  they're fixed  they're stuck  but they've read the material of carol dweck or somebody else and they want to parent their kids around the growth mindset but the kids see what they embody, not what they say  so we have to embody it  one of the most important things i think that we do with my foundation   and i work with schools with programs around the world   is that, when we're working with teachers, it's not just, ""this is the material you should teach your students,"" it's working with these core principles  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and embodying it themselves first  and then, through that embodied intelligence, working with the kids on how they can embody it  they have to walk the talk  tim ferriss   okay, so let's go back to what we said we should go back to at some point which is sematics and sensitivity   those dimples of light in the darkness that most people overlook  how do you train that?  josh waitzkin   well, thematically, the first thing i would say is, that when you think about cultivating an internal locus of control   or internal orientation versus an external one  so as an artist or as a performer, we have all these external pressures on us  let's say, for example, let's talk about investors again  let's say an investor is running a  1 million investment vehicle and they have partners   they have people who invest in that  and they have to write investment letters  they have all the partners   say they have 30, 40, or 50 partners who are institutions   maybe educational endowments, charities, whatever   who have put their money into this investment vehicle  and maybe that person has his own money, as well   or her own money   in this investment vehicle  well, for them to be successful, they have to operate from the inside out  they have to bring out the essence of who they are as a performer, like we're discussing, or as a human being  they have to bring that out through their art  but if they are constantly feeling pressured by what others expect from them, what others want from them, how they'll be perceived, or how people are looking at their posts, or how their tweet is being responded to  it's tweet? that's what it is, right?  tim ferriss   that's right   josh waitzkin   see? it's so interesting for me, watching people watch their instagram accounts  i see it with buddies all the time  and it's natural   it's completely human   but then we're aware of how we're perceived  one of the major reasons that i stay away from these things is because i can feel how susceptible i am to this stuff  you publish a book and it's on amazon, it's so hard not to go look at the amazon numbers  and if the book comes out and you're tracking them, even if you know it's ridiculous and you shouldn't be doing it   someone like you, you're such a world class    and you have so systematically trained at and cultivated the ability to market these things  this is actually a very important scientific input for you  it's not for most authors   most authors, it's an  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    addiction  so that's a completely different point, in my opinion  you're actually gathering data and using it  most people are just constantly feeling    crosstalk  tim ferriss   tapping the vein   josh waitzkin   right  tapping the vein  so, with investors that this often relates to is p   l checking   profit and loss checking   tim ferriss   oh, i'm sure   josh waitzkin   right  so, most investors check p   l hundreds of times a day  in fact, it's constantly because it's on their screen all the time  imagine having these little adrenal hits all the time   whether it's dopamine or cortisol, whether they're making money or losing money, they're constantly bouncing off of these things  that's the ultimate external orientation  so if you think about internal plus proactive versus external plus reactive  this is how i would tend to frame this out  we want to build a proactive way of life that's fundamentally moved from the inside out versus a reactive way of life where we're constantly reacting to all of these inputs which we may or may not want and where we're constantly beleaguered by or pressed by a sense of how we're going to be perceived   social pressures  and then you're talking about a really high level artist who might have a really subtle intuition about something and they should listen to that intuition or they should at least deconstruct that and then investigate it and see if it's the right way to go  but they're aware that that intuition might not be perceived as impressive by others  the problem is that the others usually aren't world class artists  they're the armchair professors  they're the philosophologists  and so you have the man in the arena who's compromised by a sense of self consciousness of how the critics are going to perceive him or her which is ridiculous because it's like an a player thinking about the approval of a c player and that's disastrous  that's external orientation  that's thinking that we're going to get food poisoning from something   that something's off   and then dismissing it because of   first of all, there's the incredibly subtle sense   that's how strong the intuition is  no one else at that table there   and we had some pretty high level dudes sitting at that table   had that feeling that we were about to eat something that had food poisoning  so it was very subtle  you had a very subtle  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    sense  it wasn't ""bang you over the head "" and then there's a feeling of the social pressures and everything  it's a very interesting subtle example but the subtle pressures were louder in that case than in the really subtle intuition that you had  and then there's having the attitude of, ""i don't care about the social pressures,"" but that's really hard  tim ferriss   which i was able to do a third of the way through    crosstalk  josh waitzkin   but you did    crosstalk  tim ferriss   but not before   josh waitzkin   right  i think, in my observation, you've really evolved this  you have so much external pressure and external awareness on you  i consistently find it stunning and impressive how you're able to embrace your funk to live a life that is attuned to your inner ripples  i think it's actually rather unique  i think it's a core strength of yours, in my opinion   tim ferriss   thanks, man  i think that one element that's been very helpful in trying to mitigate the risks and dangers in that, in the paradox of trying to be introspective while having a very public facing life   is stoicism   josh waitzkin   yup   tim ferriss   and i remember reading, at one point   i want to say it was cato who was considered by his contemporaries and his successors in stoic thought leadership to be the perfect stoic in a lot of respects   and i'm going to get the colors wrong here, but he would deliberately wear, i think it was, a blue tunic as opposed to a purple tunic to encourage people to ridicule him because he wanted to be embarrassed about only those things worth being embarrassed about  so training himself not to be overly sensitized to the critiques of the c players around him  and so i constantly   i remember, for instance   this is such a silly example   but i was just in montana and i went into the ski shop to get some light gloves   just for walking around, not for skiing   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and i looked at the whole rack and i was like, ""oh, i like these,"" and they were the most ridiculous, dr  seuss striped nonsense gloves you've ever seen  like, they will not match with anything just ludicrous looking  and i asked someone at the front desk, i'm like, ""what do you think of these or should i get a different one?"" she's like, ""nah, i think you should get the black ones "" and i thought about it  i sat there and i thought about it  i was like, ""nope, i'm getting the dr  seuss gloves "" so i got the dr  seuss gloves  and that expresses itself for me in a lot of different places because i will, for instance, do   and this is not something i recommend to everybody so, caveat emptor, you're in control of your own life so if you do this, you could face some dire consequences   but i'll do drunk q   as on facebook  and i'll have a bunch of booze and i'll go on and i'll do a q   a  something will come out that will embarrass me but it's not going to be life destroying  and so it's that i systematically create an environment in which i don't have a reputation to protect which is another reason i talk about the psychedelics and i'll talk very openly about monogamy versus non monogamy, and i'll throw all these things out there to basically ensure a) that i never become a politician and b) that i don't feel like i have a fixed identity to cling to that i need to protect  because i see how disastrous that can be  josh waitzkin   yeah, that's really powerful  and you know the fire of competition plays that role, as well  you look at people who compete   let's talk about martial artists  so i own a brazilian jui jitsu school with marcela garcia  we discuss marcelo a lot   tim ferriss   definitely  just as i mentioned creating chaos and training yourself to operate optimally in chaos compared to others and, of course, marcelo, who is what, ten time? nine time?  josh waitzkin   nine time   tim ferriss   world champion is the master at scramble?  josh waitzkin   yeah, they call him the king of the scramble   tim ferriss   the king of the scramble   josh waitzkin   he is the greatest transitional player in the history of the sport, maybe  he's incredible  the essence of his game is to not hold to allow people to move and to, again, embrace the chaos and get their first  he just has cultivated the transition just so  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    systematically that he has ten frames in transitions where somebody else will just be moving from one position to the next  but that transition, itself, is something which is that's his ocean  it's a beautiful thing to see  but, if you look at the school, marcelo runs the school so beautifully and we've got, at this point, a lot of world class competitors  the school tends to win pretty much all the tournaments  a lot of guys who you've trained with    crosstalk  tim ferriss   who did the tim ferriss experiment? that was hilarious   josh waitzkin   oh my god, that was awesome  we got beat    crosstalk  tim ferriss   day 1, i'm like, ""okay, i think i broke my rib ""  josh waitzkin   he did great, man  you did great   tim ferriss   oh, thanks   josh waitzkin   i was proud of you  yeah, guys, you should check that out  that was pretty     crosstalk  tim ferriss   the tv show  if you want to see me get my ass handed to me and have great time training with guys like john stava, who is an incredible athlete and teacher   josh waitzkin   yeah  john is fantastic   tim ferriss   that's a tv show worth checking out  but not     crosstalk  josh waitzkin   well, if you look at the learning curve of the people in the school   the ones who put themselves in the line as a way of life just learn much faster than the ones who are protecting their egos  most schools, what happens is someone gets good and then they have to win to protect their status as being very good or dominant  it usually happens with martial arts instructors, which is that they reach a certain level, they open a school, they get a little bit older, they get a little fatter, they have a reputation so they stop training because they don't want to be exposed by the young students who  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    are coming up  and they sit on the sidelines but their egos get increasingly large but riddled with insecurity  and this brittleness tends to then splay down to the students and the whole school becomes a joke  versus the way marcelo runs our school which is so magnificent   everyone's on the mat training so hard as a way of the life  everyone's on a world class growth curve  and it's very interesting to observe who the top competitors pick out when they're five rounds into the sparring sessions and they're completely gassed  the ones who are on the steepest growth curve look for the hardest guy there   the one who might beat them up while others look for someone they can take a break on  and so there's that constant search for exposure  and that's a parallel to what you're describing in terms of not having an ego to protect or you said not having   tim ferriss   yeah, a reputation     crosstalk  josh waitzkin   not having a reputation to protect   tim ferriss   a fixed identity to protect   josh waitzkin   right  so this is a way, as a competitor, to constantly put yourself into the fire   tim ferriss   here's the question i have to for you   because i feel like, particularly in jiu jitsu, i could get better at this   do you remember when we, that one day tied the gi on and you're like, ""timbo, your lips are purple "" i thought i was going to die  i thought i was going to have heat stroke and have to be carted off  so is it correlation or causation, meaning are the guys who, on round 5, pick the hardest guy in the room, have they already selfselected by coming to this school, in a sense, or did they start off, perhaps, when they walked in the door, the guy who would pick the easiest person in the room at round 5 and have been converted into the guy who will pick the hardest person there?  josh waitzkin   you see both?  tim ferriss   you see both?  josh waitzkin   you see both   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   in the latter case, how do they cultivate that transition?  josh waitzkin   i think that marcelo is a great role model     crosstalk  tim ferriss   because i think that's a fantastic metaphor for life, right? you get this everywhere   josh waitzkin   100 percent  i think that we think about this principle of cultivating qualities as a way of life in the big things and the little things  and when you look at the way marcelo runs that training environment, it is pretty exceptional  if people don't have     crosstalk  tim ferriss   he puts his ass on the line all the time   josh waitzkin   his ass is on the line all the time  and he's getting a little bit older  he has two kids and he's a wonderful dad  his life is not just 100 percent jiu jitsu anymore  he has all of these young 20s   at this point world class students who want to go at it hard with him and he goes at it hard with them  he wants to  he doesn't mind getting exposed  he brings it  he's living it but he's also creating an environment where people are present to quality in little things  if someone doesn't have their gi on straight, if they haven't tied their belt, if they're sitting in a way that's sloppy    tim ferriss   what happens? does he  ?  josh waitzkin   he tells them to straighten their gi   tim ferriss   i love that   josh waitzkin   when people are doing the warmup, if they're cutting the corner a little bit, he tells them to run the full circle  if people are doing a certain drill in a sloppy way, he refines it  so it's the little things  as you watch marcelo doing the warmup, there's a way that he'll have his hand and just brush against the mat as he passes it  you can feel him engaging his tactile, feeling for the room  he's someone who embodies and teaches quality as a way of life  so, if you're in your fourth or fifth round and you are looking for a way out, you feel that you're fundamentally violating this principle which you've been cultivating   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   attending at the school?  josh waitzkin   right  and this is so important  a core part of how i train people is around the interplay of themes or principles and habits  the habits are what we can actually train at  the principle is what we're trying to embody  and so we'll train at two, or three, or four, or five habits which are the embodiment of a core principle but the idea is to burn the principle into the hundreds of manifestations of that principle that will become our way of life  and so, in this case, we're talking marcelo embodying the principle of quality in all these little ways  these little ways, you could say don't matter but they add up to matter hugely   tim ferriss   oh, i think the little things are the big things   josh waitzkin   yeah   tim ferriss   because they're a reflection   this may sound clich  but it's like how you do anything is how you do everything   josh waitzkin   it's such a beautiful and critical principle and most people think they can wait around for the big moments to turn it on  but if you don't cultivate turning it on as a way of life in the little moments   and there's hundreds of times more little moments than big   then there's no chance in the big moments   tim ferriss   yeah  okay, so if people listening don't take anything else from this interview, i think that's so key to who you are  it's so key to why you've been good at what you've been good at  that's it, right there  and there's a   let me mangle another name since that seems to be one of our themes for the show this episode   i think is archilochus, perhaps  i'm going to get this wrong  but it was a quote   got to be a roman, maybe a greek, who knows   who said, ""we do not raise the level of our hopes  we fall to the level of our training ""  josh waitzkin   yeah   tim ferriss   and you can't just do one every five years, waiting for the big event  you're not going to have the training necessary   josh waitzkin   as a principle that i've been thinking about a lot about on parenting  you see so often people with their second child are not as present   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    now, unfortunately, in today's world, people are often not present with their first child, either  i was taking a walk, yesterday, with a dear friend of mine in central park and, at dusk, we were just talking about one of the ideas we've been thinking about  and we walked past this woman who had three children in a stroller and was walking her dog, and the children were all talking to her, and she was on the cell phone   and it wasn't a quick   it was a long gossipy conversation  and i was just watching this exquisite external environment, the embodiment of distraction  three children and a dog   the children looking, trying to pull her but she was just in this other world  we think about the distraction of parenting  and then you think about what often happens with parents of the first child  they're completely tapped in   because this is all new, they're present  and then, the second child, they relatively neglect  we see that all the time  i m thinking about this a lot because we're about to have our second child  and so i'm thinking about how important it is to not take for granted the things that you've done right and think they'll just be there because they're not going to be there unless you're equally present  and we see this in the martial arts as someone who trains twice a day as a way of life for ten years   training until they drop and doing external training, as well, with strengthening, and conditioning, and stretching, and everything else  and then they get to a place where they're consistently winning and then they think they can train seven times a week instead of ten and it'll be the same  it's not the same  that slippage shows  there's something incredible about going into competition knowing that there's no way anybody else trained as hard or as good as you   as smart  we're not talking about training quantitatively   we're talking about training qualitatively  the confidence that comes out of knowing, in any discipline that you're at, that you gave it your all   when i work with someone, i say that one of my many filters is looking at someone in the eye and saying that working with me is living as if you're training qualitatively as if in a world championship training camp  qualitatively  but i look at them in the eye and some people, you see a fear   you see the fear or exposure  other people, you see a lean in   an eagerness, a gameness, a hunger for what that exposure will lead to  those are two very, very different paths  maintaining presence to that quality, even after we've assumed that we've got it nailed   you see this with people around presence  there's so much bullshit in the meditation world, for example  tim ferriss   so much bullshit   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    josh waitzkin   because people might have meditated wonderfully for four or five years, or six years, or eight years but then they get ego involved with it  and then they put together schools and they're not embodying it anymore and then it becomes hollow  and they slip from the philosopher to the philosophologist without even knowing that it happened  they weren't even present to the question   tim ferriss   firewalking process   josh waitzkin   yeah, that's important   tim ferriss   what is the firewalking process? this is new to me, too  i'm not sure i've heard you discuss this   josh waitzkin   yeah, this is something that i've been really, for the last year or half or so, been developing intensely  i think it's been a core part of my process for some time but training people, i've been on this really intense learning curve on how to work with people on this  so the core to the principle is that people tend to learn from their own experiences with much more potency than they learn from other people's experiences  and the firewalking process, that's my term for a gateway to cultivating the ability to learn with the same physiological intensity from other people's experiences as we learned from our own  so, for example, if you're a jiu jitsu fighter and you slightly overextend your arm and you get arm barred, and let's say you're juan morales in the world championships and your arm is being separated from your body and you feel like your shoulder is disconnecting, your arm is breaking   if you don't tap, you're going to break it  and, often, guys will fight it  they won't want to tap  so they have the combination of huge disappointment, all the adrenal reactions to being caught and being wounded and maybe torn ligaments or tendons, depending on how the injury sets in   or maybe a bone  and they will burn that lesson into themselves and they will not overextend their arm that way again  that's been burned in on an animalistic level  but if they watch somebody fighting and they watch them overextend and get caught in an arm bar, that's nothing  that's an intellectual knowledge that has no impact on whether or not they'll overextend  but if we can cultivate the ability to learn from other people's errors or experiences with the same intensity as we can learn from our own, it's unbelievable how that can steepen the learning curve   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   what would be an example of that beyond jiu jitsu?  josh waitzkin   well, for example, a really interesting live example that i'm playing with today is we're working actively with investors and we are   a brilliant investor recently used the term, ""the pavlovian impact,"" or ""the pavlovian influences"" have grown up in a bull market  most relatively young investors grew up in a post 2008 world so all of their subtle responses have come from growing up in a bull market  so, for the most part, they've experienced pleasure when they put the foot on the gas and they've experienced pain when they take the foot off the gas   for the most part  that's oversimplified  it's really interesting to sit down and think about all of the cognitive biases, all of the subtle associations that come with growing up in a bull market  traditionally, what people will say is you have to live through certain business cycles   the school of hard knocks   we have to learn through the pain of the other side  but can you take a highly talented young investor who has grown up in a bull market and give them the wisdom   you're thinking about the journey from pre consciousness to postconsciousness competitor around a certain theme  give them the wisdom of living through many market cycles when they haven't so then they can deconstruct systematically what does a bear market look like? now i'm not sure if we're in the beginning of a bear market now but let's just say that we are maybe in the first or second inning of a bear market now  maybe we're in the tail   the eighth or ninth innings   of a bull market  maybe we're in the ninth inning of a bull market and we're going to see some huge run of intervention and we're going to go into extra innings of a bull market  no one really knows  maybe there's some other dynamic at play  even the great macroeconomists don't know but they have a sense through deep study of either macroeconomics or valuation  but we are, at one point, relatively soon, we'll probably enter a bear market so it's going to be very important  and so if you haven't lived through one, one thing you can do is you can deconstruct what a bear market looks like and you can have them firewalk it  and so what that means is suddenly all of the   and a bear market doesn't just mean going down  it actually means the subtle undulation of as often going down for three weeks, and then a really steep two week rally, and then going down again for three week, then two week rally  so people often   even people who think the market will go down get really hurt in bear markets because it's violent, there's a volatility to it   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   volatility, yeah   josh waitzkin   and so the question is how can, in this case, an investor who's grown up in a post 2008 world firewalk market cycles so that he can burn that wisdom into himself or herself? and then the question is how you do this so a lot of the things that we discussed around physiological awareness   sematic awareness, cultivating the sensitivity to what's happening inside of us   what comes with that is the ability to switch state, emotionally, adrenally  and so, if we visualize something very painful to us   if we visualize with tremendous potency   we can have a physiological response to that   tim ferriss   true even of exercise training  people who, say, take a ten minute meditation visualization session in lieu of   oh, there we go  alright  that means we have to go pick up jack from school   josh waitzkin   we have to go pick up jack so we'll take a break   tim ferriss   but they can get the benefits of the exercise, in large part, just from the visualization over ten minutes  but we have to go grab jack   josh waitzkin   to be continued   tim ferriss   to be continued   josh waitzkin   awesome    end audio   begin audio  tim ferriss   okay, so we're back   josh waitzkin   we're back   tim ferriss   we reclaimed the boy from school and ate some japanese food   talked about life and now here we are for the continuation  firewalking, visualization, we're going to talk about casts  let's continue with firewalking   josh waitzkin   yes  we were just bringing up the physical dynamics that are possible with intense visualization   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    i had this formative experience that i wrote about years ago where i broke my hand seven weeks before a national championship when i was training in chinese martial arts push hands and i was in a cast for six weeks up until, i think, three days before the nationals  and the doc said i couldn't compete in everything because i'd be atrophied but i was committed to doing it  and it was really interesting because i was just doing all of my training one handed and visualizing the weight work that i was doing on the one side passing over to the other  tim ferriss   the weight work? resistance training   josh waitzkin   yeah  i was doing my martial arts training one handed   which was fascinating on its own to just work on being able to do with one hand what you can do with two, that was tremendous   but i was also visualizing the resistance training i was doing on one side passing over to the other  but really intense visualization, not just thinking of it but burning it into   that's kind of when i made my firewalking distinction between thinking about it intellectually, sort of trying to visualize it versus burning it in   tim ferriss   with every sensory simulation?  josh waitzkin   yeah, with your whole spirit, burning it in deeply  and it was fascinating to see   when i took off the cast, i had basically not atrophied and i competed two days, three days later and won  the doctors, they were pretty surprised by it  a lot of western medicine is surprised by   they're pretty close minded about these kinds of things   tim ferriss   what would you do to translate that to something less obviously physical   like we were talking about training people who have never been through a bear market to have the wisdom or the lessons learned of those who have been through it? so, pragmatically, how do you simulate that? do you have them interview someone who's gone through it and then try to relive those stories through visualization or what would the process potentially look like?  josh waitzkin   so cultivation of empathy   to be able to do what you just described very deeply   is one thing   to be able to live someone else's experience profoundly  first of all, we have to really be clear about the distinction between intellectual knowledge and sematic knowledge  when we're having something burned in, there's an adrenal response  there's a  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    physiology to having an experience very intensely  we have to learn how to create that physiology  so we can do biofeedback training, undulating between states of physiological coherence and states of extreme stress so that we build up the ability to move between them at will  and then, when we're studying, for example, the experience of somebody getting burned extremely intensely, time and again, in a bear market during the volatility   the ups and downs of a bear market   you can look at it and it can feel just like a chart or you can experience the anxiety that comes with it, the pain that comes with it, the shattering of your previous conceptual scheme  you can almost firewalk the experience of the pavlovian experience of growing up in a bull market and then having that shattered   you can firewall that shattering and then open your mind to the reality of the broader cyclicality over the long term  and there's a lot of, in terms of how you do it, well, the foundation is in a lot of things we've been discussing   intense meditation training, ways of becoming increasingly attuned to these subtle ripples inside your body, stilling your waters, having a lifestyle which is less reactive, less input addicted  being really aware of how we fill space addictively in life   whenever there's empty space, we just fill it as opposed to maintaining the emptiness  and the emptiness is where we have the clarity of mind and the perception of these little micro ripples inside of us  cultivating the ability to observe in us   and in others   the subtlest undulations of quality or of physiology  tim ferriss   you and i talk a lot about maintaining slack     crosstalk  josh waitzkin   yeah    crosstalk  tim ferriss     and trying to build slack into the system and how important that is   josh waitzkin   yeah   tim ferriss   and i was told by someone i respect a lot, recently, is that you have to listen from the silence and that might sound very vague but i've found that, if you really meditate on it, it can apply to just about anything  if you really want to separate the signal from the noise, you need the space to do that   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    josh waitzkin   right  it's such an important principle   tim ferriss   alright  we're going to take a break  we have to    josh waitzkin   baby time  jack is up from his nap    end audio   begin audio  tim ferriss   and we're back to your regular programming  joshua?  josh waitzkin   we're talking about slack while the slack is expiring in the system here   tim ferriss   very impassioned cries from upstairs   josh waitzkin   yeah, our aim today was to do this in the morning while jack was in school   tim ferriss   but fortune intervened   josh waitzkin   yes   tim ferriss   and changed our plans   josh waitzkin   yes  this principle of slack is so interesting  for me, a lot of it relates to the empty space for the learning process  in my way of life, i've built a life around having empty space for the development of my ideas in the creative process and for the cultivation of a physiological state which is receptive enough to tune in very, very deeply to people i work with  and so i can see how i could triple the amount of people that i work with very easily with the systems that i have but my growth curve would get much   it would change fundamentally and my internal physiological training would take a hit   i wouldn t have enough time for meditation, for reflection afterward, for development of the thematic takeaways of every session that i have  in the creative process, it's so easy to drive for efficiency and take for granted the really subtle internal work that it takes to play on that razor's edge   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   i think, in part, it comes back to the limiting of input and selective ignorance you talked about  because if you triple the number of clients you have in a high tech and high touch business, you're going to have to juggle 17 training styles instead of 2 training styles   josh waitzkin   right  and then i'm reacting  i'm not embodying the core principles we're working on  and so much of, i find, really highlevel training is sematic transmission  you're embodying a certain state and then you're helping somebody embody that state, as well   tim ferriss   totally agree with that  and i think if you want a good example of that, just as a relatively new dog owner as an adult, if you look at dogs and children who are fundamentally unblocked in that sematic reading ability  and you can see   just as you said, as a parent transmits their state of being to their child despite or with the assistance of whatever they might say   similarly, if you're interacting adult to adult, you need to return to that state to be maximally effective in what you do, in particular   josh waitzkin   right  and then when we're talking about dancing on the razor's edge, so when you're moving up the growth curve in a certain discipline, there's a lot of things that you can do to reach the first 80th, or 90th, or 95th percentile of something  when you're talking about the last  001 percent, you're talking about these arenas where the greatest insight will be right next to the greatest blunder  and you have to be willing to go just right on that razor's edge  i was having this great conversation with the sports psychologist, michael gervais a couple weeks ago and he had used this language of thrusting into big waves  the experience he had to go into to push himself as a surfer to thrust into big waves  i love that expression  but, of course, if you're thrusting into big waves, then you can easily push yourself into the wave you shouldn t take  so big wave surfers have to be able to navigate the most finely tuned, in the moment, just intuitive decisionmaking process of whether the moment is just right or whether it's a moment that will kill you  and then, if you're working with people, as a coach or as a trainer of people who are navigating that terrain, you have to be in a state where you can navigate that terrain  you have to have an embodied state there  and i think that's a mistake that a lot of people make in everything that they do  they just scale   they scale and dilute the quality  and when you dilute quality, you lose the ability to successfully navigate the razor's  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    edge and then, by definition, you're probably more destructive than you are helpful  and so when i think about people who are in that place   99 9 percent listening   and ideally, you can make the most potent suggestions with the lightest touch feasible  tim ferriss   so the notes   i took some notes beforehand here, or borrowed some notes beforehand   and one of them touches on the principle of scarcity in a) habit creation, b) the learning process, c) the creative process  i don't know if we'll have time for all of these right now but could you just elaborate on the principle of scarcity?  josh waitzkin   so, if we think about the idea of subtraction or essentialism or scarcity, you, frankly, are as good as it gets, in my opinion, at harnessing the principle of scarcity  in your learning process, learning how to deconstruct something, focusing on what's absolutely most essential, and zoning in on it as opposed to just throwing huge amounts of resources at things and just having a diluted quality of approach  most people, when they become successful, they have the opportunity to have more resources and they keep on layering more and more resources on things so they're not very potent in how they go about things  if you cut those resources down 99 percent, then you find yourself just zoning in on what's most essential  and then, if you can learn to add resources incrementally, maintaining that potency, it's incredible what you can do but it takes a lot of discipline to maintain that principle of scarcity  so, in habit creation, taking on the right amount of not too much   not too little, but not too much   people tend to think about layering on   they get excited when they realize   if i go through a diagnostic process and they realize there are ten areas they can take on, they want to take on all of them at once  you can only really take on one or two things at once   ideally, one theme and you take on two or three manifestations of that theme to burn that theme on and then you keep on layering  in the creative process, you talk about limiting inputs   or we've been talking about limiting inputs   tim ferriss   positive constraints, yeah   josh waitzkin   right  positive constraints  listen, me speaking about this principle to you   you embody this principle profoundly  what are your thoughts on it?  tim ferriss   well, there are a few things  just to maybe add a couple of anecdotes to what you just said, the first thing that came to mind was a quote   and i'm going to butcher this   but it's from jack ma  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    of ali baba who said, ""in the beginning, we had an advantage  we had no experience, no business plan, and no money so it forced us to make all of our decisions very carefully "" and i do think that people tend to   i'm also borrowing this   but overestimate what they can accomplish in a week and underestimate what they can accomplish in a year which leads to theoretically appealing decisions like trying to adopt ten new behaviors at once that are hour wise and year foolish, in the sense that they're doomed to fail from the outset in many respects  and, to your point, also, about scaling   i have friends who call it the ""s"" word because it's a romanticized, worshipped notion in silicon valley  scale, scale, scale  got to be bigger, hire more people, ship more product and, if you are looking to optimize your craft, your art, that may or may not be the right path to doing that  and, to my mind, you can look at exemplars or you can look at examples of people who have scaled who are still critics of scaling in the sense that   bill gates, i believe, said, ""if you add people to an inefficient process, it just makes the problem worse  you have to add people to an efficient process "" and to that end, whether you are looking to build a, for instance, lifestyle business like i have   cash flow based business that represents, in some way, your craft  let's just say you make   this is a real example, actually   20 customized rifles a year  that's all you do and you sell to the top  001 percent of marksmen in the united states  you never ship more than that  that's the constraint that you want  whether you're trying to do that or build microsoft, that lesson can apply whether it's adding one person or adding the next thousand people  so, for me, i think it's very easy to create a false dichotomy in your mind when you look at, say, a small scale craftsman who's perhaps making, let's just say, oil paintings in rural alaska   versus a startup in silicon valley with 1,000 employees and think of them as totally different when, in fact, if you look at the top performers in either environment, they'll have a lot in common with each other  and one of those commonalities is applying a lot of positive constraints even when you have an embarrassment of resources available  josh waitzkin   if you think about this in terms of the creative process, one of the most important things of training is the ability to ask the right question to know where to look  and if you look at people in most creative fields who are extremely high level versus the incrementally lower fields, it's knowing what the most critical area is for thinking   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    let's pause for two minutes and then we'll continue  tim ferriss   i kind of want jack to say high to everybody   josh waitzkin   what'd you say?  tim ferriss   i kind of want jack    josh waitzkin   jack's saying hi to everybody  he's saying   we're going to get jack playing with something and then we're going to finish up   tim ferriss   okay  to be continued    end audio   begin audio  tim ferriss   okay   speaking spanish  here we have dinosaur train playing for the little one  dinosaur train creators, that one's on me  and josh has a continuation   josh waitzkin   yeah, thinking about this principle of scarcity, one of the ways that i have myself trained at this in the creative process   or harness the principle of scarcity   is to have everyone who i work with live in this routine  it's forcing yourself to, end of each day, think about what the most important question in what you're working  we discussed this last time  it's really interesting because you're studying complexity all the time and, if you're a really high level thinker, you're slicing most of this like butter  but then there's usually one, or two, or three layers of stuckness  most people, i find, tend to live in the creative process by surfacing, deciding where they want to go, putting their head down, and just grinding their way toward it, and then surfacing later on  they don't surface enough to reflect on what's the most potent direction to go  when you think about the human versus computer playing chess ten years ago   now computers are getting really good at knowing where to look   but ten years ago, the human knew that one of these two or three directions was the right essential direction in the sense that we cultivate the ability to know where to look  the computer had to look at everything  if we're looking at everything, then we're just operating like really, really bad computers but if we cultivate the ability to ask the most potent question systematically   alright, so how do we do this? well, we have a routine where we end each workday thinking, ""what's the  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    most important question in what i'm doing right now?"" pose the question to the unconscious and then wake up first thing in the morning and brainstorm on it  tim ferriss   do you have them pose it again, then?  josh waitzkin   no  actually, i think it's pretty important not to do that because then we're consciously ruminating on it  hopefully, they haven't thought about it for a few hours before they go to bed  this is something that hemingway wrote about in his writing process really beautifully   tim ferriss   hemingway would stop writing mid sentence and provide a foothold for continuing the next day   josh waitzkin   that's right  which we could also look at it from the framing of that internal versus external framing  if you're held by a sense of guilt whenever you're not working, then you're going to feel like you have to write everything you have to write  but if you're nurturing from the inside out your creative process, you're going to be comfortable stopping with a sense of direction when you're mid sentence or mid paragraph   tim ferriss   when i've talked to people who have started journaling successfully for the first time, the most consistent pattern that i see is, ""i write less than i feel like each day ""  josh waitzkin   yeah   tim ferriss   they're never pushing to max capacity or feeling like they're pushing to max  they always write less than they feel they should write   josh waitzkin   right  that's very interesting  and if we think about taking this and then turning it into a systematic training of the ability to be potent in the creative process, if we're working on a given project and we're reflecting on what's the most important question here, and we're journaling on it, and the brainstorm in the morning, we're doing a lot of things to open the channel systematically between the conscious and the unconscious mind  we're waking up in the morning and beginning our day proactively  all of these things with we discussed in the past  but then, if you sit back after, say, a month and you look back at your, say, three, or four, or five journals, brainstorms, q   as,  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    on a given subject and you think about, ""okay, so, in the moment, this is what i thought was most potent but now i realize this, in fact, would have been most potent  what's the gap?"" deconstruct the gap between your understanding then and your understanding now and then design your training process around deconstructing that gap and training at what that gap revealed  it's a really powerful way for individuals   tim ferriss   right  what assumptions underlie that gap   the creation of that gap or that blind spot   josh waitzkin   that misperception about what was most important   tim ferriss   right   josh waitzkin   and so you're training yourself, day in and day out, like water, to be an increasingly potent thinker  and this is manifesting scarcity in that we are forcing ourselves   no matter how many resources we have   to think about what is the most important question in what we're working on right now   tim ferriss   do you journal every day?  josh waitzkin   yes   tim ferriss   when do you journal?  josh waitzkin   well, i journal throughout  so i'll wake up in the morning, meditate, take a cold, then hot cold undulation shower, and then meditate, and then i will journal  i've had periods where i've just moved right   especially when i was working in lucid dream work   where i would move straight from sleep into journaling but that's my rhythm today  and then, when i have insights throughout the day, i'll do quick journals about them  and then, after i have sessions with clients, i'll do a journaling session on the most important takeaways   tim ferriss   do you do that in a notebook or do you digitally?  josh waitzkin   i do it on evernote and then i tag everything thematically which is hugely important for me  i have all of my journals and all of the resources that i find valuable tagged thematically and through habits in the language of my training process  and so this is incredibly powerful for being able to give people resources, for me  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    reviewing the ideas without having a recency bias impede, how i communicate   tim ferriss   can you say that one more time?  josh waitzkin   so if i have a client who i think has to work on a certain theme and i want to give them resources they can read on it, i can just click on the tag on evernote and all of the resources   things that i've written and things that i've read   circling that theme are there   tim ferriss   got it   josh waitzkin   and it's also really powerful because it's really hard to overcome recency bias   tim ferriss   i see  without recency bias  right  meaning the primacy in recency effect so you're recalling what you read most recently, not necessarily the best resource   josh waitzkin   right  and not necessarily the foundation of my relationship to the theme   tim ferriss   understood    crosstalk  josh waitzkin   and you want someone to learn from the foundation up  so really powerful   the tagging   i find   i'm sure evernote isn't the most   i'm not a big tech wizard, as you know    tim ferriss   just to put this in perspective, so we were looking for a   we, i'm using the wrong we   josh was looking for dinosaur train for ten minutes then he's like, ""you know what, i think i'm going to search this thing "" and i was just like, ""and you say you're not good at tech ""  josh waitzkin   it was a good showing  thanks, man   tim ferriss   no, that was a big discovery  and then jack's like, ""there goes dinosaur train "" ""it's amazing how this search function works "" should we talk about thematic interconnectedness?  josh waitzkin   yes  let's talk about it  i'd love to talk about it in the context of education a little bit  thematic interconnectedness is one of   maybe that's the essence   of my relationship to the world or beyond  you and i have, as we had our eccentric conversations all  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    over the world on surfboards and everywhere else, this has been a big topic for us  tim ferriss   yeah  constant topic   josh waitzkin   in various states  and it's been a huge part of how i've approached learning from my foundation in looking at the relationships between chess and life   learning about life through chess   then in transferring level over from chess to the martial arts, first chinese martial arts and then into brazilian jiu jitsu  and when i work with people, it's really how i learn and it's how i've found it's really powerful to help people amplify their growth curves to teach them to be able to learn the many from the few or from the one   learn the macro from the micro  break down the boundaries between different pursuits or just parts of life based on the personal, the professional, the technical and the psychological  and if we have an experience where we're on surfboards and we have some little thematic breakthrough that we can apply to every other aspect of our life, it's really interesting what can happen because we're pretty well calloused over in our areas of strength but, in areas where we're less advanced, we can be more raw  and we might be more conducive to breakthrough, sometimes   tim ferriss   oh, 100 percent  you can see things with a beginner's mind because you have no other choice   josh waitzkin   right   tim ferriss   you don't have to try to simulate beginner's mind because you are a beginner  it's like the race to the bottom experience  so, for those who are wondering what the hell that means, the race to the bottom is an expression that eric, of paddlewoo   our paddle surfing instructor   uses to refer to constantly dropping in board size, often measured in liters for buoyancy purposes  and josh and i   and everyone who is there, really   very quickly realized that you are, to use your expression, dancing the razor's edge and trying to find a balance between the race to the bottom but also maintaining motivation so you're not just slipping on banana peels for five hours straight  and to what extent do you focus on the board size and the race to the bottom, which gives you more maneuverability in surfing, versus actually working on some of the footwork and the other technical aspects of the game on a board that you can manage   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    josh waitzkin   and it's very interesting to think about this theme of the race to the bottom combined with this other wonderful principle that we were all talking about with eric which is the swapping of boards between   so he had these camps where, i think, the 18 top stand up paddle surfers in the world together, with him, all riding these ridiculously small boards that are deep underwater when you're standing on them and it's incredibly hard to balance on these things  so they've internalized this race to the bottom theme so deeply which we are working on  and then they had this experience where they were all together and, initially, it was competitive but then it became much more collaborative and they were just sharing ideas  and then they began to swap boards  and they began to have this interesting experience where every surfboard carved its own lines  there's the practitioner who carves his lines but then there's also the board that has a unique rocker or finds new lines in the wave  and what these guys would find is that, if they swapped boards, they could see new lines in the wave if they listened to the board  some guys would swap boards and try to force the new board to carve their lines  others would be open to what this new board could do  and then they would learn from it and then they'd go back to their board and their minds would open up  that's another way of thinking about this idea of the beginner's mind   the new board forced them   helped them   to see new lines if they were open minded enough  so, anyway, but this is an example of thematic interconnectedness  so when i came back from that   this was our previous trip where we were talking about the swapping boards theme   and i came back and i was red hot on fire with how to apply this theme in the investment process with my guys  so you have these teams that are so private and that are so magnificent at what they do  but, if you could get teams to mix   to share ideas with a sense of abundance   for example, if a world class portfolio manager could swap analysts with another pm for a week, or two, or three, wouldn't it be interesting if they were truly   everyone was sharing openly, you'd be doing equivalent swapping boards, seeing new lines  it's forcing a beginner's mind but forcing a beginner's mind not only with an open mindedness but also tapping somebody who is truly exceptional at a very different style of what you do  so there's an example of just having an experience in surfing and applying it to something else   tim ferriss   and converting it, potentially, into a simple question, right? like, ""where can i swap boards?""  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    josh waitzkin   right   tim ferriss   that could be something that is used for fodder for people listening in a journaling exercise   josh waitzkin   right   tim ferriss   wake up, have your coffee   or i was going to say have your coffee and then meditate   probably not the right order  meditate, have your coffee, sit down, drop that question at the top and just    josh waitzkin   ""where can i swap boards?"" beautiful   tim ferriss   exactly   josh waitzkin   that's a magnificent journaling brainstorm question to riff on  i love it   tim ferriss   so how do you apply that to education?  josh waitzkin   so this thematic interconnectedness, i don't think that we can do much more important work with children than help them love learning, help them learn to bring out the essence of who they are in the learning process   so to express the core of who they are through learning which obviously will help them love learning   and then help them discover thematic interconnectedness   how the world is interconnected via principles, themes  people are really siloed right now  people think about disciplines in an increasingly data driven    tim ferriss   segregated way?  josh waitzkin   segregated way   in a close minded way and it's kind of heartbreaking  and so i have this non profit i've been running for a lot of years and a huge amount of what we do   so all of our work is in education  we have hundreds of programs around the world, mostly in the us but international, as well  theartoflearningproject org is our website  and the programs that are most exciting to me are the ones where we really are systematically working with schools to help children experience thematic interconnectedness  and so the way we'll do this, for example, is we'll be working with five teachers in five different subject matters   or four, or five, or six, or three, whatever the  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    number is   in the same age group  what are you smiling at, man? what are you thinking? you have this great look on your face  tim ferriss   i'm sorry  i was just smiling because   sorry, guys  i was just looking at the url as theartoflearningproject org and i was laughing because i remembered when we were filming the tv show and we were walking up the stairs to the jiu jitsu   to the marcelo garcia gym   and you kept on saying, ""tal this,"" ""tal that,"" and i thought you were saying, ""towel, t o w e l,"" and i'm like, ""what the fuck is towel?"" and you're like, ""it's my goddamned book,"" and you got all upset  and i'm like, ""oh, the art of learning "" i'm like, ""how did you expect me to piece that together?"" anyway, that's why i was smirking  sorry, man   josh waitzkin   alright   tim ferriss   now i know the acronym and i know it well  i won't anger josh any further   josh waitzkin   you didn't anger me   tim ferriss   i know  i'm just fucking with you   josh waitzkin   so, anyway, the   i don't remember that conversation  i'm trying to place that   tim ferriss   it was great  ""tal, tal, tal    for five flights of stairs  i'm like, ""what the fuck are you talking about?"" anyway, my bad   josh waitzkin   so the way that we do this is that we have, for example, five teachers in different subject matters working with my team to weave the same principle of learning into, for example, math, english, history, social studies, volleyball, soccer at the same time  so you'll have kids who are studying their subject matter but they're studying also the way a certain principle of learning or the creative process of performance that calls you manifests in each of these disciplines at the same time  so they're, by definition, breaking down the walls between these different pursuits  and it's a really interesting, systematic way of doing this  so they'll be studying the same principle in math and they move to the next subject and they're experiencing it through another lens, and then through another lens, and they're experiencing it in sport   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   are these borrowed from ""the art of learning"" book insomuch as you're talking about smaller and smaller circles  you're talking about learning the macro from the micro, etc   josh waitzkin   yes, the root of these are in core themes of learning creativity and performance psychology that i wrote about in my book and that i've developed since  yeah, absolutely  and we've spoken about a lot of them together   tim ferriss   yeah   josh waitzkin   and so it's a combination of individualized self expression   well, a lot of these themes that we've been discussing today and last time   tim ferriss   and so can people theartoflearningproject org?  josh waitzkin   they can  so we invite everybody   please come check out the site  we've got some really wonderful programs around the world and it's a good time for this right now because i'd love it if any educators out there    learn  more  about  this  at  we're on the verge of launching about ten really high level program is what we want to launch   all thematically driven   right now, preparing them in the next months  and so anyone who is in the educational world who'd love to touch base with us about applying for this kind of program, katy on my team can be reached at katy   k a t y   at jwfoundation com  jw foundation is the name of my non profit that houses the art of learning project  so katy tim ferriss   katy   k a t y      as in joshua waitzkin   foundation com   josh waitzkin   yes  and she will     crosstalk  tim ferriss   what type of educators should check this out and email her?  josh waitzkin   teachers or people running schools or school systems   tim ferriss   any minimum number of students or any other parameters?  josh waitzkin   well, the essence of these programs would be a school system that's open minded around, for example, engaging   like i  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    described   teachers in different disciplines working at the same time in a collaborative way so that the kids can be embodying the same principle in multiple disciplines at the same time  and that's the essence of it  so it's a bit of a coordinated program  we've had wonderful success doing this  and that's what really excites me when i think about education   how to build systematic training in creativity through thematic interconnectedness into the way kids learn these days because kids get so excited when they can see connections  this is a big part of what i'm experiencing as a dad with jack is how red hot he gets when he can learn something and then apply it to many other things  and this is a core part of my approach of learning and i think it's maybe my biggest strength is the ability to find hidden harmonies between disparate parts of life tim ferriss   seemingly disparate   josh waitzkin   yeah  seemingly  right   tim ferriss   well, josh, this is always so much fun to drag you, kicking and screaming, out of your cage   josh waitzkin   you did it  or cave   tim ferriss   or cave   josh waitzkin   i like cave more   tim ferriss   i like cave more  i don't know why i was thinking cage  i guess that's just my inner primate coming out  but the people have asked me often about education following my ted talk where, at the end, i close out talking about tackling different facets education  and i feel like your approach and principle based lens through which you can not only spot, but teach interconnectedness, is just so incredibly valuable  like you said, in an educational system where fields are increasingly siloed and viewed as separate   and you have political turf wars between departments and what not which only exacerbates the problem   i feel like this is a massively powerful step in the right direction  so, no  1, thank you for that and, no  2, educators listening to this   or if you're just curious to check it out and might be able to help in some way   theartoflearningproject org   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and then, if you get a taste of that and it seems compelling and you want to try to apply or jump into the fray, then katy   k a ty    josh waitzkin   dot org   tim ferriss   oh, sorry   josh waitzkin   my bad  you're right   tim ferriss   theartoflearningproject org  and i'll put this in my notes for everybody listening  these will be   and many of the other things we've mentioned   will be in the show notes at fourhourworkweek com podcasts  but, josh, i would usually ask where can people find you online but they can't find you   josh waitzkin   they can't find me   tim ferriss   so i won't ask that  is there anything that you would like people to   besides visiting the resources we just mentioned   is there anything that you'd like people to take away, consider, do, any action   anything that comes to mind that you'd like people to walk away with just as a closing comment or question?  josh waitzkin   that's a big question  yes  absolutely  it's funny  as i sit with this now, for so many years, my primary identity was a fighter, a competitor, and i've transitioned in recent years and i find my primary self identity   the way i experience myself   is as a nurturer of people   my family, the people i work very closely with, and children as i work more broadly in education  and when i think about it through the context of nurturing people and nurturing ourselves, i think that we're living in a world of so much noise and so much distraction and space being constantly filled  it's rather remarkable what can happen if we cultivate a mindfulness   a stillness of the waters   as a way of life and we find the beauty in that  and there's so much beauty that can come from silence  we can learn so much by feeling the inner ripples of our internal experience  and as parents embodying what we want our children to embody   living it, walking the talk, putting away our phones  living a life of deep presence with our children, with our students, with the people we work with   cultivating empathy, cultivating compassion  it scares the hell out of me how powerfully i see the world moving in another direction from this and there's so much that we can learn  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    from the speed of what computers can do   of where ai is headed, of what big data can reveal  it's thrilling to me as long as we stay in touch with the essential parts of our humanity  and when i experience what happens working with people   with adults or with children   when we're just completely present and we cultivate that presence as a way of life, it's incredible what can happen between people  and when i experience the scars in children that i see everywhere, they come from the anxiety that comes from the lack of attachment   secure attachment   the lack of the attunement of the parent, the lack of the embodiment of the parent or the teacher and these things that are spoken about  it's heartbreaking  so maybe i'm really, really old school but there's something about the cultivation of deep presence and quality as a way of life which just rings all through me  and, honestly, the other thing i'll say is, after having the experience i had a few months ago   coming as close as you can to dying as you can, basically   first of all, on a tactical level, please, if anyone's experimenting with different forms of breath hold work like the wim hof method   which i think is very interesting and quite powerful   please don't do it in any water, even an inch of water because, if you go out, you don't want to be in water  and then   tim ferriss   i should say, if you practice this stuff enough and you're a type a personality, you are going to go out  it's not just a high probability  it's almost a certainty that you're going to go out and to think otherwise is really courting disaster  so do not do it in or near water   josh waitzkin   yeah  and when we talk about firewalking   about learning from other people's experiences with the same physiological intensity you can learn from your own   there's something about when you go over that edge, over that cliff   if i could take the experience of love, gratitude, beauty that i've been living with ever since i've had that experience and i could give it to my brothers and sisters, holy smokes, what a beautiful thing  and so if there's any way that we can just live with that deep sense of beauty, ah, that's a rich place   tim ferriss   to find the stillness to cultivate   not just find but create that stillness and practice, like you said, the calming of the waters  i think it's underestimated because of its perceived simplicity  and just as not all things are simple are easy, not all things that are  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    simple are low in value  sometimes, what's right in front of you within grasp that is most important to grasp onto and make use of  josh waitzkin   yeah   tim ferriss   it doesn't have to be extremely esoteric   josh waitzkin   and it's so easy to think we've got it nailed  we can meditate for 15 years and think we've got presence nailed and then we stop meditating and six months pass and we're distracted  there's a constancy to it   tim ferriss   yeah   josh waitzkin   there's a real sense of danger that we can slip   tim ferriss   and, speaking for me, personally, it's also building it in as a habit just like brushing your teeth   for those people who brush their teeth  insomuch as, for me   and i know this is true for many of my friends   meditation doesn't really work well as a badged process  in other words, meditating ten minutes a day for ten days is much more valuable than meditating once in ten days for 100 minutes  and, for most people, it would be less painful  too, once you get into the habit and it becomes an ingrained part of your being and your practice, you will see the value, particularly once you have a critical mass  for me, it's typically five to seven days and then i'm just like, ""i cannot believe i wasn't doing this  i can't believe i stopped for four weeks or whatever it is "" it's incredibly valuable  and, brother josh    josh waitzkin   thanks, brother  it was a blast, man   tim ferriss   thanks, buddy   copyright   2007 2018

196,204,Josh Waitzkin Distilled (#204),"'you can find it on barnesandnoble com, amazon com, everybody  they should be available  it s also a highlight reel, in effect, that you guys   many of you, thousands of you   have asked me for  we re going to invite back one of my favorite people on the planet, josh waitzkin  he s an endlessly fascinating guy ''josh waitzkin   you can find him at joshwaitzkin com   was the basis for the book and the movie, searching for bobby fischer  he was considered a chess prodigy, but he has perfected learning strategies that be applied to anything by anyone  i really mean that  including his loves of brazilian jiu jitsu (he s a black belt under   i think he was the first black belt under phenom marcelo garcia  we ll talk more about him) and tai chi push hands, in which he was a world champion ''these days, he spends his time very quietly coaching the world s top athletes and investors, working to revolutionize education (we ve partnered on a number of things there) and tackling his new passion of paddle surfing (in the latter, very often nearly killing me in the process)  i first met josh after reading his book   the art of learning  as i think i ve mentioned, we ve become very dear friends ''male speaker  empty space  josh has no social media, does no interviews   except for my podcast, for which he very often says to me or texts me,  you fuck! ''after all, he s from new york city  he avoids nearly all meetings and phone calls  he is perhaps the best i ve met (actually, there s one other   rick rubin, who s been on the podcast as well   legendary music producer)  he minimizes input to maximize output  as josh would say,  i cultivate empty space as a way of life for the creative process   so you might ask yourself how are you creating empty space? how are you creating the slack necessary to connect dots that perhaps you haven t connected before or come up with original ideas? josh is an expert here ''josh waitzkin  i cultivate empty space as a way of life for the creative process ''male speaker  learning the macro from the micro  josh really focuses on depth over breadth in everything  he often uses a principle nicknamed,  learning the macro from the micro   this means focusing on something very small in a field, whether that s in chess, martial arts or elsewhere, to internalize extremely powerful macro principles that apply everywhere ''i ll give you a few examples  this is also sometimes combined with beginning with the end game  i will illustrate that  for instance, when josh gave me a beginner s tutorial on chess, he didn t start with opening moves  memorizing openings is natural, of course, and nearly everyone does it  but josh likens it to stealing the test answers from a teacher  you re not learning principles or strategies  you re merely learning a few tricks that will help you beat your novice friends  instead, josh took me in the complete reverse, just as his first teacher, bruce pandolfini, did with him ''so he took off all of the pieces   empty board   and he added three back in an end game scenario, where he would usually finish the game  king and pawn against king  so in this case, through the micro   positions of vastly reduced complexity   he was able to force me to focus on the macro ''principles like the power of empty space, opposition or setting an opponent up for zugzwang, which is a situation where any moves he makes will destroy his position  so by limiting me to a few simple pieces, he hoped that i would learn something limitless   high level concepts that i could apply anytime against anyone  i ve seen josh do this himself to many things, including, for instance, jiu jitsu, where he can cover near all the principles of jiu jitsu, the main tenets that will help you compete at a high level, by focusing on a single submission and the end game called, in this case, the guillotine or specifically, the  marcelotine,  from marcelo garcia ''after he gave me this tutorial in chess (part of it was recorded and there s an extended scene that s available in the tv show i did called  the tim ferriss experiment), i went to washington square park and lasted about ten times longer than i ever have before competing against these street hustlers ''that was literally from practicing no openers, no nothing aside from these high level principles with three pieces on the board  pretty cool stuff ''male speaker  if you re studying my game, you re entering my game  josh and i spent a lot of time discussing and, in some cases, hanging out with or training with marcelo garcia  five time world champion in brazilian jiu jitsu, with whom josh owns the marcelo garcia academy in new york city, which i highly recommend if you have a chance  they have a very strict, no asshole, no bully policy  it s probably also the cleanest and certainly one of the most competitive jiu jitsu gyms in the world  marcelo   who s marcelo? marcelo is arguably the best grappler of the last hundred years ''he s considered the combined mike tyson, wayne gretzky and michael jordan of his sport  whereas most competitors are very secretive about their training for competition, their competition prep, marcelo does the opposite  he routinely records and uploads his exact sparring sessions ''in other words, his exact training for major events, which all of his competitors can watch  josh explains the rationale ''josh waitzkin  when he was competing in abu dhabi s submission grappling world championship and mundials, which is the brazilian jiu jitsu world championship, we were streaming his sparring sessions every night  so he was basically showing his competitors what he was about to use against them in two weeks and three weeks and four weeks  his attitude about this was just completely unique, is if you re studying my game, you re entering my game and i ll be better at it than you  i often share exact, under the hood details of how, for instance, i ve built the podcast or put together kickstarter campaigns and so on  i do this really for two reasons  they re reflective of two core beliefs  so let s talk about those  belief no  1  it s rarely a zero sum game  in other words, if someone wins, someone else must lose  that s just not the case  it s rarely a zero sum game in something like podcasting ''the more that i help people with details, the more details help i receive in turn  belief no  2  if it is competitive, i m simply offering people the details of my game, right? my attention to detail will scare off half of the people right off the bat who would have tried  so now we re down to 50 percent of the people who have heard it or read it or observed it  40 percent will try it and be worse than me because it s my game, right? i m capitalizing on my strengths with my particular strategies and so on  but 10 percent will try it be better than me  now, is this a problem or is it not?''i would just say  see belief no  1  that 10 percent will often reach out to me to teach me exactly what they learned and did to get better results because they are grateful for what i offered in the first place, which was transparency  so call it karma, call it anything you might like  i call it very, very useful and plus, it s just a more offensive and not defensive way to live and to perform in a professional arena for me ''male speaker  remember the last three turns ''josh waitzkin  i remember when i went skiing with billy kidd, who you might recall is one of the great downhill racers back in the  60s, the olympic ski team  awesome dude  now he skis out in colorado wearing a cowboy hat  just a timeless guy, brilliant dude  he was saying to me years ago, when i first skied with him,  josh, what do you think are the three most important turns of the ski run?  i ve asked that question to a lot of people since  most people will say,  the middle because it s the hardest, the beginning because they re getting momentum  ''billy describes the three most important turns of a ski run are the last three before you got in the lift  it s a very, very subtle point  for those of you who are skiers, you know that s when the slope is leveled off, there s less challenge  most people are very sloppy then  they re taking the weight off the muscles they ve been using  they have bad form  the problem with that is that on the lift ride up, unconsciously, you re internalizing bad body mechanics ''as billy points out, if your last three turns are precise, then what you re internalizing on the lift ride up is precision  so i carry this on to the guys who i train in the finance world, for example  ending the work day with very high quality, which opens up   for one thing, you re internalizing quality overnight  thanks to josh, i now always end training sessions on a good rep, per se  whether that s acroyoga (you can definitely learn more about that by listening to my episode with jason nemer), gymnastics (check out coach sommer), archery or other  for instance, even if i have 60 minutes budgeted for a workout, if i hit a fantastic pr, in other words, a personal record at say 45 minutes, or do something new particularly well in gymnastics, i pack it in  that s the end of the workout  in the case of archery, which is a new passion of mine, i always use what s called blank bale practice  a bale like a hay bale (they would use that you would put a target on and aim for) ''a blank bale is where i start and end all sessions with five to six arrows shot by feel alone  eyes closed, into a target that is a mere ten feet away  so i m not aiming at anything  this is similar in many senses, to dry firing with firearms or handguns, for instance, to try to minimize any type of flinching that you might have in anticipation of the shot  you re able to then kinesthetically incorporate the fine motor control that will ultimately aid you in other circumstances ''one of josh s favorite writers, hemingway, had a practice of ending his writing sessions mid flow and mid sentence  this way, he knew exactly where to start the next day and he could reliably both end and start his sessions with confidence ''male speaker  to turn it on, learn to turn it off and vice versa ''josh waitzkin  marcelo garcia, who we were talking about, one of my most beautiful memories of him and world championships, right before going into the semi finals   inaudible  ''everyone s screaming, yelling  he s sleeping  sleeping in the bleachers  you d wake him up  he d sort of stumble into the ring  you ve never seen a guy more relaxed before going into a world championship fight  then he can turn it off so deeply, and man, when he goes in the ring, you can t turn it on with any more intensity than he can  his ability to turn it off is directly aligned with how intensely he can turn it on  so training people to do this, have stress and recovery, undulation throughout their day ''male speaker  the little things are the big things ''josh waitzkin  we re talking about marcelo talking about embodying the principle of quality  in all these little ways   these little ways you could say don t matter, but they add up to matter hugely  i think the little things are the big things, right?''josh waitzkin  yeah  because they re a reflection   i mean, this might sound clich , but it s like how you do anything is how you do everything ''josh waitzkin  it s such a beautiful, incredible principle  most people think they can wait around for the big moments to turn it on  but if you don t cultivate turning it on as a way of life in the little moments   and there s hundreds more times little moments than big   then there s no chance in the big moments ''male speaker  just go around for life ''josh waitzkin  lateral thinking or thematic thinking   the ability to take a lesson from one thing and transfer it over   i think is one of the most important disciplines that any of us can cultivate or ways of being  it s something that jack and i have, from a really young age, we began to cultivate this from when he was really small around this principle of  go around   the first time it happened, he was really tiny  we were in a little cottage on martha s vineyard, a tiny little cottage in a big field  he was trying to get in one door and he couldn t, but he could get in the other door  i said,  jack, go around   he looked at me and then he went around  and then  go around  became a language for us physically  if you can t go one way, you go around, turn another way  but then it became a language for us in terms of solving puzzles and in terms of anytime you run into an obstacle, go around ''then working with the metaphor of go around opened up this way that we would just have dialogue around connecting things  taking a principle from one thing and applying it to something else  we ve had a lot of fun with that ''male speaker  embrace your funk ''josh waitzkin  that s a term my buddy, graham, who s a dear friend of ours who comes on our surf adventures with us  he s a brilliant thought partner   embrace the funk   could you explain that?''josh waitzkin  yeah, we have to embrace our funk  we have to figure out what   you think about the entanglement of genius and madness or brilliance and eccentricity  understanding that entanglement is always a precursor to working with anybody who s trying to be world class at something, because that entanglement is fundamental to their being  they have to ultimately embrace their funk  embrace their eccentricity  embrace what makes them different and then build on it ''male speaker  who do you pick when your ego seems threatened?''josh waitzkin  it s very interesting to observe who the top competitors pick out when they re five rounds into the sparring sessions and they re completely gassed  the ones who are on the steepest growth curve look for the hardest guy there, the one who will beat them up or who might beat them up  while others will look for someone they can take a break on ''male speaker  the importance of language on a rainy day ''josh waitzkin  one of the biggest mistakes that i observed in the first year of jack s life or year or two of jack s life that i observed with parents is that they have this language around weather  weather being good or bad  whenever it was raining, they d be like, it s bad weather  you d hear moms, babysitters, dads talk about if it s bad weather, we can t go out or if it s good weather, we can go out  so that means that somehow we re externally reliant on conditions being perfect in order to be able to go out and have a good time  so jack and i never missed a single storm  every rain storm ''i don t think we ve missed one storm, other than one maybe when he was sick  but i don t think we ve missed a single storm, rain or snow, going outside and romping in it  we developed this language around how beautiful it was  so now whenever there s a rainy day, jack says,  look, da da  it s such a beautiful rainy day   and we go out and we play in it ''i wanted him to have this internal locus of control  to not be reliant on external conditions being just so '"
367,375,Josh Waitzkin — How to Cram 2 Months of Learning into 1 Day (#375),"'watch the interview on youtube ''    thank you all for sitting around after a bio break to listen to a conversation i m about to have with my good friend, josh  thank you, graham, for having us  i m going to jump into it  i usually use a much more embarrassing intro for josh when we re recording something in private, so i ll use something a little less embarrassing ''josh waitzkin has perfected learning strategies that can be applied to anything, which i ve seen him do many times  including his loves of chess, brazilian jiu jitsu  he s a black belt, under a phenom and multiple time world champion marcelo garcia  tai chi push hands  he s been a world champion, and now paddle surfing and foiling ''josh spends his time coaching many of the world s top performers in many different fields, and he is the author of the art of learning  please welcome to the stage, josh waitzkin ''josh waitzkin  all right! hey, everybody  all right  let s get to it, shall we?''josh waitzkin  that song was my trigger song for the 2004 world championship and tai chi push hands, and graham thought it ll be fun to jerk up my physiology walking out  it s amazing how well it works  i just hear two bars of that song and i m ready to fight like 10 dudes  so here we are  pick  em out! anybody volunteering?''josh waitzkin  i listened to that in the three months of training camp for the world s during the competition  and then between the finals and the sudden death playoff of the world s, which was the wildest state of my life maybe  it has a powerful triggering impact  you are really a master of triggers and cues and systems  you, more than perhaps anyone i know, has spent a high percentage of your life in what i think people here and in what i would consider the zone  you said something to me yesterday when we were catching up a bit, which was, you feel like you ve been cramming two months of learning into each day recently  which sounds incredible, sounds almost unbelievable, especially knowing you as well as i know you because it s not like you just sit around watching paint dry all day  why and how is that? how could that be?''josh waitzkin  yeah, my training recently has been super exciting  i fell in love with surfing a few years ago, and really took it on, all in, but i was living in new york city, so it was difficult  i had to figure out how to take on surfing in a really intense way living here  the first thing i did is i hadn t spent a life skateboarding or snowboarding or going sideways, forward at all ''the first thing i did is i got a onewheel electronic skateboard with a big wheel in the middle  it s an amazing invention  that s how i started getting around new york city  i spent about a year and a half, maybe 2,300 miles of onewheeling 20, 25 miles an hour through new york traffic, which was a lot of fun  had some amazing wipeouts  but that was how i just initially just got used to burning in the experience of being in surf stance and moving forward  it was really powerful ''a year and a half ago, my wife was game and moved my family down to my favorite place on earth, beautiful place in latin america where the jungle meets the pacific ocean  took on stand up paddle surfing and foil training all in  initially just stand up paddle surfing, and recently it s been boiling  this past fall, so late august, september, i fell in love with foiling, and that s when things really went to overdrive for me  i ve been using this invention called the efoil  so foiling, i want you to imagine a five foot surfboard with a 29 and a half inch mast going down, and there s a wing ''when you re in wave energy or you re moving forward quickly, all that s in the water is the wing  it s frictionless, it s way faster than surfing, it s incredibly intense  graham asked me to put together a little video  this was from a few days ago  just so you can see what foiling is  you see that the board is above the water  this is in one of my favorite spots  you re going 25, 30 miles an hour  the wing is all that s touching the surface and it s a crazy, intense feeling ''but this device i m using, an efoil is really incredible  it s made with this company called lift  the guy, nick, who runs it is a real pioneer in the foil world  he s built this thing called a folding prop  what i m using is entering the wave under power as a propeller  but then once in wave energy, the propeller folds and i m just foiling as if just purely wave energy  it opens up as the possibility of entering waves under power as if you re being towed in by jet ski ''this moment is hairy, because if   after the entry   this wave catches you, when it s near wipeout and then adjusting back up, if the white water catches you, it s like getting shot out of a cannon and then you re on top of a guillotine  you have to dial in the break falls, like with onewheeling ''what s been interesting is opposed to having two to four minutes of wave time a session surfing, i ll have 54 minutes or so of wave time at faster speeds  what s interesting is it also opens up the ability to do deliberate practice in surfing  similar to investing, you have to be really creative in how you create deliberate practice in the surf world because the ocean is so unpredictable  it s really difficult to replicate sections, to hit the same thing 10, 15, 20 times  in martial arts, you can just say,  i m going to drill this thing 30 times today,  or 100 times or 200 times  whether it s a throw, or a technique, a submission  and then you can try that in training ''in surfing, it s very difficult to replicate the same condition once, even a couple of times in a few months  foiling is really interesting is the efoil allows me to enter the wave, and then the prop folds in and i m just foiling the wave  i m 20 to 30 xing the amount of wave time per session  but it also allows me to do really interesting things with deliberate practice  like for example, when you re under speed on a foil and you go over a big boil and you re in a big wave  a boil is like a huge upsurge of water pressure  if it hits the wing or hits one side of the wing, you get catapulted out of control ''most people, if they re foiling, you don t have many chances to train at boils, and when they happen, it s just catastrophic  it s a massive wipeout  now, i did two sessions where i went over 200 boils at top speed  it s doing tons of reps of boils or tons of steep sections  the learning curve is incredible ''it feels physiologically like between one and two months of training per session  afterwards, i feel like i have to lie in a dark room with my eyes closed for 10, 15 minutes, just to process  the brain feels like it was plugged into the matrix  it s really intense  the foiling is at the cutting edge of the surf world and the efoiling with folding props is like the tip of the tip of the spear  it s really powerful to feel what the brain feels like doing that and how fast learning curve can be  i love it  and how well the brain responds to intentional, well structured practice  one thing i ve observed with you since we met eons ago, in these different disciplines, is how well you think about, in a sense, the micro practice, like per session, let s call it the mezzo practice maybe on a weekly basis, and then the macro practice  how that then can evolve and be programmed over many months  we re going to get into how people can structure their days, how you structure your day  but what i d love to ask you about is perhaps to reiterate a story that you ve told me before that relates to deliberate practice and skiing  i don t know if you know what i m referring to  but the most important portion of a run, the most important run when skiing  do you know what i m referring to?''josh waitzkin  yeah, way back in the day i had some fun days skiing with billy kidd, who was just a brilliant olympic champion many decades ago  he asked me,  what were the three most important turns of the ski run?  it s an interesting question to sit with  because most people will think it s the middle where it s most intense, most speed or the beginning to get your rhythm  he talks about the last three turns before you get on the lift  which is where most people are sloppy, most people lift up, their body mechanic relaxes ''but the thing is, the last returns are what you re going to be internalizing unconsciously on the lift ride up  it s true with martial arts training my whole life, always finishing strong, always executing a technique very well  whether it s reps drilling or a strong sparring session or foiling, surfing, always finishing strong so that the last thing you do is what s going to probably burn into you most deeply overnight ''so harnessing unconscious learning is a huge part of what i do and what i train people to do  that s something i think it s really important to be deliberate about  another thing you re really good at is making the subconscious the unconscious or just the hidden, conscious  a big part of your learning, as i observe it, is mastering feedback and measurement  before we get to how people can structure things, because this informs it, what types of biomarkers do you track in your coaching clients? because i think it s very common for people to think of say chess as a mental pursuit  to think of something like foiling as predominantly or jiu jitsu, especially as a physical pursuit  but that s really a false separation  what type of biomarkers do you track on your coaching clients? whether they re in the investment world or elsewhere?''josh waitzkin  i have experimented with a lot over the past decade  what i ve come to focus on most deeply is heart rate variability  i have a brilliant hrv specialist, dr  leah lagos on my team who works really closely with all of my teams  she does hrv training   if i m working with a team of top decision makers, for example   with everyone on the team, ideally ''hrv is a really powerful way of training someone to get into a state of deep concentration, relax, deep concentration away from stress very quickly  and then tracking people s hrv, tracking people s sleep patterns  we, of course, also track nutritional patterns, physical training patterns ''for me, it s really interesting to just   i don t like bringing technology out into the water very much, but from time to time i do and just track wave time, heart rate in different situations  i had a really interesting period a month and a half ago where i was foiling this big wave that i ve discovered an offshore reef break  it s sort of like a non stop drop  it just keeps on going  it mounts up and then you re just accelerating for 30 seconds straight ''your body has this innate physiological it feels like an evolutionary response to bail out, because you re going so fast, you re accelerating and your body wants to jump out  i started doing hrv breathing to my resonant frequency while accelerating down this wave  can you just explain what that means to your resonant frequency, what does that mean?''josh waitzkin  everyone has a unique resonant frequency  if you re doing heart rate variability breathing, and you re breathing to your resonant frequency, it ll maximum to your unique frequency in your physiology  it will have the biggest impact in raising alpha waves, relaxing your body, moving you from a stress state to a deep state of relaxation ''the ideal way to train hrv is to work with a brilliant specialist and find out what your frequency is and then do breath work 20 minutes twice a day at that rhythm  over time, it s incredible what it can do  you get to a place where you can just take a breath and be in resonance  i did a lot of meditation work for years before this, and lot of trigger work before this  with hrv, i found that   what was that?''josh waitzkin  trigger work  trigger work, what s that?''josh waitzkin  trigger work would be essentially using something like a song, like lose yourself, eminem song  one thing i started doing decades ago would be getting myself into a peak performance state and then attaching a trigger to it, like a song or a scent  so then ultimately, i could, as i was doing a 30 minute or 40 minute routine, which i might have had to do back in the chess days, being able to listen to a couple of beats of a song or smell something or take a breath and enter into a peak performance state ''i learned this lesson from a lot of years in competition where you can t predict when you re actually going to have to fight  i remember going to a world championship in 2000 when i knew i was going to   long story we have not discussed before  but long story short, i thought i would have a 30 minute warning before i competed, and then   this is in a world championship in taiwan   everything changed  i was eating lunch and then they changed the rhythm and i had to compete like one minute later ''it really taught me i had to learn how to enter a peak performance state with a breath, instantly  hrv is really powerful  i ve been playing with it in this steep wave  it s fascinating how quickly it takes me from the state of needing to bail to just complete calm while making that steep drop  then your baseline rises and then you can keep on just getting acclimatized in more intense conditions  what type of tools do you use for tracking these days   hrv, that is? do you have a preferred tool for  ''josh waitzkin  dr  lagos has experimented with a lot of things  that s her terrain  i ve played with a lot of different tools  i haven t actually found it to be perfectly frank, the software that i think is a    i m thinking about building some of my own  but i don t at this point feel like there s the ideal peak performance training hrv software out there, for a bunch of reasons  nothing has exactly what i want  so people can diy the search for a tool as a stopgap measure might help  but let s translate it to say the world of investing  how would someone use their hrv to inform how they plan their day, for instance? might they, like an athlete, wake up and look at their hrv and their sleep patterns and say,  wow, i am not recovered (whatever that means)  i m going to defer   to the extent possible   important decisions for today   or would they use it to, like you said, track if they are in a sympathetic fight or flight state, and then moderate that before taking a particular phone call or whatever it might be? how do you take that data and translate it into the world of say, investing?''josh waitzkin  the way i personally relate to biofeedback or any kind of technological tool is to use it to train my own somatic ability to feel where i am  i don t personally want people to become dependent on technology  i want them to use technology to develop the ability to feel  i started meditating when i was 18 years old  it s very difficult to have feedback than in the meditation process  someone might start thinking for eight or 10 minutes whether they realize they re thinking ''one thing that s really great about using biofeedback is that you ll have something tell you that you re starting to slip in your focus  but ultimately, from my perspective, the idea is to train your intuition, your somatic introspection, to feel when your quality of presence, your quality of energy is slipping from like a 10 to a nine  when i start working with people with top mental performers, very often, it can go from a 10 to a two before they even feel the slip ''really, i like to use these tools to train someone to sharpen their intuition, to sharpen their somatic sense, for where they really are  and then, for me personally, in my training, that s what i go with  i go with how i feel  chess for example, you have to make so many decisions, and your physiological state is always changing  you can t take a break and take a look at what the machine tells you how you re doing  but you can use the machine to train your ability to feel where you are ''for investors or programmed decision makers, chess players, poker players, anyone who s in a really high stakes, intense, time sensitive discipline, you want to have the ability to feel where your performance data is, and adjust it on your own independently  this is so important  i m glad we ended up exploring this because it applies to a lot  it really applies to a lot  i ve seen this in, for instance, the exploration of dietary ketosis, and using devices like the precision xtra during times when it doesn t matter  let s just say on weekends or during vacations so you re able to see that   i won t get into ketosis right now  you guys can look it up   but it s very interesting for a number of reasons  you realize,  oh, at 0 5 millimolars on this device, i feel like this  and then at 1 5 millimolars, i feel like this  ''you get to a point where you re no longer dependent on the device, and you have that sensitivity, so that you can say,  you know what? i m feeling cranky  i m probably not yet working off of fat, and i m a low blood sugar  probably shouldn t send that really sensitive email right now because i ll be doing damage control for the next week   how do you think about structuring a performer s day? you could give examples from any field, but how should someone think about that? because you are, to me, and as a job, i guess, interview top performers in different fields  you are so exceptional at focusing and crafting your days and weeks and months in a way that you can focus  what suggestions or examples might you describe for people who are looking to better structure their days?''josh waitzkin  yes, it s a really important question  first thing i ll say is that everything that i do in a coaching capacity is individualized  the essence of what i   if i m working with someone who is a world class decision maker in some realm, by definition, i have to know them so intimately before i start making suggestions to what they do  because i think that the entanglement of genius and eccentricity or brilliance and badness is so complex and so critical for people who are in the top 0 1 percent or so of what they re doing ''there are so many dysfunctional habits that i ve seen drive brilliant creations, and then there are so many people who are doing things by the book who are just mediocre  that s one initial caveat that i ll say is that if i m training somebody one on one, i will understand them with tremendous nuance before i ll start tweaking what they re doing ''that said, there are some core principles around their architecture that i think are really important and that are really challenging to embody in this technological age where everyone is distracted, everyone is just constant inputs  everyone s so busy, everyone feels that they should be so busy, everyone s pulled into the external all the time  people find it very challenging to structure the days or do what they want to do, because of an internal relationship to their creative process, as opposed to how it will look from the outside ''i think that a proactive day architecture versus a reactive one is hugely important  i think most people will have lots of meetings scheduled and then maybe they ll try to jam thinking in between the meetings  so they ll have like two minutes of thinking time in between, which is, from my perspective, disastrous because people, their brilliance comes from thinking ''i ll block out thinking time in someone s calendar, and then meetings we ll put in between this  and alignment of peak energy periods with the creativity work, thinking time is hugely important  usually, it s the reverse, people will do their thinking on the walk back from lunch when they re a little bit lethargic as opposed to doing their thing first, when they wake up in the morning when their energy and their creativity is most intense  how do people identify their peak energy?''josh waitzkin  they can feel it  in my diagnostic process, i find pretty consistently people are right  i ask people to rate one through 10 how their energy levels and creative state is in different parts of the day  and then of course, i examine it  but people tend to have a pretty good sense for this  i think it s really important  one of the things that i have every one do   and that i ve been doing my whole life   is ending my day thinking about the most important question in what i do  then waking up in the morning, first thing, pre input, and brainstorming on it ''this is an incredibly powerful tool that i learned from my dad   who s a great writer   in his creative process when i was seven or eight years old  hemingway wrote about it in his writing process  it s been a huge part of my life for decades  ending the day strong, like i mentioned before, and focusing on what matters most and building the musculature of focusing your being on not all this ancillary stuff that just comes at you, but what really matters the most  releasing it, not stressing out a little about it all night, sleeping well  and then first in the morning pre input, not after checking the news or checking bloomberg or checking twitter or checking stock prices  pre input, brainstorming on it  because what you re doing that way is you re systematically opening the channel between the conscious and the unconscious mind  that s something that is something you can do it systematically, day in and day out rhythmically  so let s give a specific example  it could be a real world example from your life, it could be a hypothetical, it could be a composite  what time   give the example and when you would write it down  you put it at the top of a page in a notebook before dinner and then put it away? what does it concretely look like?''josh waitzkin  again, i think that the expression of it is individualized  some people will write it down on a piece of paper and write it down  some people will write it in their evernote and return to it  i wake up usually around 4 30  i journaled for many years physically, but then i had so many journals and it was so difficult to get through them  i actually now use evernote myself, and i just pop it open and start riffing on it ''this is something that you can   i use this term  making smaller circles, that initially when we do something, we do it in this big way, and then we can refine it and make the circles tighter and tighter and tighter in reference to in the martial arts, you learned about body mechanic and a big motion, and you learn to condense it and make it more and more potent ''this is the kind of thing that you can do at night, and then in the morning  but then ultimately, i think throughout the day, it s very important to do this  before you go to the bathroom, pose yourself a question  and then don t check your phone while walking to the bathroom  release your mind, and then come back from it  and then think about returning your mind to the question  because what you re doing this way is you re training your ability to focus on what matters most  this is what i call the miq, most important question ''i think that miq training is one of the most important things that a decision maker can do because the best way to train an analyst in a discipline is to train them in knowing where to look, what matters the most  there s a system that emerges from this day architecture, imagine the evening morning rhythm, and then three or four reps of it throughout the day  then imagine you have a team where you ve got a leader who stays at a higher level in a certain discipline, and you ve got a group of analysts beneath  if you have the system i call miq gap analysis   where everybody is doing this most important question training, initially one rep, but then multiple reps of the day   there s transparency throughout the team ''then there s a periodic review, you talked about feedback as a really powerful way to bring in the healthy feedback in an organization or in your own internal structure  there s a review of what you   if you re doing it on your own   what did you think miq was now and then a week later, two weeks later from this elevated perspective after you ve done much more work, what do you think the miq was? and then the gap is often where you ll devote your work ''in the team structure, you can have somebody overseeing the miqs of a group of analysts, and then sometimes tweaking it, sometimes making suggestions  and then team training, deliberate practice, can be focused on the gaps that emerge, where they become clear between what seemed like the most important question then and what later on it became apparent was the most important question  if we re looking at the most important questions, miq, does it tend to be something very specific?  how do we mitigate risk?  or  how can i mitigate risk in position x?  or whatever it might be? or are there when in doubt, or when unsure, are there other types of most important questions that people can ask? such as   i m not really even sure,  where might i be neglecting risk?  or something like that? are there broader questions that you find are very useful when someone isn t sure on a very specific level where to focus for a most important question? if someone s, say, struggling to come up with the miq?''josh waitzkin  i use this tool for big, thematic meta questions  i sometimes will use it for tactical questions  i ll use it sometimes to get a clear read on how i intuitively feel about somebody  i can ask myself,  do i intuitively feel that this is an ethical person?  or if someone is interviewing a leader of a company,  what s my intuition about the quality of his or her thinking?  or it can be a much more tactical question  it can be i study video of a surf or a foil session i had, then it might leave the whole question in my mind and just sleep on it and then emerge,  what s the biggest lesson to be taken out of this?  or i might look at one thing and drill in a very specific, technical idea and try to refine it ''i used to do this with theoretical opening questions in the chess world  where often, i would be stuck  most great thinkers, i find, are like a knife through butter through most things  but then there s one or two places they re stuck  those areas of stuckness are a really powerful place to focus this tool ''it s really breathtaking what happens  you just get into the rhythm of waking up with the solution and you get used to it  after you do this, you might have three or four times a day, the kind of crystallization, miraculous realizations in your creative process that you might have had once every two, three months, otherwise  you said letting go as part of this process  does that mean that in your case, i know it s individualized, but that you re not doing it right before bed, you re doing it earlier in the day? how do you do that?''josh waitzkin  it s not right before bed  that s a great point  hemingway used to end his writing session leaving something left to write  it was his version of it  like mid sentence or mid paragraph ''josh waitzkin  mid sentence, mid paragraph, mid theme, mid story, mid something  not being a writer who just writes everything, it s interesting to look at that idea through the internal versus external framing  sometimes people feel, because they feel guilty if they don t do everything they could possibly do, they finish, they blow it out, as opposed to hemingway always leaving something left  to go leaving a sense of direction activated and then he would drink wine, he would release, he would relax  maybe i would recommend meditating, working out, having a great night s sleep, listen to music, enjoy  don t stress out about the question all night  don t think about it in bed  then waking up first in the morning and then returning your mind to it ''you really are releasing your conscious mind from it  the art of letting go is a big one  i think it s one that people in this industry have not taken on as intensely as they should  this is an industry which people are on all the time, the constant inputs  people are on their phones all the time, people are listening to you while looking at their phones  it s learning to release that, to focus extremely deeply on what you re doing ''one more point  if you look at the greatest competitors in the world, the greatest physical like athletes, marcelo garcia, who i trained with for many years, who i own a jiu jitsu school with in the city, he s probably the greatest grappler to ever live  if you watch marcelo in a world championship, he would be sleeping literally minutes before a mundials semi final or final, sleeping  but you ve never seen anyone turn on more intensely ''if you look at great fighters, people think fighters are like jacked, intense, but they re not  they re actually very relaxed  the greatest fighters are super relaxed when they re not fighting  but when they re in the battle, you wouldn t believe the intensity  even to deconstruct that further, if you watch a great, for example, boxer, the relaxation before a strike is delivered is incredible  there s the undulation, most people in high stress, decision making industries are always operating at this kind of simmering six, or four, as opposed to the undulation between just deep relaxation and being at a 10 ''being at a 10 is like millions of times better than being at a six  it s just in a different universe  same as being all in on a discipline is millions of times more intense than being 98 percent or 99 percent, let alone  i can take it or leave it   just having observed you, observed marcelo, certainly heard stories about say, floyd mayweather before gigantic fights, i heard a friend of mine who knows him said he walked into his dressing room after floyd  he was like,  yeah, sure, come on   he s like,  i don t want to interrupt you  you must be prepping   he s like,  no, i m either ready or i m not   he was just sitting down watching some tv  it s, in a way, your ability to avoid the simmering six directly affects your ability to then ratchet up to turn on to the 99 percent or the 100 percent  if you re always at a simmering six, you re just at 50 percent battery all the time ''josh waitzkin  100 percent  and at 50 percent intensity, you have no idea what your 10 is  you have, as you mentioned earlier, moved to latin america  i was convinced, as someone born and bred here, i thought the waitzkin clan, like a group of hobbits, was just going to live in this little corner of manhattan forever   as long as the human race would survive  yet you ve moved to a very remote location, and you have in many areas, now in a very clear way, created a lot of slack and white space for deep work ''how would you sell that? not necessarily moving to the jungle, but how would you train or how do you train some of your performers to stay away from the siren song of fomo, fear of missing out? the temptation to distraction? because you re very good at deliberately blocking it out  what do you say to people who are tethered to phones, locked in front of a bloomberg, who have trouble creating those broader blocks of time?''josh waitzkin  well, the art of saying no, which you and i have spoken about a lot, is a really important one to take on  in my life today, i m training as intensely as i ve ever trained  the goal is virtuosity, not a world championship, but i m training as intensely as if i was training for a world championship  my ocean training is maxed out intensity, four, five hours a day  i love the work that i do with my core partnerships in the decision making space ''it s really beautiful to feel how my game in all of it has risen as i ve moved away from everything  i think i was pretty good at saying no before living in new york, but new york is just so much incoming  now, i m so far away  this has been a principle that i ve cultivated for many years, that i feel like i ve only begun to see the potency of in the past couple of years, since i ve experienced the power of the empty space ''so much of what we re trying to do as idea generators is get away from the thought constructs, the group think, the group biases where everyone is clustered  it s really interesting to get away from it all  for me, coming into new york city, i ve lived much of my life in new york  but now coming into new york city after not having been here for three, four months, and living in a place which is just so different   i m listening to monkeys and ocean sounds and rain falling   it s amazing how much i feel here that i didn t feel before  because living in the city, you have to close down a lot of your pores because of the ambulance sounds, the technology, just the constant noise ''so, living here, you have to shut a lot down  it s very interesting if you open your pores getting away from it, and coming in, how much more receptive you are  i think it s true mentally with ideas  i think that if you get away from a lot of the noise, it s much easier to take that 30,000 foot view and see what really matters, and see the core patterns that are operating  it s like that idea, that great david foster wallace discussion around, this is water, built around the metaphor of a fish swimming in water doesn t know what water is  it s very important to see what our water is  i think getting away   or structuring a day   meditation is an incredible powerful internal tool for cultivating this if you re meditating 30 minutes or an hour in the morning and then again later on  i have some dear friends in this industry who are  it s like that, it s like moving to the jungle in some sense  you have the ability to just see through so much of the crap and focus on what matters most  what matters most   we don t have a whole lot of time left, but your ability to determine what matters most is affected by your ability to identify your zone of genius in a way, right?''josh waitzkin  yeah  that also your excitement about or predilection to go from zero to 100 is also dependent on operating in your zone of genius  you ve been very, very good at that  how do you suggest, or do you have any words of wisdom for people who are trying to determine in their world   whether that s sports, investment, you can pick one, or to be general   how they determine where that zone of genius is?''josh waitzkin  yeah  it s a great question  i wrote the art of learning 15 years ago, and i just started writing again recently  it s been beautiful to re enter that terrain  a lot of what i ve been starting is this question of  why self expression?  because a lot of what i m writing about is a life of how to live a life of self expression, which is what you re asking about  and then,  why self expression?  and then,  how do we get there? ''i think that learning who you are as a learner is incredibly difficult  i think, obviously, it s great to have an ecosystem around you that can help you understand it  if you ve got people who can really take you for who you are, as opposed to putting their own constructs on you, which is very difficult  because people are trying to justify their own decisions  so they re trying to box you into those ''there s so many frames in order to understand who we are  are we a visual kinesthetic or auditory processor? most people don t even ask this question  do you love mountains or ocean or city? do you like the rain? do you like to control things or let things rip in a more relaxed way? what are the patterns behind your greatest successes, and what are the patterns behind you biggest errors?''i like to look at that personally, professionally, technically, and psychologically  in other words, breaking down the boundaries between your personal life and your professional life, and looking at things both in terms of technical specific errors and brilliant creations and more thematic and psychological kind of meta manifestations of that tactical example ''what are the things that have driven our greatest insights, and what are the things that have locked us up most in life? and understand those, and look at the seeds of each one  this is a big part of what i do in my work  i think it s so important to be patient with this process  i think it s very easy for people to follow the mental models of others or follow the paths of others  that s usually disastrous  from my perspective, the goal is unobstructed self expression  first, we have to understand what self expression is and who we are as a learner  we have to embrace every little element of our funk and build around it ''i tell you, it s such a beautiful thing that happens  i think that a big part of being all in on something and falling in love with something so deeply that you re eating it, you re breathing it, you re sleeping it, you wake up in the morning wanting to do it, you want to train at it, being just on fire, stoked out of your mind on the thing, is feeling like you re expressing yourself through what you re doing ''if you were a writer, or a chess player, or you re writing books and doing brilliant podcasts like yourself, if you feel like you re expressing the core of your being through what you re doing, then it s beautiful  if you feel like you re living in someone else s model, or even if i m taking on an art like surfing and i m doing it in a way that someone else tells me to do it versus a way that expresses the core of my being, it s a different world ''it s not so easy to get to know ourselves  but i think the art of introspection, psychologically, somatically is one of the most important that we can take on  i just want to thank you personally  we re out of time, but for helping me to take the snow globe of life and death to put it down long enough to let it settle so that you can see more  i think that s one, i wouldn t say a gift that you have mean  it is a gift in a sense, but it s a talent and a skill you ve developed  it s like putting the snow globe down long enough so that you can see through it  thank you for making the time, coming out of your reclusive jungle habitat, and sharing with us today ''josh waitzkin  thank you man  i want to thank graham duncan, who s co chairing this with a dear friend of mine  i ve been observing this event for so many years  it s just an important cause  i think it s awesome what you guys are doing  graham, much love, man  all right  thanks, everyone!''josh waitzkin  thank you, guys!'"
263,270,"Investing Wisdom from Marc Andreessen, Peter Thiel, Reid Hoffman, Chris Sacca, and Others (#270)","'after nearly 300 of these conversations, you or i start to spot patterns   at least, common skills  i sometimes like to put together themed episodes that pull the best advice and tidbits from one particular area   in this case, investing   from multiple geniuses and top of the heap competitors  so, this episode contains some of the best lessons i ve come across related to investing   or, more generally speaking, making money, growing your personal wealth, et cetera ''and, if you look at the best investors   whether that is for their personal finances, or, say, fund finances   and, these are two very different things that i ll mention briefly   you ll notice that the frameworks they use to make decisions have to be very refined, and this is often the case for, say, poker phenoms as well, which is why i like to look at people who appear to be gamblers who are, in fact, investors  they re very good at resource allocation and thinking through asymmetrical reward   capped downside, but potentially, near limitless upside, et cetera   and how they make those decisions ''so, whether or not you re interested in investing, the thinking systems represented by the people you re going to hear from are very valuable and can be applied to rational decision making so you are less emotionally reactive ''okay   a few caveats  1)  i am not an investment advisor or professional  i do not play one on the internet  so, what works for me may not work for you  talk to your registered, qualified, professional financial people and consult a common sense specialist before doing anything really stupid, please ''you need to create systems and procedures that work for you, and your risk tolerance is probably very different from the people you ll hear from  nonetheless, you re going to hear from people who i consider to be some of the smartest investors on the planet, including billionaires, legends from the world of finance, and so on ''part of what sparked me to put this together was the popularity of a recent episode, which was an interview i did with ray dalio  ray dalio has been called the steve jobs of investing, and he is the founder and i supposed you could talk along the lines of  manager    i think he s currently the cio   of the world s largest hedge fund, bridgewater associates, with  160 billion under management  if you want to hear that, which catalyzed this, you can listen to that separately at tim blog ray  it was a super popular episode, so you can check that out ''but, ray does not appear in this one  instead, we have a different cast of characters  so, coming up, i talk to marc andreesen  marc is the cofounder of andreesen horowitz, one of the most successful venture capital firms in the world  marc also co created the highly influential mosaic internet browser, and he cofounded netscape, cofounded loud cloud, which sold to hewlett packard for a cool  1 6 billion  he s rightly considered one of the founding fathers of the modern web ''marc andreessen  and then, the other thing we have in venture is when we make a decision, we then become committed to that company in that category, so we can t invest in their competitors, including their competitors that don t even exist yet  then, we have my friend and super angel investor   also a venture capital investor   chris sacca, who shares some of his wisdom as it relates to investing ''chris sacca  i only get involved in deals where i know i can personally impact the outcome  i also talk to the so called   and, he doesn t call himself this, but other people do    oracle of silicon valley,  reid hoffman, one of the nicest guys you will ever meet  reid is the cofounder and executive chairman of linkedin  he was previously executive vice president at paypal, which was purchased by ebay for  1 5 billion ''reid hoffman  the reason why companies frequently rise and fall is because they learned to play one game, they got good at it, and then the marketplace changed  now, it s a new kind of game, and you have to adjust to playing that new game  that s actually part of recognizing when a strategy applies  next up, i speak with peter thiel, a name that has certainly had a lot of buzz in the last few years  he s one of the cofounders of paypal and the first outside investor in facebook ''peter thiel  but, i think the fundamental philosophical question of,  what do people agree merely by convention, and what is the truth?  finally, i speak with seth godin, who is a fantastic reality check whenever i m confused by something that perhaps i m optimizing from a mathematical standpoint  he never fails to deliver a lot of very powerful common sense advice that is not common at all  in fact, it s usually something that should be obvious, but is hidden in plain sight, and so, i rely on him a lot for good advice  he s one of the best marketing minds in the world  he s crafted an incredible life for himself  he s the author of 18 bestselling books at last count  what you might not know is that he s also founded several companies ''seth godin  once you have enough for beans and rice, and taking care of your family, and a few other things, money is a story  so, without further ado, let s get started, and i ll kick it off with just a few comments and precautionary notes  no  1 is that anything i mention is going to be  your miles may vary,  meaning that investing   allocating resources, making decisions   depends a lot on very highly personalized factors ''i should also draw a distinction between personal finances   so, you might ask someone who has  10,000 00 in the bank,  100,000 00 in the bank,  1 million in the bank or more, how they would create a portfolio for their personal finances with that capital  that is a very different question than,  how do you invest risk capital?  or  how do you invest in high risk, high potential return asset classes? ''many of the people you re going to hear from have both personal finances, of course, but they also manage funds, and the economics and mathematics of funds are such that the risks are contained because  for instance, in a venture capital fund   how does that work? the way venture capital works   and, i m going to oversimply this is the interests of time   you say,  i want to create a venture capital fund  ''so, tim ferriss decides he wants to create a venture capital fund, and i want to invest in blockchain and cryptocurrency related companies  that s not something i m doing, but let s just say that s the case  it s a highly speculative   and in some cases, high risk   asset class  i don t want to risk all of my money doing this, but i know people who want to participate in cryptocurrency ''so, i m going to go talk to sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, or groups that have endowments   for instance, for universities   who have a percentage that is put to the side for venture capital or something even higher risk as a capitalization  i go to them and say,  i have this unique approach to finding very promising blockchain companies, and here s my investment thesis   i show them a fancy powerpoint and hopefully convince them to give me money  this is not my money  i may have some of my own money in the fund, but not necessarily ''and then, what happens is i have, say,  30 million from these assorted folks  those are my limited partners  i am the  owner  of the venture capital firm, so i m the general partner  i could have other general partners  and, in the most primitive terms possible, i will probably have what s called a 2 and 20 structure  so, what this means is for the money that i have in a given fund   i raised  30 million for ferriss crypto 1   i will get a 2 percent management fee based on my assets under management ''it s a little more complicated than that, but for the sake of simplicity, let s say i get 2 percent of that  30 million if it s all deployed into investments each year  and then, you get a 20 percent profit share, effectively  so, if that  30 million becomes  60 million, i get 20 percent of that  30 million upside, or  6 million ''you can see how, as you start to raise bigger funds that are  100 million,  500 million, and then you re raising a new fund every few years, how the numbers get very big if you are good  now, the important point here is not the structure of venture capital funds  if you re interested in that, i highly recommend a book called venture deals  there s also one called zero gravity that goes into venture capital works  but, it is to point out that the way you will invest other people s money in high risk asset classes is not generally how you are going to invest all of your personal finances ''so, many of the folks that you will hear from are operating from a fund basis   that is what they are known for   and they don t discuss their personal finances publicly  so, i will give you a personal finances example with the express understanding that it does not mean you should mimic it ''but, i have found that as a heuristic, it s very helpful for me to think of my investing   to use a term from nassim taleb, who wrote the black swan and fooled by randomness   as barbell investing  this means that if you look at the risk profile of different investments from extremely low risk   and, maybe in another podcast, we ll come back and talk about different ways to define risk   so, that could be treasury bills, cash, or any number of things ''all the way to the far right, you have extremely high risk investing  that could be certain types of currency  it could certainly be early stage startups and so on  i then have a barbell representation in terms of capital allocation  that means that i m putting the vast majority of what i have into extremely conservative investments ''for many people, that might be low cost index funds, for instance, whether that s through a service like wealthfront, which i am involved with as an investor myself   in the company itself, that is   or vanguard, or dimensional funds  and then, i go all the way to the other end, and i also invest   with a cap   a small percentage of my liquid net worth in highly speculative but potentially high return startups ''i only do that in this barbell distribution because i have advantages, and i would not recommend that anyone invest in higher risk asset classes   meaning there is a 20 to 50 percent chance that you will go to zero in that particular investment ''those are somewhat arbitrary numbers, but not that far off if you assume that at least 3 out of 5 startups you invest in are probably going to go to zero or be the walking dead for a period of time before having a soft landing where the company gets bought for a nominal sum, and because you invested early, you re not in line in such a way that you get any return, et cetera ''so, just assume that when you re on the far right side of the barbell, you re putting in money that you can afford to lose that will not negatively impact your lifestyle one iota if it goes to zero  that is the rationale, or at least the mentality you have to have  in such cases, you should not play in said sandbox unless you have   and, this is only one of many advantages you could have   an informational advantage, which i have after 17 years in silicon valley where i know people who know a lot of things, so i have an information flow advantage ''then, you could have an analytical advantage, which renaissance   which is a hedge fund   might have  that s very quantitative  you could have a behavioral advantage, which i don t think i have  case in point  i m a very bad public equities investor  warren buffett would have an emotional or behavioral advantage insofar as he and charlie munger appear to have little to no emotional response to what they would call  mr  market,  but the up and down fluctuations, which can sometimes be wild and cause people to sell at the wrong time or buy at the wrong time ''i have found i m particularly sensitive to selling at the wrong time  so, for anything that would present itself as a handicap, given that weakness i ve identified in myself, i should let someone else make the decisions, or automate it with low cost index funds of some type ''so, those are the prefacing statements  sorry it took a little longer than expected, but those were all very important to cover before we get into the nitty gritty  so, find what works for yourself, ignore what doesn t, create what is uniquely your own, but do not risk what you can t afford to lose  while the barbell approach, for instance, has been very helpful for me, it is not appropriate for many people out there listening  all right, let s get to the rest ''marc andreesen,  on twitter, is a legendary figure in silicon valley and worldwide  even in the epicenter of tech, it s very hard to find a more fascinating icon  like i said, he s considered to be one of the founding fathers of the modern web internet, which makes him one of the few humans to create software categories used by more than a billion people   multiple software companies ''marc is now a cofounder and general partner of the vc firm andreesen horowitz, where he has quickly become one of the most influential and dominant tech investors in the world ''you see a lot of people who change their mind almost too frequently with inconsequential facts  how do you think about advising a company that s struggling as to whether they should stay the course or pivot, as they would say?''marc andreessen  so, we see both cases   well, failure cases  we see companies that are   this fail fast thing is completely out of hand  i m old fashioned  i come from  people like to succeed   i like to say that before this word  pivot,  we didn t have   when i was a founder, when i first started out, we didn t have the word  pivot   we didn t have a fancy word for it  we just called it a fuckup ''i m old fashioned on this  i like to succeed  i think succeeding should be the goal, not failing, and certainly not failing fast, slow, or any other form of failing  so, i get really cranked up about this  but, we do see companies where, literally, every time we meet them, they ve pivoted  every time i meet them, they re off to something new  it s like watching a rabbit go through a maze  they re never going to converge on anything because they re never going to put the time into actually figuring it out and getting it right ''but then, you do see the other case, and this is where the fail fast thing from  you see the case where people are absolutely determined   will just pound their head against the same wall for years and years  you admire them for their determination, but at a certain point, it just becomes obstinance, and then, at some point, it becomes self destructiveness  it becomes don quixote  you re tilting against windmills arbitrarily ''so, those are poles  we do see behavior at the poles  the question you re asking is, of course, the key question, which is what s in the middle? how do you know? frankly, i don t think there s an answer to that   or, the answer is judgment  i think that s the test ''basically, i think there are a couple key tests for founders   or investors, for that matter   in these kinds of decisions  i think that s one of the really core tests  do you fundamentally have the judgment to make that call, knowing that either way could be the big mistake? nobody s going to tell you   you re not going to get any confirmation from anybody that you made the right call  if you change and succeed, that s great, but by the way, you might have succeeded at the old thing even better  if you change and fail, you ll never know whether the old thing would have worked ''in science, they call it the counterfactual  you never know the counterfactual  the way my brain is wired, i m always thinking in terms of the counterfactual, so i m always thinking of the way things could have been  the world evolved in a certain way as a consequence of people making all these decisions on the fly  people could have very easily made a different set of decisions  the world could have ended up in a very different place ''and so, the idea that you re ever going to know the consequence of your decision is probably a fallacy   or, what the alternative would have been, the relative result of your decision  and so, i just think you basically have to fall back on judgment, and you have to fall back on some sense of the intangibles  when you re looking to stress test ideas and, when we look at it in the case of a partner meeting here   so, you mentioned hedge fund managers, and i read a profile of ray dalio from bridgewater capital at one point, and they talked about his meetings, and how they stress test ideas, and how people defend ideas   how does a good partner meeting go? if someone proposes a substantial investment, what happens from that point to a yes or no decision?''marc andreessen  so, a hedge fund manager can reverse himself  if he makes a bad trade, the next day, he can turn around and take the opposite trade  we don t get to do that  so, when we invest, it s knowing that we re in for ten plus years  that s our basic assumption  by the way, when we make an investment decision, it s a commitment of dollars  it s also a commitment of somebody s time, and the organization s time and bandwidth, and there s only so much of that ''and then, the other thing we have in venture is that when we make a decision, we become committed to that company in that category, so we can t invest in their competitors, including their competitors that don t even exist yet  for example, the investors in friendster were more likely than not completely   maybe unwilling but also unable to invest in facebook when it came on because they were conflicted  the founder of friendster would have said,  you can t invest in a competitive company  ''and so, our decisions are big decisions, and they have serious consequences for the future of the firm  so, on the one hand, it s very important to us to have a full discussion, get all the facts on the table, and really vet these things out  on the other hand, we re trying to preserve the contrarianism that s at the core of what we do, the strong non consensus views  we re trying to be able to invest in things that are unusual and odd that other people aren t taking seriously ''one of our theories about venture capital is that  so, everybody thinks that in investing, you either make a good investment or a bad investment  i actually think that s not the big issue  i think the issue   at least in venture capital   is whether you make a good investment or a great investment, and i think good is the enemy of great ''we see many companies that are just fine  the founders are good, and the market seems good, the product seems good, the customers kind of like it, they get a little revenue, and it s all fine  but, those companies tend never to go anywhere ''every once in a while, we ll see these companies that have are extremely strong, that have this special, wonderful thing going on that may have all kinds of problems and issues, but there s something at the core of what it is that s really special and magical  those are the ones that we re trying to do  we re trying to stock our portfolio with just investments like that ''so, to capture that, you can t have   it would be very easy, in a conversation about the weakness of something, to beat the idea to death, and you never invest  so, the rule that we have   and then, you would only invest in the consensus ones  you would only invest in the very good ones as opposed to the great ones, and then you would fail as a firm  so, we have to get both things at the same time  we have to try really hard to encourage the strong non consensus thinking, but also have the full discussion to make sure that we really stress test that thinking ''so, the way we do it is that each of our gps has the ability to pull the trigger on a deal without a vote or without consensus, and what we say is if the person closest to the deal has a very strong degree of positive commitment and enthusiasm about it, then we should do that investment even if everybody else in the room thinks this is the stupidest thing they ve ever heard of ''however, you don t get to just go do that completely on your own without stress testing your own thinking, so it s the responsibility of everybody else in the room to stress test the thinking  if necessary, we create a red team  we ll formally create the countervailing force, and we ll designate some set of people to counterargue the other side  it s like a debate team ''marc andreessen     yeah, basically  and then, the way that we try to   and, this is fraught with all kinds of ways this can go wrong  what if i bring a deal, or if ben brings a deal, or the new person brings in a deal? what ben and i try to do is do this to each other  whenever he brings in a deal, i just beat the shit out of it  i may think it s the best idea i ve ever heard, and i ll just trash the crap out of it and try to get everybody else to pile on ''and then, at the end of it, if he s still pounding the table, saying,  no, no, this is the thing,  then we all say,  okay, we re all in  we re all behind you   it s a disagreeing commit kind of culture  by the way, he does the same thing to me  it s the torture test  what are some of the keys to fighting well? it seems key to many different types of relationships   personal, business, or otherwise   the ability to resolve conflicts, or just fight well and make up  so, it seems like you and ben have   not my words   fought like cats and dogs, but you always get over it ''marc andreessen  we prefer  old married couple    old married couple!  there is a story   i don t know if it s accurate   about netscape s early days and something related to an interview with a journalist  do you know the story i m talking about?''marc andreessen  it s in ben s book  oh, right  so, here we go  ''marc andreessen  including the email you re about to reference  so, could you describe this for people who are unfamiliar?''marc andreessen  i really think you   for that, you have to read ben s book  let s just say we started out our relationship with vigorous disagreement, and we ve continued that to this day  but, how do you  ''marc andreessen  this is a family podcast  i don t want to use   oh, it s not a family podcast ''marc andreessen  if you want all the bad words, read ben s book, the hard thing about hard things  it s in the book  i ll put it in the show notes  how do you   you guys got off to a very aggressive start  how did you identify that ben was someone worth having those types of disputes with, that there was a value in what he brought to the table, as opposed to just another person that you were butting heads with who was not worth keeping at the table?''marc andreessen     honestly, there were three things  one is that he would talk back to me and argue right back at me  he wouldn t just go into the fetal position?''marc andreessen  he wouldn t just roll over  he would argue right back  a lot of what   if you just observe a lot of companies or investment firms over time, there s a temptation for everything to become a hierarchy, and then people have trepidations about speaking truth to power ''a lot of what i ve always found that the wise and smart leaders are trying to do is find the people in the organization who will talk back  it s one of the ways to get ahead  there are certain organizations where the way to get ahead is to talk back to the leadership  that s how you get noticed  there are other organizations where that doesn t work at all, and i would recommend getting out of those as fast as possible ''we try to be   at, least ben and i want to be   the organization where people will speak truth to power and argue back at us, just like anybody else, which is why he and i argue so much  we want to set the model, set the precedent ''so, that was one, that he would talk back to me  the second is that he was often, if not always, right  i wouldn t say  always  because nobody is, but he was very smart and had very clear thinking  the third thing is that i saw early on that he was amazing working with people, which is not something that i think has ever necessarily been true of me, but he was just   watching him in front of a group of people was routinely magical in terms of how he could communicate people in a very clear way and how he could be very fact based, but make people feel in a fundamental way  and so, that combination made it clear that he was somebody very special  chris sacca,  on twitter, s a c c a, is a billionaire founder of one of the most successful venture capital funds in history  it may end up the most successful in history  it is called lowercase capital, and you can think on that for a second  it took me a while to figure out why that was so funny, which is embarrassing to admit  he s an early stage investor in many companies that have exploded, including twitter, uber, instagram, kickstarter, and many more ''in this segment, we specifically discuss how chris chooses founders and investments, what differentiates wall street from silicon valley investors, and total immersion theory ''chris sacca  the total immersion thing is like a religion  when you get it, you get it  i went from dragging my ass around the pool, kicking too hard and paddling too hard, to   when total immersion hit me, i could suddenly swim a couple miles and get bored  so, i was just there as an apostle  when you were like,  i m struggling with swimming,  i was just geeking out  in the same way you can get going on lifting techniques and stuff like that, i m like,  you re in my world right now  i m going to talk about swimming  ''but, the same with the investing stuff  i was really lucky that when it came time for me to get started as an investor, i had many guys there paying it forward and teaching me about the game   guys like josh kopelman at first round, tony conrad at true ventures   really being generous with their time and helping me figure out what was going on  the guys at industry ventures were indispensable for me   hans swildens and his team ''and so, for me, when you came along and started asking questions about that, not only did i feel like i was paying it forward again, but it in the same way that you and i never invest in a simple idea   the execution is everything   i don t feel like i m really giving any secret away by telling you what the approach is  you still have to execute it, right?''so, i can give you my lens on how i think about this stuff things other people have taught me, and things that i think i might have improved upon, but i can lay that playbook on you, and if you re not good at this, you can t fake it  and so, i don t have any fear of disclosing my secrets to b teamers because they re not going to end up competing with me  in your case, you re good at it, so it s become an incredible side business for you in addition to everything you do with media  but, there s no fear in putting that stuff out there ''the other lesson they taught me is that if i get to you and teach you some of this stuff, you re going to naturally be an ally of mine in this industry  so, if i can get in there and teach you how i think about the world, how i can be helpful to companies, and you start using that same method, then we re going to end up doing deals together, and you and i have, and we ve made a fair amount of money doing that  so, i don t want to leave that unanswered  well, i it s been really fun to watch you evolve, grow, and experiment in investing  coming back   we can rewind the clock back to your upbringing a little later on, but since we re on the topic, what were some of the pieces of advice that you were given early on by the guys that you mentioned or other people that helped you to approach early stage investing in a more intelligent way?''chris sacca  a couple of guys have said things that i ve now taken in an amalgam and have codified  i have rules for investing now that were definitely influenced by a lot of these guys giving me advice and things that i ve now put to work  one is that i only get involved in deals where i know i can personally impact the outcome  now, there s no guarantee that i can take it from x to sold or x to ipo, but i need to know that i can have a material impact and make something more likely to succeed ''so, the second rule i ve developed   and, again, this has been influenced by guys along the way who have given me advice   is to start with something that s already great that you can make more awesome, but don t start with something shitty that you think you can make good  that s hard ''when you work in a company   and, i know a lot of your listeners work in big companies   you have to work on the shit that somebody hands you  so, you re dealt the 2 7, and you re like,  okay, that s what the boss gave me  i ve got to play this hand out  ''when you get into investing, your default stance should be  no,  because most deals suck  most deals won t make money  most companies will fail  when you see your first deal, your temptation is always,  i know i can be helpful to these guys  i know i can make this shitty thing better   and so, your first few deals are always the worst  that s how i lost  50,000 00 on my first deal, and i was just like,  ugh   it was 25 percent of what i had hypothetically allocated to two years  it was like,  oh, my god  ''chris sacca  it s because you get in that room, and you re like,  okay, i know how i can make this thing better,  and you forget that you need to start from something that s already independently pretty damn good, and then make it better ''so, our third principle is  give yourself a chance to get rich,  and that was something that was influenced more by all these fund investors who are like,  hey, it s all well and good to throw  25,000 00 around in some of these deals, but most of them won t be home runs  most of them won t turn into unicorns  most of them are going to require a ton of work  a bunch of those will fail, but a bunch of them will be successful to the tune of doubling that money, but over years and years of work  ''and so, i ve sold companies   i sold a company to amazon where i saw 3x on a  50,000 00 investment in a fund  by the time my fund got paid back, and i got my part back, and i had been busting my ass in that company for a couple of years, i barely had money left to buy the guys dinner to celebrate the deal ''so, that s another thing   leave yourself enough room to benefit from scale, going in at prices that are low enough that if the company is as successful as we think it s going to be, we ve given ourselves a chance to get rich ''and then, the fourth thing that we evolved internally   or, that i involved   is to be proud of every deal  there s stuff that i ve passed on that i don t regret at all  it seemed like a great way to make money, but i don t want to have to explain to my kids that that s how i made money  so, those are the guiding principles that have been shaped  categorically, what would some of those be?''chris sacca  mistyped domains  that s a great way to make money  people are stupid, and they mistype stuff all the time, and you can put ads on sites that don t really look like ads  subscription businesses that make it impossible for you to cancel your subscription   right, the forced fulfillment, forced continuity ''chris sacca  you can sign up online, but you need to send them a postcard to cancel   that kind of stuff  i see that stuff  people making unsubstantiated claims about the effectiveness of their stuff  this anonymous content stuff that is just going in bad places ''so, i just want to be really proud of our deals  those are some principles that have been shaped by a lot of these guys who have given me this advice along the way  when you meet with founders for the first time, what are   is there anything that disqualifies them quickly? are there certain red flags that you look for?''chris sacca  this has evolved over time  i have now been doing this for a while, and i ve done over 100 deals, and i ve seen a bunch of those work out, and i ve seen a bunch of them not work out  i read all the posts that my peers in the industry write, other vcs  everyone is constantly stabbing at,  what is the rule? how do you get into one of these meetings? ''so, let me have a couple of parameters first  one is that i almost only invest in things that are already live in production  no hypotheticals, no ideas  i think there might be one exception to that, and it was a particularly gifted entrepreneur that i d already worked with before, but other than that, we look for stuff that already has actual users, that can demonstrate that the team is capable of building and launching stuff together, and getting out there into the market ''that said, the one thing that will turn me off right now is if i see that in the pitch, the founder is trying to convince themself  if i can pick up on any hint that they don t believe in this story in their marrow, then it s no dice  as i look at all the most successful founders i ve backed, the thing they have is inevitability of success  there are no conditional statements coming out of their mouths  there s no,  well, if it works, it would be rad  ''instead, it s just always   you talked to kevin systrom at instagram when he was working on it himself  he was literally a sole guy working on a product, and he s like,  so, when we get to 50 million users, we ll roll out this other stuff,  and you re just like,  wait   he s peering into the future, looking through you into something in the future, and you re just like,  i ve got to go along for the ride with this guy  ''it s the same thing when you talk to evan williams  when it comes to talking about the likelihood of success of his products, he just knows  he just knew twitter would be a big thing  he knows medium will be a big thing  he doesn t need to convince you of that right now  he just knows  you talk to patrick and john collison at stripe, and of course, they re building for this thing to be a big, dominant company, and it just will be  you ve spent time with travis  you re an investor in uber  was there any doubt at any time that uber would dominate the planet? there s no doubt  can you share a   there s an anecdote   i think we ve probably talked about it over drinks at some point   the wii tennis ''chris sacca  travis and wii tennis? yeah  could you tell the story?''chris sacca  so, a few years ago, we were up at my house  we live up in the mountains in truckee  it was over the holidays, so my parents were there  i think it was actually new year s day  so, travis and i had been   we have a tradition up there  on new year s eve, we go snowshoeing at midnight and drink champagne out in the meadow, so i think we were pretty it was a pretty rough morning ''but, travis was sitting on the couch, and my dad sensed some weakness, and he challenged him to a game of wii tennis on the nintendo wii  my dad s not a bad player  he s pretty good  so, travis is like,  okay, mr  sacca, sure   he picks up the controller, and they play the first couple of games, and they re tight games, but travis wins them  my dad is there taking full swings with the paddle, breaking a little sweat, and travis is still a little blurry from the night before, barely breaking his wrist, and he s beating my dad, and my dad s like,  what the hell is this? ''and then, there was that inigo montoya moment, princess bride style, where travis turns to my dad and says,  i m sorry, but i m not left handed    i forget if it was left or right, but he switches hands at the controller, and the next three games, my dad never touches the ball  there were no points scored on any of travis  serves  my dad s like,  what the hell is going on? what is this? ''and, after the torture got to be too much, travis just says,  let me take you to the global leaderboard  i m sorry  i didn t mean to be holding out on you   he goes to the global leaderboard, and travis kalanick was ranked no  2 in the world at wii tennis  in his spare time ''chris sacca  now, uber was a thing then  literally he was already building a startup, but he s just so obsessive and competitive, and that s the thing  we look across the portfolio at all of the most kick ass companies  it s something they just have right up front  they re not hoping and praying for success  they know it s going to happen  what books or resources outside of personal relationships in these mentors that you ve had, the kopelmans and so on   are there any particular books or resources that have helped you become a better investor?''chris sacca  yeah, though i think most of those are not business books per se   perfect  that s great ''chris sacca    because so, i didn t get a business degree  i didn t do an mba  i took a couple of classes   enough to show me it was a total farce  i did get a law degree, which is an even bigger farce, but that s for another episode  so, i never had formal business training, and i tried to look at a few of those  instant mba  books and stuff like that  i even bought some books on venture capital, and they re just so goofy  by the way, part of that is because now, we have so many great venture capitalist bloggers who are an open book about the industry, who teach it ''brad feld comes to mind first   a longtime friend and mentor  brad      has done a series over the years where he breaks down each aspect of a term sheet, how to understand it, and the deal documents   these are the things we think are important, and these are the things we think could go away   josh kopelman and his team have done a lot of work on that ''we ve now seen why combinator and the guys at fenwick and west and coolie are building templated documents that are really watered down, and pro entrepreneur, and have taken out a lot of the legacy bullshit that didn t need to be in those documents  so, there s a lot of this learning that can happen now without having to buy books or go to school, so that s been fantastic ''but, where i worry about the valley and about investors as well as entrepreneurs is in the development of everything off the ball a little bit  as a 40 year old, the people my age who were computer science majors in college   that was a major just like any other major  they still had to go get a summer job  they mowed lawns and waited tables  they had time in their curriculum to study abroad or volunteer  they had these really well rounded lives ''and so, working with people my age and older at google who were computer scientists was great because they had not just these amazing math and science skills, but a diversity of experience that informed great product decisions as well as collegiality ''what ended up happening is that computer science degrees got so popular and so valuable that those kids didn t have to pay for school much anymore, and their only work experience was taing a class, not actually getting their ass kicked digging ditches or anything  the curriculum was rigorous enough that these guys didn t get to go study abroad, and there was no opportunity to do volunteer work and live in the developing world at all ''as a result, i found that we were starting to have a generation of not just entitled   people talk about the entitlement of millennials when it comes to work ethic, but they weren t just entitled  they had such narrow band perspectives on the world ''they were missing empathy, so they weren t able to put themselves in the shoes of the folks they might be building a product for or what the problems of the world might be  and so, i am constantly looking for opportunities for myself and for the founders we work with to broaden the scope that they have on the world such that they can build something on a more informed basis   an emotionally informed basis ''i really think empathy is a word that s been reduced to a signal   somebody hurt their foot and i feel bad for them   instead, i think   much more poignantly   empathy is about,  can i see the world through that person s lens? can i figure out what matters to them? what are they afraid of? what s bothering them? what do they think is limiting them right now? what s their hope?  if i can do that, then it s a lot easier to build something for them, sell it to them, help them, and build a longer term partnership with that person  reid hoffman   i ve mentioned him already    both on linkedin and twitter   is often referred to as  the oracle of silicon valley  because of his investing track record, which includes facebook, airbnb, flickr, and many more  noted venture capitalist david sze, whom many entrepreneurs i know love   he s incredible in his own right   says of reid,   he  is arguably the most successful angel investor in the past decade  ''as a quick step back, i talked about venture capitalists   angel investors are typically investing with their own ships, so they do not have a 2 and 20  they have a 0 and 100 split  no management fee, and 100 percent of the returns or the losses ''in this short conversation, you will learn how reid processes questions to make better investment decisions ''if you were giving advice to someone leaving stanford undergrad, and they had no gaming background, what would you recommend they do to try to develop strategic ability or thinking?''reid hoffman  there s a lot of different paths to it  most people think they re better at strategy than they are, and so, you really have to hold up a very clear   you have to have a very deep self awareness of,  am i, in fact, really good at it?  having an idea or saying   for example, you say,  well, i ll just do this  ''a real strategy is actually build off of what your competitors are doing, what their mindset is, what their assets are, how they re going to move, how you re going to move, what your edges are, what s the way you can make that work, how it is that when they re playing against you, you can still play to win ''so, games are a very good way to do that, and getting a lot of different exposure   not to computer games, because ai strategies are usually not that interesting   against other people is very useful  i think it s also useful to read some military strategy, which i did as a child   sun tzu, von clausewitz, other folks, more modern folks   and think about what the set of principles is when you re thinking about how to win a game that s in contention, in conflict ''and then, a lot of people also have some sports knowledge on this, too, although one of the things that s frequently a little limiting on sports is that the game that a person tends to   they tend to be like,  i play soccer  or  i play football  or  i play basketball,  and then they have a deep sense of what the strategy is there, but they haven t played enough different games in enough different circumstances ''it s like understanding,  what happens if i change these four rules in basketball?  how would you play the strategy now? that s the kind of thing, because most of the circumstances you find yourselves in, you have to figure out what the current game looks like and how you play it, and that s also the reason why company frequently rise and fall  they learned to play one game, they got good at it, the marketplace changed, and now it s a new kind of game, and you have to adjust to playing that new game  that s part of recognizing when a strategy applies  absolutely  i was just having a conversation with someone about the rise and fall of kodak yesterday, and of course, this is the disruptive theme that one encounters so much in silicon valley  i wasn t planning on asking this, but i d be so curious to hear  given your experience with regulatory risk and so on, what do you feel   if you have an opinion   uber has done well, and what could they have executed more effectively or strategically?''reid hoffman  what they ve done well is essentially quickly deploying their product so that it s clear that there s a bunch of people who are benefiting from it, both consumers and drivers, in various circumstances so that there s an ecosystem of people by which you go,  look, see? we can actually add a lot of positive to the system   i think that s been one of the things that they ve done most positively within it ''on the negative side, the company tends to be very combative, and when you think about the mental space in which regulators tend to operate, they tend to have gone into that job because they view themselves as protectors of important groups of society, whether they re consumers, workers, or other folks ''and so, they don t tend to respond very well   it s not a competitive game with them  it s not that you bulldoze through them or over them  what they want is to know that their concerns are being answered, and it s frustrating to the company because the regulators are being triggered by competitive interests like taxicab companies and other kinds of things which want the world to stay exactly as it is, which is not good for anyone   the way that we re going to run is the way we were running in the 1950s, and that s the way we re going to be running in 3000  ''that s obviously not a very good idea, so innovation and its pushback is frustrating, but nevertheless, when you re interfacing with regulators, you have to interface with them with the understanding that they may be conservative, they may be slow to change, they may be risk averse, but their goal is a mission of protecting society, so you should interface with them on that channel more than on the,  get out of my way  i m innovating  i ll treat you like i treat a competitor   that creates a lot of unnecessary friction  right  that makes sense  you are considered a company builder  you ve had an integral part in building some massive successes  but, you re also very well regarded as an investor, and i would love it if you could tell the story of getting introduced to mark zuckerberg, and how you decided to be one of the first investors in facebook ''reid hoffman  actually, i could have told you i was interested in investing in facebook even before mark zuckerberg  i tracked the product  i thought it was extremely well done  when i tracked it, he and his cofounders   dustin, chris, and others   were in boston, going to harvard, so as an angel investor, it was too much of a hassle  as a venture capitalist, i would have flown out there  as an angel, it was too much of a hassle ''and so, i went,  oh, that s cool,  and went back to it  and then, i got this call from sean parker, whom i d known from his work at plaxo, and as a good product inventor and good systems thinker on these things, and sean said,  i just met these really good guys   mark zuckerberg and others   who are doing this thing called facebook that i m joining, and it s really awesome  ''i m like,  oh, that s really cool  are you moving to boston?  he s like,  no, they re here   i m like,  oh, that s interesting   he s like,  yeah, and we re looking for an investor   i m like,  i would definitely like to meet with them  i m super interested in this   one of the things i said, which i think totally   even though it s been the most expensive economic decision i ve ever made in my life, but all in a good outcome ''i said,  when i led the series a in friendster, i got a lot of pushback on having my cake and eating it too because i don t see any conflict between friendster and linkedin  it generated all this stuff  part of having integrity and a high sense of ethics, but having done some work on appearing to have it  so, what i think we should do is have peter thiel lead the round and i ll follow, because then peter can be the board member, and even though i m super interested in this, i think that s probably the best thing to happen  ''and so, my very first meeting with zuckerberg was at peter thiel s office with sean, who i d known, and with zuck, and matt cohler was there as well  he was working for me at the time  that was our very first meeting  basically, the meeting was very confirmatory because we d already seen the product, already known the product was amazing, already seen it having traction, and what i learned from the meeting   which was hardly a surprise, especially now in retrospect   was that zuckerberg was extremely smart, very much a learning machine, very good at the evolution at technologies ''but, i was already more or less positive   if he d said,  i don t want to meet with you, but would you put in money? , i probably would have put in money anyway  right  what was mark pincus  role at that point, or his involvement with facebook?''reid hoffman  pincus had also known sean parker back from the napster days  pincus had done an early startup called freeloader  but, part of how mark got involved in the facebook investment was that separately, mark and i had bought a patent called the six degrees patent, which describes the viral expansion of a system ''again, on the x basis, i said,  look, mark and i are partners on this  we re actually trying to protect all these new web 2 0 viral companies  that s our principal goal in going and buying this patent  but, given that facebook is also in this, i should also split the investment with mark because basically, it s part of being a good partner with him   so, that s part of how mark   he had also known sean parker, and sean had talked to him about it as well, so there s a bunch of different things, but that s fundamentally how pincus also became a series a investor in facebook  peter thiel,  on twitter, has been involved with some of the most dynamic companies to emerge from silicon valley, both as a founder and investor  he also certainly has some fascinating stories related to gawker media and others, which we may talk about another time ''peter s first startup was paypal, which he cofounded in 1998 and led to a  1 5 billion acquisition by ebay in 2002  after ebay, peter founded clarion capital management, a global macro hedge fund  he s done so much  he s also launched palantir technologies, an analytical software company   i suppose that s an understatement   which now books more than  1 billion in revenue per year, and he serves as the chair of that company s board  peter has invested in more than 100 startups, he was the first outside investor in facebook, and he consistently questions assumptions, which allows him to think differently ''why do so many investors spray and pray instead of focusing on just five to seven companies in each fund, like you do at founder s fund? the second part of the question is do you have any rules that you follow, or tips for those who want to invest in early stage ventures more intelligently?''peter thiel  i think people would say that they spray and pray because of some sort of portfolio theory or diversification theory, and if that s true, that might work  i don t actually believe that to be true  i think the real reason people spray and pray in their investing is because they lack conviction, and perhaps because they re too lazy to spend the time to try to figure out what companies are ultimately going to work ''one of the reasons i do not like that sort of approach to investing is that i don t think it s good to treat companies as lottery tickets  i think it s terrible to treat the founders of companies as lottery tickets, and i think it s not just a bad moral thing to treat people as lottery tickets, i also think it s bad as an investor ''as an investor, once you say that there s a small probability of a big payoff   small number times big number normally equals a small number  so, once you re thinking in lottery ticket terms, you ve already psyched yourself into writing checks without thinking, and are therefore losing money ''and so, i think the anti lottery ticket approach is to try to be concentrated because that forces you to have high levels of conviction before you write a check of any size, and then i think you ll do much better  what does philosophy have to do with business, and how has your study of philosophy helped you in your investing and career today?''peter thiel  i m not sure how much the formal study of philosophy matters, but i think the fundamental philosophical question is one that s important for all of us, and it s always this question of,  what do people agree merely by convention, and what is the truth?  i think the fundamental distinction in a society is that there s a consensus of things that people believe to be true, and maybe the conventions are right, and maybe they re not  we never want to let convention be a shortcut for truth  we always need to ask,  is this true? ''this is always what i get at with this indirect question   tell me something that s true that very few people agree with you on   silicon valley is a place that is laden with conventional thinking, and one of the reasons that it may afflict silicon valley even more than the rest of our society is that there are so few markers ''one of the things we re focused on in silicon valley is the future, and the future is not always a clear thing  people can be uncertain about it, and when they re uncertain about the future, they will try to find shortcuts involving looking at what other people say about the future, and when everybody is simply listening to everybody else, that s the definition of a bubble or a mass psychosocial insanity  and so, i think this question of trying to think for yourself or break through convention is always important, but perhaps so even more in silicon valley than in most places  what do you think the future of education looks like?''peter thiel  i don t like the word  education  because it is such an extraordinary abstraction  i m very much in favor of  learning   i m very skeptical of credentialing or the abstraction called  education   so, there are all these granular questions  what is it that you re learning? why are you learning it? are you going to college because it s a four year party? is it a consumption decision? is it an investment decision, where you re investing in your future? is it insurance? or, is it a tournament where you re just beating other people, and are elite universities really like studio 54, where it s like an exclusive nightclub?''i think if we move beyond the education bubble that we re living in today, the future will be one in which people can speak about these things more clearly, and we will talk about whether it s an investment decision, a tournament, or a trade or vocational skill that you re developing ''i think engineering is the opposite of education because it s a specific skill that people are learning, and as a discipline, it cuts most against the banality that we re always told   you re learning how to learn, or you re not learning anything in particular, you don t know why you re learning things  engineering is the anti education in that sense, and i think in some ways, it s a paradigm for the way i think it will be more in the future ''i think we will have much less of a one size fits all approach  i think the big tract institutions are delivering less and less and charging more and more  and so, i think we are at a point where things will look very different ''one of my friends suggested that we are at a point in education that s like the place where the catholic church was on the eve of the reformation  it had become a very corrupt institution  it was charging more and more for indulgences  people though they could only get saved by going to the catholic church, just like people today believe that salvation involves getting a college diploma, and if you don t get a college diploma, you re going to go to hell ''i think my answer is in some ways like that of the reformers in the 16th century  it is the same disturbing answer, that you re going to figure out your salvation on your own  what are your daily habits and routines?''peter thiel  i always feel i m a terrible person answering that question, since things are very unstructured in many ways, but i d say that one thing i try to do every day is to have a conversation with some of the smartest people i know and continue to develop my thinking  so, i m trying to learn new things, i find that i learn them from other people, and it s often people with whom i ve had conversations for a long time ''so, it s not an mtb approach where you talk to a new smart person every day  it s one where you have sustained conversations with a group of friends or people you ve been working with for a long time, and you come back to thinking about some of these questions, and that s how i find i continue to learn every day and expand my thinking about the world  what one thing would you most like to change about yourself or improve on?''peter thiel  it s always hard to answer this since it begs the question of why i haven t already improved on it, but i would say that when i look back on my younger self, i was insanely competitive, and when you re very competitive, you get good at the thing you re competing with people on, but it comes at the expense of losing out on many other things  so, if you re a competitive chess player, you might get very good at chess, but neglect to develop other things because you re focused on beating your competitors rather than on doing something that s important or valuable ''and so, i ve become much more self aware over the years about the problematic nature of a lot of the competitions and rivalries that we get caught up in, and i would not pretend to have extricated myself from this altogether  so, i think it s something to reflect on every day, and think about,  how can i become less competitive in order to become more successful?  what did you want to achieve by writing zero to one?''peter thiel  when you write a book like this, you re trying to reach as broad an audience as possible  there s much that i ve learned in the last 15 years as both an entrepreneur and investor in the technology industry, and i wanted to share some of these lessons, not just at stanford, but also in silicon valley and with the wider world ''i think this question of technology is critical to our society in building a better future in the 21st century, and i think there s both an alarmist and a hopeful part of this book  the alarmist part is if we do not get our act together and innovate more, we will have a bleak and stagnant century ahead of us  on the other hand, the positive side is that there s absolutely nothing about  all the great ideas have been found   it s not the case that all the low hanging fruit has been picked ''there are a great deal of things that can be done and that people can achieve  there are many great secrets left to be unlocked in the decades ahead  and so, i think it s primarily a cultural question of what we need to do to get back to the future  seth godin, on twitter  i was having trouble with my  th   that part of english is hard, folks  have you ever noticed that, that a lot of other people speak other languages? anyway, seth godin has one of the most popular blogs in the world  you can find it by simply typing  seth  into google, and he will pop right up ''in 2013, seth was inducted into the direct marketing hall of fame  he has founded several companies, including yoyodyne and squidoo  he also turned the book publishing world on its ear by launching a series of four books via kickstarter  he s done a lot of experimenting in publishing, so i watch him very closely  that campaign reached its goal in just three hours and became the most successful book project   at least then   in kickstarter history ''what opportunities were you offered   it doesn t have to be specific   that you re glad you turned down? are there any particular examples that come to mind? if not, i can move on, but i m just curious if there are any opportunities that you ve turned down  for instance, one of mine would be every reality tv show i ve ever had  i m thrilled, and i was extremely tempted early on, but in retrospect, i m extremely happy i said no to all of that ''seth godin  yes  that s a great point  tv runs deep in our culture  they wanted me to be on that super famous one, and then that other one, and i never hesitated in saying no because that s the moment when you decide who you want to be  so, i paid extra careful attention to the question and extra careful attention to my answer, and it resonated ''i would say the biggest shift   which is, for silicon valley people, hard to get your arms around because there s a game being played there, and it s a game i ve opted out of   is when i was at yahoo during the renaissance in 1999, bill gross   who s a super nice guy   came to me and asked me to be head of marketing for the company he was building  it had steven spielberg on the board  it was teed up to be the seventh next ipo, and there were  1 billion in stock options on the table ''i said to myself,  well, if i say yes to this, i ve decided what i do for the rest of my life, which is say yes to the next one, because i don t need to say yes to this to buy cilantro and vodka  why would i say yes? it s because i like the game  ''and, i didn t say yes, and even though the  1 billion in stock options never came around, i think i d be even more proud of it if they had because money is a story  once you have enough for beans and rice, and taking care of your family, and a few other things, money is a story, and you can tell yourself any story you want about money, and it s better to tell yourself a story about money that you can happily live with  could you elaborate on that a little bit? what is your story about money? is it what you just said? this is a really important point, and it s something i ve been trying to mull over in the last year in particular ''seth godin  well, let me start with the marketing story about money, which is this  take a  10 00 bill and go to the bus station, walk up to someone, and say,  i ll sell you this  10 00 bill for  1 00   you should actually do this  no one will buy it from you ''there are a few reasons for this  the first reason is no one goes to the bus station hoping to make a financial transaction  the second one is only an insane person would try to sell you a real  10 00 bill for  1 00, and dealing with insane people is tricky  so, it must not be a real  10 00 and you should just walk away ''now, let s try a different thing  put a  10 00 bill in your neighbor s mailbox when he s not home and run away  do it the next day and the third day  on the fourth day, ring your neighbor s doorbell and say,  i m the guy who left three  10 00 bills in your mailbox  here s another one  do you want to buy it for  1 00?  you ll sell it because your neighbor knows you re crazy, but you re crazy in a very particular way, and you ve earned the trust that it s a real  10 00 bill  so, we assume that  10 00 bills are worth  10 00, but it s a mutual belief, and if the belief isn t present, they re worth nothing ''now, we get to our internal narrative about money  is money that number   it s not even pieces of paper anymore, it s a number on a screen   is that a reflection of your worth as a human? one of the things that derek said on your podcast   that i sort of disagree with   is that being rich is a signal   a symbol   that you ve created a lot of value for a lot of people ''i think lots of times, that s actually not true, and there are lots of ways to create value for people, and most of them do not involve money  so, what we have to decide   once we re okay, once we re not living on  3 00 a day, once we have a roof, once we have healthcare   how much more money we get and what we re going to trade for it  we always trade something for it unless we re fortunate enough that the very thing we want to do is the thing that also gives us our maximum income ''i don t think that merely because some blog decides that people with big valuations are doing better means you should listen to them  so, when you think of the word   if you even think of this word   when you hear the word  successful,  who s the first person that comes to mind for you and why?''seth godin  my parents were successful because of how many people they mattered to  my friend jacqueline novogratz, who i think should win the nobel prize, who runs the acumen fund, is insanely successful  she s changing whole continents of the earth by bringing an idea to the fore and doing it relentlessly year after year  and then, i think about people in my neighborhood who are successful because they get to shovel their neighbor s walk who s elderly and it snowed last night  that privilege and that trust lets them live a successful life  is there anything you ve changed your mind about in the last few years?''seth godin  other than the web being dumb?''tim ferriss  other than the web being dumb ''seth godin  yeah, there are a bunch of things  i ve changed my mind in each direction about the book industry   about it not mattering, then about it mattering, then about it being in a sad but slow decline  i ve changed my mind about the big companies in the center of our internet  i think that they changed around the same time i changed my mind   maybe before that ''they went from being really profoundly useful, important public goods that created enormous value to being public companies where there s so much pressure on management by everyone who works there to make the stock price go up that they don t often make decisions for the public good anymore, and i was probably na ve to think that they would keep doing it, but they are stopping  what is something that you believe that other people think is crazy or insane? this is a bastardization of a peter thiel question that i use in interviews sometimes ''seth godin  i think that deep down, i am certain that people are plastic   in the positive sense   flexible, and able to grow  i think almost everything is made, not born, and that makes people uncomfortable because it puts them on the hook, but i truly believe it  well, there you have it, folks  the collected wisdom   just a small sampling   from some of the smartest investing minds i ve ever bumped into ''now, i want to hear from you  please let me know   what did you like about this episode? what do you want to hear more of? what did you not like? what topics or themes would you be most likely to explore? please let me know  i love your feedback  just ping me on twitter  or you can leave a comment at tim blog podcast, and until next time   and as always   thank you guys so much for listening '"

 chris sacca   that s totally regional  i m from near buffalo, new york, so it s sacca  it s very nasally  you ve gotta get it right in the nose  sacca  i m chris sacca  hey you guys,  youse guys    tim ferriss   so, do you introduce yourself as sacca, or    chris sacca   let s see, what s your name? see, i m more focused on spelling it, because everyone like, what the hell? so i guess, a, c, c, a  so, i guess it s sacca, chris sacca  sacca comes off like, yeah, sacca   tim ferriss   alright, cool  and, you grew up, like you said, on the east coast, but let s do a quick, not entire retrospective, but to give people the present tense  what are you best known for?  chris sacca   professionally, or personally?  tim ferriss   both, aside from that amazing beard   chris sacca   or with my wife?  tim ferriss   all three   chris sacca   so, professionally, i m known for being a venture capitalist, an angel investor turned venture capitalist, and i was one of the first investors in twitter, one of the first investors in uber, instagram, kickstarter, docker, optimizely, lookout, twillio  just going down my unicorns   tim ferriss   so, you have this sort of unicorn radar, and the, you of course, had the angel investing experience, and then you had your fund experience  can you tell people a little bit about how that has gone for you?  chris sacca   in terms of managing my funds?  tim ferriss   just, your first fund   i would assume that is why you were recently on the cover of forbes magazine  in a horrifyingly gaudy t shirt   chris sacca   we can talk about the shirt  no, so our first fund is turning out to   it looks like it might be the  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    most successful fund in the history of venture capital  we had twitter in there, we had uber in there, instagram is in there  docker s still in there, optimizely s still in there  we had some very cool stuff, like zancoder was in there  so, we had some good deals, that have gotten bought along the way  but, it s taken off, like no fund has ever done, and right now, it s   i don t think uber s done growing, and so   tim ferriss   i certainly hope not   chris sacca   yeah  so, we re at somewhere around 250x multiple on the funds   tim ferriss   that s amazing  and, i want to   i ll start off, some people have followed our friendship over the years  the heckling on, the endless heckling on twitter  and    chris sacca   no, i m very sincere when i ask when you and kevin rose are gonna release the podcast when you guys make out  and, kevin told me that was behind the paywall, it s the bonus wrestling footage   tim ferriss   it s behind the paywall, and i think we have to slump in our careers, and then    chris sacca   keep that in your back pocket   tim ferriss   we ll pull a kardashian, reinvent ourselves  but, the gratitude i wanna express, before we get into things, is multifold  so, some people who have read the 4 hour body might recall that i mentioned you in that book, for introducing me to total immersion, which was, i think, the first time we ever met, that you brought that up  was it at the barbecue that k rose actually threw, outside his apartment  and, you said something along the lines of, when i described how bad i was at swimming, and pretty much incapable of swimming, you said,  i have the answer to your prayers   which i thought was a great response, which ended up being accurate, in this case, and it was total immersion swimming  so, i learned to swim for the first time, properly, in my 30 s, using that method  so, thank you for that  and, also, since the early days, have been a very open book when it came to talking to you about investing and advising  and, of course, the legal notepad has been now transcribed into  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    chris sacca   evernote  so, i have many sacca files, that are all very favorable  but, how did you   what were some of your formative experiences, growing up? well, i was, let me just talk to, in terms of what you were just saying about being generous with the   i mean, first of all, the total immersion thing is like a religion, when you get it, you get it   tim ferriss   right   chris sacca   and, i went from dragging my ass around the pool, just kicking too hard and paddling too hard, to, when total immersion hit me, i could suddenly swim a couple of miles, and get bored  and so, i was just there as an apostle, man, when you were like,  i m struggling with swimming   i was just geeking out  in the same way you can get going on lifting techniques, and stuff like that, i m like, you re in my world now, i m gonna talk about swimming  but, the same with the investing stuff  i mean, i was really lucky  when it came time for me to get started as an investor, i had many, many guys there, paying it forward, and teaching me about the game  guys like josh koppelman at first round, tony conrad at trueventures, really being generous with their time, and helping me figure out what was going on  the guys at industry ventures were indispensable for me, hans willdens and his team  so, and so, for me, when you came along and started asking questions about that, not only did i feel like i was paying it forward again  but, in the same way you and i never invest in a simple idea, the execution is everything, i don t feel like i m really giving any secret away by telling you what the approach is  you still have to go execute on it, right? so, i can give you my lens on how i think about this stuff  things other people have taught me, things i think i might have improved upon, etc  but, i can lay that playbook on you, and if you re not good at this, you can t fake it   tim ferriss   right   chris sacca   and, so, i don t really have any fear in kind of disclosing my secrets to b teamers, because they re not gonna end up competing with me  in your case, you re good at it  and so, it s become an incredible side business for you, in addition to everything you do with media  but, i, but there s no fear in putting that stuff out there  and, the  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    other lesson they taught me, is that if i get to you, and teach you some of this stuff, you re gonna naturally be an ally of mine in this industry  so, if i can get in there, and kind of teach you about how do i think about the world, how can i be helpful to companies, and you start using that same method, then, we re gonna end up doing deals together  and, you and i have, and we ve made a fair amount of money doing that, so i didn t wanna leave that unanswered  tim ferriss   it s really been fun to watch you sort of evolve, and grow and experiment in investing, also  and, you know, going back   we can rewind the clock to your upbringing a little bit later on  but, just since we re on the topic, what were some of the pieces of advice you were given, by say, the guys that you mentioned, or early on, that helped you to approach early stage investing in a more intelligent way?  chris sacca   yeah, i mean, a couple of guys have said things that i ve now taken in an amalgam, and have codified  so, i have rules for investing now that were definitely influenced by a lot of these guys giving me advice and things, that i ve now put to work  so, one is, only get involved in deals where i know i can personally impact the outcome  there s no guarantee that i can take it from x to sold, or x to ipo, but i need to know that i can have a material impact, to make something that s   to make something more likely to succeed  so, the second rule i ve developed, and this, again, developed by guys along the way who have given me advice, is start with something that s already great, that you can make more awesome  but, don t start with something that s something shitty, that you think you can make good  and, that s hard  like, when you work in a company   a lot of your listeners, i know, work in big companies, you have to work on the shit that somebody hands you  right? so, you re just dealt a really   you re dealt a 2 7, and you re like, well, that s what the boss gave me, i gotta play this hand out  when you get into investing, your default stance should be no  and, the temptation, always is, you see your first deal, and you re like, okay, i know i can be helpful to these guys  i know i can make this shitty thing better  and so, your first few deals are always the worst   tim ferriss   that s how i lost, yeah, 50 grand on my first deal, and i was just like, oh! it was like, 25 percent of what i had hypothetically  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    chris sacca   allocated, right? through two years  i was like, oh my god  it s because you get into that room, and you re like, okay, i know how i can make this thing better, right? and, you forget that you need to start with something that s already independently pretty damn good, and then make it better, so our third principle is, give yourself a chance to get rich  and, that was one that was more influenced by these fund investors, who were like, hey, it s all well and good to throw  25 k around into some of these deals, but most of them won t be homeruns  most of them won t turn into unicorns  most of those are going to require a ton of work, a bunch of them will fail, but a bunch of them will be successful to the tune of doubling that money, but over years and years of work  and so, i ve sold companies   i sold a company to amazon where i saw a 3x on a  50,000 investment, in a fund  by the time my fund got paid back, and i got my part back, and i was   had been busting my ass in that company for a couple years, i barely had money left to buy the guys dinner, to celebrate the deal  and so, so that s another thing, leaving ourselves enough room to benefit from scale  going in at prices that are low enough that, if the company s as successful as we think it s gonna be, we ve given ourselves a chance to get rich  and then, the fourth thing, that i think we evolved internally, or that i evolved, which is be proud of every deal  there s stuff that i ve passed on, that i just don t regret it at all  it just seemed like maybe a good way to make money, but i don t wanna have to explain to my kids that s how i made money  and, so, those are kind of the guiding principles i think have been shaped, but    tim ferriss   categorically, what would some of those be?  chris sacca   mistyped domains   tim ferriss   right   chris sacca   that s a great way to make money  people are stupid, and they mistype things all the time, and you can put ads on sites that don t really look like ads  subscription businesses that make it impossible for you to cancel your subscription   tim ferriss   right, the forced fulfillment, or forced continuity   chris sacca   you can sign up online, but you need to send them a postcard to cancel, stuff like that  i see that stuff, right? people making  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    unsubstantiated claims about the effectiveness of their stuff  you know, this anonymous content stuff, that was just going to bad places  so, i just wanna be really proud of our deals  and so, those, i think, are some principles that have been shaped by a lot of these guys that have given me advice along the way  tim ferriss   what are, when you meet with founders for the first time, what are   is there anything that disqualifies them quickly? are there certain sort of red flags that you look for?  chris sacca   yeah  so, this has evolved over time, you know? i ve now been doing this for a while, and have done over 100 deals  and have seen a bunch of those work out, and have seen them not work out, and i read all the posts that all my peers in the industry write, other vcs, you know, everyone s constantly stabbing at hey, what is the rule? how do you get into one of these meetings? so, let me first, i have a couple of parameters  one is, i almost always only invest in things that are already live, in production  just, no hypotheticals, no ideas  i think there might be one exception to that, and it was a particularly gifted entrepreneur that i already worked with before  but, other than that, we look for stuff that is already actually being   that has users, that can demonstrate that the team is capable of building and launching stuff together, and then getting it out there in the market  that said, the one thing that will turn me off right now   is if i see that in the pitch, the founder is trying to convince themselves  if i can pick up on any hint that they don t, like, in their marrow, believe in this story, then it s no dice  as i look at all the most successful founders i ve backed, the thing they have is inevitability of success  there are no conditional statements coming out of their mouths  there s no, like, well, if it works, it would be rad  it s just always   now, you talk to kevin systrom of instagram, when he was working on it himself  he was literally a sole guy, working on the product  and, he s like, so, when we get to 50 million users, we ll roll out this other stuff  and, you re just like, wait, what? he s just peering into the future, kinda looking through you into something in the future  and, you re just like, i gotta get along for the ride with this guy  the same thing when you talk to evan williams  when it comes to talking about the likelihood of success of his products, he just knows  like, he just knew twitter would be a big  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    thing  he knows medium will be a big thing  he doesn t need to convince you of that right now, he just knows  you talk to patrick and john collison at stripe  and, of course, they re building for this thing to be a big, dominant company, and it just will be  you ve spent time with travis, you re an investor in uber  was there any doubt at any time, that uber would dominate the planet? tim ferriss   yeah, no doubt   chris sacca   there s no doubt   tim ferriss   can you just share   there  an anecdote  we ve probably talked about it over drinks at some point, but the wii tennis   chris sacca   the wii tennis, playing travis at wii tennis?  tim ferriss   yeah, could you tell the story, please?  chris sacca   a couple years ago, we were up at my house  we live up in the mountains, in truckee, and it was over the holidays, so my parents were there  i think it was new year s day, and so travis and i had been   we have a tradition up there, on new year s eve  we go snowshoeing at midnight, and drink champagne out in the meadow and stuff  so, i think we were pretty   it was a pretty rough morning  but, travis is sitting on the couch, and my dad senses some weakness, and he challenges him to a game of wii tennis  so, on nintendo wii  my dad s not a bad player, he s pretty good  so, they   travis is like, okay, mr  sacca, sure  and he picks up the controller, and they re tight games, but travis wins them, and my dad is there, taking full swings with the paddle, you know, and travis is still blurry from the night before, barely breaking his wrists, and he s still beating my dad  he s like, what the hell is this? and then, there was that inigo montoya moment, princess bride style, where he s like, travis turns to my dad, and he says, i m sorry, but i m not left handed  and, i forget if he was left or right, but he switches hands with the controller, and the next three games, my dad never touches the ball  there are no points scored on any of travis  serves  my dad s like, what the hell is going on? what is this? and, finally, the torture got to be too much for him, travis said, i m sorry, let me take you to the global leader board, you know, mr  sacca, i didn t mean to be holding out on you  he goes to the global leader board, and travis kalanick was ranked no  2 in the world at wii tennis   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   in his spare time   chris sacca   now, uber was already a thing, then  literally, he was already building a startup, but he s just so obsessive, so competitive  and, that s the thing  as we look across the portfolios at all the most kickass companies, it s something they just have right up front, is they re not hoping and praying for success, they know it s going to happen   tim ferriss   on that note, though, so, to pull out two names, you have an evan williams   blogger, twitter, bdm, etc , then you have travis  personality wise, at least from the outside looking in, very different personality types  and, i bump into some investors who say, well, i only invest in merciless sort of highly offensive   offensive meaning not defensive, ceos  then, other people are like, no, i only invest in people who i would let watch my kids, or whatever it might be  but, what are the commonalities, or are there commonalities, when you look across these founders, for whom success and massive scale just seems predestined? what are the commonalities?  chris sacca   well, i think something   so, we ll take ev and travis as examples, but across our more successful founders, let s use a matt mullen, like at wordpress, that s a billion dollar company now, billion plus  these guys are all incredible, incredible listeners  so, when they do open their mouths, it can be bombastic and offensive, and aggressive, and in your face, but they re all incredible listeners, and i don t just mean in casual conversation  they really   if you catch ev, he s got a notebook always  and, if you ask to see the first, you know, last few pages of the notebook, he s just meeting with other people, billionaires and leaders, whose jobs might not overlap with his at all, but from whom he s learning  voracious reader  part of why medium started was, he was just back deep into long form content, when he took a break from twitter  this guy is just constantly learning, studying, studying  and so, when he speaks, it matters  but, he s listening more than he speaks  you know that about mullen, one of the most thoughtful people i ve ever seen   tim ferriss   yeah   chris sacca   i ve never seen anyone read as many books as that guy does, and retain all the knowledge   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   yeah, he s prolific, and also, it s i mean, he listens to anyone that he s sitting down with   chris sacca   uh huh   tim ferriss   doesn t matter if it s the waitress, or a primary school teacher  we ve done a lot of traveling together, he was on the podcast also, very good listener   chris sacca   yeah, and so, and you just look across the board, these guys are learning, they re modeling  they re constantly researching, they re gathering data  travis would think it a competitive disadvantage for you to know what s going on in his head, sometimes  so, he ll listen  and, it s an amazing talent, i think is a commonality across those people   tim ferriss   with the investing game, that you ve obviously been a participant in for quite a while now, you have to say no a lot  and, i was   took a close look at poker, with the tv show, and there were a couple of quotes that came up quite a bit  along the lines of, you know, i made my money sitting, not playing hands   chris sacca   uh huh   tim ferriss   but, that being said, what are some of the deals, the whales that got away?  chris sacca   yeah, so first of all, i mean, this is a rigged game, right, and i m just looking to make it even more rigged  so, for those who don t know, venture capital, it s totally unfair  people give me their money, i draw a management fee off of it, so they pay me   to take their money, and invest it for them  if i make money, then i pay them back the management fee, and then, after that, we split the profits, and i get a really big chunk of the profits  and, if i lose money, that s fine  it doesn t come out of my pocket  i keep my fee, and my investors lose money  that s how this industry works  that s bananas, right? and, eventually, it s gonna break  because it s    tim ferriss   you ve also incepted me with the term bananas, which i ve started using compulsively  mazio has started doing the same thing  he works with chris   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    chris sacca   yeah, it s just an unforgivably unfair, rigged game, that s in favor of the venture capitalists  so, the reality is, the risk of an investor doesn t begin to compare to the risk of a founder  and so, that s something, sometimes that drives me crazy about investors  and, i love the entrepreneurial spirit that goes into building a firm  i mean, i built my firm from scratch  and, there s certainly founder type lessons in there, but you re cash positive from day one when you start a venture fund, and your downside is incredibly limited by the structure of the fund  so, that said, what it allows me to do is place some bets on some stuff that, i d like to think success is inevitable, but with those things, but i can take   i can look at the risk analysis, and say, okay, is the binary outcome a one or a zero? and, some of those things just don t get there  you know, one of my constant, recurring nightmares is about the stuff i passed on   tim ferriss   yeah, that s it exactly  that s what i was trying to ask   chris sacca   you know, i ve done some deals i thought were gonna be a lot bigger, and it ends up going away  but, the dropbox guys, i ended up   i met those guys very early on, when it was still in like, combinator  i got an early look, i pulled those guys aside, and i was like, hey, look, at google, we re using a version of this called platypus  which became g drive, and they re gonna crush you guys, so you should probably find some other product to pip it to  that probably cost me hundreds of millions of dollars  the    tim ferriss   did they give you a pat on the head and walk away?  chris sacca   yeah, no, it s   when i see drew, the ceo of dropbox, i bring it up before he can  that s just    tim ferriss   good self defense, there   chris sacca   yeah, i get it out there right away  the airbnb guys, at ycommerce  same thing   tim ferriss   incredible business   chris sacca   an amazing business, and one to be proud of, too  i m really jealous that i m not in that business, and not just for the money  i love what they do  i really admire them, and what they do, a lot, and their culture  but, at the time, they were allowing you to rent  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    out a room in somebody else s house, while the owner was still there  and that just seemed really scary to me, and i pulled the guys aside, and i was like, guys, somebody s gonna get raped or murdered in one of these houses, and the blood is gonna be on your hands  i literally said that out loud to them  and, what s that worth  15 or 20 billion now? tim ferriss   in fairness, you re probably not wrong  something has to happen   chris sacca   it has to happen  at a certain scale, yeah, yeah  i mean, i like to say sometimes, when you think about scale, like, someone who works at wal mart murdered someone last night   tim ferriss   yeah   chris sacca   there s just no doubt about it  at that scale, with a few million employees, one of them murdered someone last night   tim ferriss   you have to look at it like edward norton in fight club, like, an actuarial analysis   chris sacca   yeah   tim ferriss   for insurance, which is terrifying, but that s the reality of big numbers   chris sacca   so, there s one other famous one, but, actually, i ll give you two  nick, because i wasn t reminded of this until recently  nick woodman, from gopro came to google  now, i wasn t an investor at the time, but i did a lot of google s investments and partnerships  so, eric schmidt, ceo of google said, hey, will you come in here and sit with this pitch? he s a friend of a friend, we ve gotta meet this guy  and, nick comes in with gopro, and eric s like, i don t know  and, i m like, we d be foolish to do this deal  how s this guy from santa cruz gonna compete with all these asians in building hardware? you know, you can t hold a candle to the taiwanese and the koreans, it s like, no dice, man  let this guy go, and i think i introduced him to somebody over at youtube, just as a consolation  i saw that dude this winter, skiing  he s worth, like  3 or 4 billion now, and he didn t forget that meeting, so  and then, the snapchat guys, i gave a talk in la, and they came up to me, they came up to me after the talk, i d never met them  and said, we re big fans, we d like to work with you  and i was like, enh, sure  i mean, i know you guys are up to  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    something cool, i admire it  and, i took eight weeks to set up that meeting, and by then, the benchmark guys had done that deal  and that s, again, oh my god, i can t imagine how much money we left on the table as a result of that  so, i like to say, when i m wrong, i m wrong, and when i m right, i m really, really right  so  tim ferriss   the question on being wrong though, i m really curious about this  just coming back to the poker analysis  or, analogy, rather  the   and i first heard about this in depth when i became friends with some hedge fund managers, and they really try to focus on good process, and not conflating say, bad outcomes with bad process  in other words, did i make the right decision at the time, even though i missed out on a huge opportunity  because, you can also say, pick a company for the wrong reasons, and have a fantastic outcome  but, over time, if you develop bad habits, it can really screw you, right? so, do you think that you made the wrong decision with those companies, in terms of the process that you followed? or, did you make the right decision, based on your rules you set up for yourself, and you missed out on a few opportunities, but also hit some home runs?  chris sacca   the one thing that all those failures to invest, that they all have in common, is that i let the negative case dominate my choice of whether i should invest or not  so, in the beginning, as a seed stage investor, you don t really get a lot of data, right?  tim ferriss   right   chris sacca   we don t really get a lot of   have any financials to look at, the team usually consists of three to five people  there are some users, but not enough at scale, they re usually just the early adopters  so, you don t know if it s gonna be a big thing yet  so, you don t really have a massive diligence process, so a lot of what you re going on is your gut about this product, and about this team  and, i think the easiest way to screw this up is to let the negative case dominate your perspective  so, dropbox  i m thinking about the competitive landscape, and i m thinking, okay, google s gonna crush them  well, first of all, we ve seen that didn t actually happen, and rarely does the incumbent crush anybody   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    it s just not that common  a startup is going to move much faster than a division of a company where it s not their bread and butter  i mean, g drive spent three years in beta, you know? internal beta, all that  it was never really a priority for them, so of course dropbox is gonna win that  i look at airbnb  yes, there s gonna be bad things that happen, like, people get their apartments trashed from time to time  but, somehow, i let that distract me from the potential for this worldwide marketplace for space, that was just gonna displace hotels  with snapchat, i m thinking about dick pics, and how it s being used by   tim ferriss   that was on the pro side   chris sacca   yeah, exactly  like, yay! but, i m thinking, like, it s lame content, it s being used poorly by like, junior high girls, who are exposing themselves, and stuff like that, and it was just bad examples of how snapchat wasn t necessarily a helpful thing, and again, i like to be proud of my deals  on the other hand, you see today, it s just, it s a network with hundreds of millions of users, who are building incredibly valuable content, with the launch of stories and discover, and stuff like that  but, i got distracted  i let the downside and negative case outweigh the risk  and yet, you look at uber  uber could ve   it was easy enough to say no to uber, because like, aww, the taxis, or the regulation, or the lobby, or these drivers are gonna hurt people at some point  and somehow, i was able to look past all that, when nobody else in the valley wanted to, and get that deal done   tim ferriss   yeah  what s   what i think is really interesting about uber in particular   and for those who don t know, i was an early advisor to uber, so i m biased, obviously, in a lot of ways when i talk about it  but    chris sacca   i think you actually got there before me   tim ferriss   yeah, i was pre seed money advisor, because i had actually been an advisor at stumbleupon, i had worked with garrett, and am now working, again, collaborating with him on expo, which is super fun  but, in the beginning, the way that uber got dismissed, and i think this is a really common mistake it seems that a lot of investors make, is people said, oh, my god, really? black cars in san francisco for 1 percenters, what s the market for that?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and, they viewed a very niche activity as, by definition, constrained to, say, 1 percenters in san francisco and new york  and, if you look at, let s say recycling, it started out that way  and, they kind of confused the first target with the whole market  and, they also looked at just the available market, which they misdefined very early on, and didn t   you know, in the case of an airbnb, or an uber, they can grow the market beyond any comparable that s available  so, i guess   but, a lot of these start off so incredibly niche that a lot of people misread the market potential, i think  but, let me ask you a question about the, getting   focusing on the positive scenarios, and the potential high multiple outcomes  because, for those people who aren t familiar with venture capital, it s a term that comes up a lot in magazines and media coverage, it s very hot right now  so, you explained it in brief, but it s the   fair to say that 2 and 20 is a fair way to think about it, in terms of the   i mean, not everybody  but, that s how people talk about venture capital, and hedge funds and so on, you have this management fee, and then you have the carry, which is kind of your split  but, what i wonder is, do you think vcs should not think about the downside as much as the upside, because they re only   they re rewarded on the upside, and not on the downside, whereas hedge fund investors can have long short bets, and thing more about   when i hang out with hedge fund guys, as opposed to venture capitalists, or vcs, the hedge fund guys are much more apocalyptic in their thinking, and it would seem like a lot of that thinking is tied to their ability to make money from a lot of those catastrophes  chris sacca   yeah, i mean, those guys can be short  in fact, even if the apocalypse isn t approaching, they ll still get people to write articles about the impending apocalypse for those companies, to make sure that it s a self fulfilling prophecy   tim ferriss   yeah  so, what are the biggest differences in your mind, between say the top venture capitalists, hedge fund guys, and private equity guys? or, yeah, how do they differ, if they do, or what do they have in common?  chris sacca   well, as we were talking about at lunch, first of all, everyone i know on wall street is just jacked on stimulants, all day long  so,  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    they re taking provigil, they re doing rails   those guys are just in such an incredibly competitive environment that they re using every chemical edge they can find  that s definitely not happening in the vc set  the vc life demands kind of a much more steady, reflective state  there s certainly, obviously, moments of negotiation and standoffs, but it s much more of a thought, and emotional intelligence exercise  that said, because the valley, silicon valley is so kind of built on positive energy, and loveydovey   what ends up happening is, as the stakes have gotten higher, the funds have gotten bigger, it s more competitive than ever, it s more flushed with capital, and a friend of mine who i ve done some work with, who s on the east coast in the private equity world, he says the main difference between new york and san francisco is, out here in new york, we stab each other in the eye, face to face  and, out there, you guys just cut the other guys  achilles, and let them bleed out while looking at them  it s just, it s incredible  i think in the san francisco world, we really try and maintain these long term friendships, and try and build these reputations that will scale over time  because as a venture capitalist, you re raising money on a   every three years, basically, and it s a ten year fund, and you re hoping to have a long tenure in the industry, with great relationships that you can draw on to recruit people to your portfolio companies, that you can use to help your portfolio companies raise more money, go public, get sold  and, because we re big equity holders, who only get paid back upon an ultimate exit maybe ten years from now, we tend to act more with that in mind  that long term perspective  guys i work with on the east coast have much shorter timeframes  they re much more used to quarter by quarter analysis of a public company  hey, do you have any news today? they   it s very, very near term, and they don t have the stomach for the ups and downs of building this stuff over time  and so, it s great  they re living by a different report card than we are  tim ferriss   yeah   chris sacca   so, that s the biggest thing  we   there are other businesses like this  like, the media business is a cash quarterly business  you go to a media company, you go to a record label or a movie studio, and you say, let s do an equity deal, and they laugh in your face   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    like, how much revenue are you gonna guarantee in year one? because that s how they get paid, right? all those executives are on annual contracts, and they ve got payments that they still owe on their houses in the hamptons, and they re just like   i m not gonna walk away from that guaranteed cash right now  sorry, i m breaking because you re laughing right there  i know this is taking   tim ferriss   no, no, no, this is good  now, i wonder if that could also be related to the fact that, say in silicon valley, it s such a small world, and you work very hard to get to a point where you have deal flow, meaning opportunities that come to you, that are of a sort of prefiltered high quality  right? whereas, in a lot of these other spaces, they re going out and using analysts to sort of hunt for opportunities that other people have not exploited  so, it s human beings responding to incentives, right? in a way   chris sacca   well, in a hedge fund environment, you re working with public stocks, usually at arm s length  you might try and go activist, and get on the board, you might try to, like i alluded to, change the press cycle   tim ferriss   yep   chris sacca   but, for the most part, you re doing arm s length analysis of these companies  in the private equity world, there s a business already there   tim ferriss   right   chris sacca   there are products, or multiple products, there s financials, there s supply chain  and so, you re going in, and saying, i can do a better job of this than you can  and so, there s an arm s length, and there s some tension, obviously, with management, usually  sometimes, you re co opting members of that management team to go get it done  but, the venture world is different, in that it s much earlier, and it s much more aware of the venture capitalist as a collaborator in determining the product and the strategy, and the vector the business is gonna take  and so, there has to be a much more collaborative approach, over the long term, to actually go ahead and build this company  so, there s nothing   and, i think there are certainly venture capitalists who have come out of the world of finance, or have a different  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    perspective, that their job is just to sit on the outside, and tell somebody how to run a business  that s the private equity model  but, as a real, early stage venture capitalist, your job is to actually sit in the room, and actually work at the beck and call of the ceo, to get stuff done, to help build this company  lend advice about product strategy, about going to market, about the design of the front page, how to staff up, and bring in the next couple members of the team, how to go about raising money, how to deal with your first pr cycles  and so, that, i think, brings a much different person in the successful niche  not necessarily the biggest self promoter, not necessarily the most widely known person, etc  but, somebody who actually can hustle, to go ahead, and as we go back to what we talked about earlier, to tip the balance from something that s good to being totally awesome  tim ferriss   right  what books or resources, outside of these mentors, and the personal relationships that you ve had, the compliments, and so on  are there any particular books or resources that have helped you become a better investor?  chris sacca   yeah, i think most of those, though, are not business books, per se   tim ferriss   that s good, that s great   chris sacca   because, so i didn t get a business degree, i didn t do an mba  i took a couple classes, it was enough to show me it was a total farce  i did get a law degree, which is an even bigger farce, but that s for another episode  so, i never had formal business training, so i don t really   and, i tried to look at a few of those instant mba books, and stuff like that, i even bought some books on venture capital, and they re just such a   so goofy  and, by the way, part of that is because we now have so many great venture capitalist bloggers, who are just an open book about the industry, who teach it  so, brad feld comes to mind first   tim ferriss   fantastic   chris sacca   a longtime friend and mentor, brad at feldthoughts, has done series over the years, where he breaks down each aspect of a term sheet, and how to understand it, and then deal documents, and this is what we think is important, these are things we think could go  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    away  josh koppleman, his team has done a lot of work  we ve now seen y combinator, and the guys at fenwick and west and cooley, building templated documents that are really really watered down, and pro entrepreneur   and, just kind of have taken out a lot of the legacy bullshit that didn t need to be in those documents  and so, there s a lot of this learning that can happen now, without having to buy books, and without having to go to school, so that s been fantastic  but, where i worry about the valley, and about investors, as well as our entrepreneurs, is in the development of everything a little off the ball, a little bit  so, you and i   i just turned 40 this week, that s why you re here  tim ferriss   happy birthday, again   chris sacca   but, as a 40 year old, the people my age who were computer science majors in college, they, that was a major just like any other major  they still had to go get a summer job, they mowed lawns, waited tables, they had time in their curriculum to go study abroad, to volunteer  they had these really well rounded lives  and so, working with people my age and older at google, who are computer scientists was great  not just because they had these amazing math and science skills, but a diversity of experience that informed great product decisions, as well as just collegiality  what ended up happening was, computer science degrees got so popular, and so valuable, that those kids didn t have to pay for school much anymore, and their only work experience was taing a class  not actually getting their ass kicked digging ditches or anything  and, the curriculum was rigorous enough that these guys didn t get to go study abroad  and, there was no opportunity to go do volunteer work, and live in the developing world at all  so, as a result, i found that we were starting to have a generation of not just entitled   you know, people talk about the entitlement of millennials when it comes to work ethic and stuff, but, they weren t just entitled, but they just had such narrow band perspectives on the world  they were missing empathy, so they weren t able to put themselves in the shoes of people who they might be building a product for, what the problems of a world might be, and so, i am constantly looking for opportunities for myself, and for the founders we work with, to broaden the scope that they have on the world, such that they can build something on a more  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    informed bases, and emotionally informed basis  so, i really think empathy isn t   it s a word that s been sort of reduced to a signal  like, oh, somebody hurt their foot, and i feel bad for them  instead, i think much more poignantly, empathy is about, can i see the world through that person s lens? can i figure out what matters to them? what are they afraid of, what s bothering them? what do they think is limiting them right now? what s their hope? and, if i can do that, then it s a lot easier for me to build something for them, and to sell it to them, and to help them, and to build a longer term partnership with that person  tim ferriss   if you were giving an assignment to folks, for books or experiences, just a short list for people who want to develop that type of empathy, what would you put on the list?  chris sacca   one of my favorite books, that we give to most founders, is not fade away  i think it s    tim ferriss   bellyflop pic on the cover   chris sacca   yeah, bellyflop pic  a short life well lived  it s by peter barton  that   so, first of all, on a personal note, that guy s trajectory kind of followed mine  he was a ski bum, who suddenly made it big in tech  he was on the board at yahoo, he worked at liberty media, and then he hits his 40s, and says, okay, i ve accomplished what i want to accomplish, i m dialing it back, i just wanna spend time with my family  and, at that point   and, this isn t a spoiler, it s literally how the book starts  he finds out he has incurable stomach cancer  and so, the book walks you through his biography, as well as the remaining time in his life  you will cry reading this book, it is inevitable  if you don t, i m very worried about you  but, you ll definitely cry, it ll be cathartic  but, it s the kind of thing where you   it s an exercise in, okay, what s on the mind of the person who s dying, and how is he thinking about the impact of his death on his family, on his friends, on his business partners, on his legacy, on the continuing responsibilities as a dad, even in the absence of   even though he s passed on to the next life, and it s an entire exercise in perspectives, and i think that book will not only leave you feeling incredibly lucky for what we ve got here, where we are, but at the same time, will sharpen that sense of, how do i put myself in somebody else s shoes?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    a similar book that i love, it s   i m gonna get the title wrong  i think it s how to get filthy rich in rising asia? tim ferriss   i remember you told me about that  i haven t read it yet   chris sacca   this book is amazing  so, it s written in the second person, which, i don t know of another book like that  but, it s just you, you, you  you wake up in this room, almost like an old role player or something like that, online   tim ferriss   right, like dungeons and dragons   chris sacca   yeah  wolfenstein  you are in a room, there is a sarcophagus  open sarcophagus? no, it s, but it says, you wake up, and you basically start the book in a slum in pakistan  and, it s just writing to you about how you go through your day, the things that matter to you  and, it turns out you re kind of entrepreneurial, and you re willing to take some risks, and so, you start working into other stations in life  and, i don t wanna give anything else about the book away, but you close that book, and you feel like you ve walked through 15 to 20 different lives in another world  and, i just think more of that would be better for all of us  i think it d be better for our industry, for the depth and the impact of the products we build  i think it d just be a lot better for getting along with each other, so  i mean, you and i have traveled to ethiopia together, doing work for charity water  it s hard to complain about a day s work back here in the united states, when you have been in a village where they walk three to four hours each way to get water, where the kids are dying, because they drink the same water that the cow poops into  where the women don t get an opportunity to go to school, because they re carrying the water, and along the way, they might get eaten by a lion or raped, and it s really hard to find yourself complaining about our privileged us life, and that s something you can just tell  working at a big company like google, there were the people that would bitch and complain, and i m like, really? this is a hard day? microsoft launched a competitive product, and that s our horrible day? and, i just think we d all be much better off if we were able to find opportunities for our cs students to go study abroad, for our mbas to actually spend some time around poor people   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and, to start building these more diverse perspectives  tim ferriss   when you look back on   since it s the big 4 0, when you were 30, who came to mind most when you thought of the word successful, and now, at 40, who is the person who most comes to mind when you think of the word successful?  chris sacca   so, 30, that s a really   let me think of where i was  oh, i guess i was at google at the time  who was most successful?  tim ferriss   just when you were like, i wanna be successful, and the person in your mind who embodied that most   chris sacca   yeah  i always wanted to be at the center of the deal  and so, at that point in my life, i still really admired like, a john doer, or mike moritz  they were both on the board at google  brilliant guys, who used their station in life to gather even smarter people, to teach them about things  and then, they would use their unique talents for storytelling, and making kind of composite ideas come true, to build companies  they became billionaires as a result  they had great families, they were just well respected by folks i think i still   that was kind of my definition of success at that point  at 40, and what i think my journey from 30 to 40 was about, was to stop trying to define, or build some kinda model out there, or have some kinda role model, and stop trying to define myself externally, because that s a distraction  so, there were times when you were doing a deal with john doer, you re across the table with someone, and you re like, hey, wait, that was fucked up, you know? like, wait, you re supposed to be my hero, my idol, and i don t like that move you just made, or something like that  and, i think anyone i ve ever put on a pedestal, i ve just been disappointed by doing so,  tim ferriss   i m sorry about that, by the way   chris sacca   oh, you have no idea how far you ve fallen, tim  but, so, i think, for me, the exercise has been, how much am i gonna define that for myself, and not by looking and someone else? i recently got to have dinner next to bill gates, bill and melinda gates, and i had been raised to hate him  growing up at google, he s a pretty evil person  and, i was sitting next to him, there, and i got to basically interview him about how they have structured the foundation  how they think about which causes to take on, which challenges to  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tackle, and i mean, i walked out of there just deeply admiring their work  but, i think i wanna limit it to that, and not get into is he a great family man? he s still a son of a bitch, when it comes to competing with him in software, and his default browser, and all his anti trust behavior  but, i really   so, i m trying to look at people and find one aspect of them that i like  but, for the most part, i ve had to decide, okay, what s really important to me? that s my wife, and my kids, and you know i m just not that social anymore  i don t hang out with people that much, i don t go to conferences, i m not available for dinner  i would just infinitely rather spend that time with them  and so, that was a priority choice i had to make internally, not because i saw anybody else killing it that way  i think i reflected back on my own parents, who opted out of a much more accelerated career path, so they could spend more time with me and my brother  so, that s a choice i had to make  but, i will say, do you know about the journal i found in my garage? tim ferriss   i do, and you should mention that  i have a quick   well, observation is, if i could spend more time with crystal instead of me, i would do the same thing  we actually met before you and i met, at fairtex kickboxing  way back in the day   chris sacca   yeah, so, i was having a bunch of people down for cocktails  we came down from truckee into the city, crystal and i did, and we were like, let s get a bunch of people together for cocktails  and we invite tim, and tim comes in, and he looks at my girlfriend, he s like, i think i know you  i was like, yeah, sure you do, man  everyone uses that to try and pick up my girlfriend now wife  and he s like, no, i   and she s like, yeah, i think i know you too  like, oh shit, here she goes   tim ferriss   where s this going?  chris sacca   he s such a hunk, what do i have to offer? but, yeah, you guys used to train in kickboxing   tim ferriss   yeah, she was hardcore   chris sacca   still is   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   yeah, but i wanna pause for a second, but i do wanna hear about the notebook for sure, because i think it s amazingly nostradamus like  but, you and your brother  so, you and your brother have had very different careers, have done very well respectively  what did your parents do that you are also trying to do with your kids?  chris sacca   yeah, so, my brother, brian sacca, he s one of the first youtube sketch stars  he parlayed that into, he sold some of the first web series ever  made a shit ton of money, building web series, and finding commercial partners for them and stuff   tim ferriss   and movies, like wolf of wall street   chris sacca   he did wolf of wall street with scorsese recently  and then, just yesterday, we re allowed to talk about this now, his series on tbs got picked up, so he s gonna be the costar on a series on tbs, hopefully   tim ferriss   amazing   chris sacca   so, what did our parents do? well, first of all, they were just always involved, so, my parents took vacations with us  we always went to national parks together, we never went to resort type places, we were just always together  and, not only did they read with us, like most parents, but my mom would pull us out of school, to take us to go see an author read at a bookstore an hour and a half away  she would pull us out of school to go to a science museum or something  she was a college professor, she she had some flexibility in her schedule, to yank us out  she would take us to a park called art park, up in lewiston, new york   tim ferriss   art park?  chris sacca   art park, in lewiston, new york, in upstate new york  it s a state park, where everything is dedicated to different art media  so, you can paint there, you can blow glass  you can watch a performing arts troupe, kind of vaudevillian theater and stuff, and in my parents  eyes, that was just as, or maybe even more important than going to the public school, so, i think that kind of enrichment, and just being shown that all these people, in all these different walks of life were important and fascinating  i grew up where, by the time i got to college, i had never heard of an investment banker  i didn t know that was a job   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    i d been exposed to writers, to artists, to chefs, to musicians, to engineers, to lots of teachers, to lawyers to doctors  but it was never   it wasn t necessarily driven in any particular way, to kind of get us to a particular career at all  i will say there is something else my parents did and it was pretty unique, and it was called   my brother and i refer to it as the sweet and sour summer  so, my parents would send us, for the   tim ferriss   sounds like a chinese restaurant   chris sacca   yeah, they would send us, for the first half of the summer, to an internship with a relative or a friend of the family who had an interesting job  so, at 12, i went and interned with my god brother, who is a lobbyist in dc  so, i would go along with him, to pitch congressmen  i had one tie, and for work, i was a pretty good writer  so, i d write up one page summaries of these bills we were pitching, and i d literally sit there with these congressmen, with these filthy mouths, you know, the old alabaman senator, and stuff like that, and watch the pitch happen, and it was awesome  i learned so much, and developed so much confidence, and i think really honed my storytelling skills  but then, from there, i would come home, and work in just a construction outfit, in just a nasty, nasty job  i mean, whether it was hosing off the equipment that had been used to fix septic systems, gassing shit up, dragging shit around in the yard, filling up propane tanks  just being the junior guy on the totem pole, and quite literally getting my ass kicked by whichever parolee was angry at me that day  for minimum wage  i think it was part of their master plan, which is, there s a world of cool opportunities out there for you, but let s build within you a sense of not just work ethic, but also, a little kick in the ass about why you don t wanna end up in one of those real jobs  so, let s see if you can find within yourself the drive to do whatever it is to    tim ferriss   and, did they choose, for instance, you had the introduction to the god brother, i think you said, for the lobbying  did they also help organize the sour part too, to each summer?  chris sacca   yeah, so the guy who ran that construction company, and equipment rental company is my dad s best friend, and he was under strict orders to make sure we had the roughest day there   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   no special treatment   chris sacca   yeah, we were treated especially shittily  we were hammered there  so, and by the way, as a result, i know a lot about construction equipment  this is a superpower of mine  i can literally, from air compressors to ditch witches, to anything you need, milwaukee saws, awls   i literally have incredible amounts of knowledge in that space   tim ferriss   it also just reminded me of something you mentioned long ago, and i m not sure if it s still true, but you said one of the things you look for, and it s maybe not a disqualifier, but, in founders, is a track record of having had at least one shitty job   chris sacca   yeah, well, i particularly look for that in hiring, so, i want people who ve lived, studied, traveled extensively abroad  i want people who ve been exposed to poor people  and, by the way, the live, study, travel, work extensively abroad is because you can get away with a very comfortable life in the united states as an english speaker, particularly as a white person  you never really have to ask for anybody s help, you re not being harassed by the police, it s pretty easy pickings  you find yourself overseas, particularly with a non romance language where you can t make out the signs yourself, and you have to stop and ask for help from complete strangers  you literally have to be entirely vulnerable to people you ve never met, and just expose yourself  and, they could send you into a dark alley, and beat the hell out of you, and take your money  or, like most people on the planet, they ll be really nice, and try to help you  even if you don t share a word of english in common  and, i think there is something incredibly formative about that experience, of having   the humility that comes of having asked for help  the best managers in the world are people who are good at asking for help, and realizing that makes them a better ceo than a more powerful ceo, or a more powerful manager than a less powerful manager  so, i look for people for whom athletics is a big part of their life  i don t think it needs to be team sports, necessarily, i think you can be a great individual athlete  maybe you train with other folks, etc  but, i think it just shows not only some self discipline, but also a value on the introspection that comes from athletics  you actually  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    care about yourself, and i think there s a little more balance in that life  tim ferriss   i think it also teaches you to contend with losing, and how to view that as feedback, and not some type of failure death sentence   chris sacca   sure  and then  seeing how temporary pain is   tim ferriss   pain is temporary, glory is forever   chris sacca   it s true  i remember when i did an ironman, and when i was doing that, i had a fever that day, a 103 degree fever, but my parents had traveled out to watch the race, and so i didn t wanna not do it  and, the advil worked for the swim, and the first part of the bike, and then i was just a mess  but, i remember thinking, no matter what happens, i will be in my bed tonight, and this is a very, very temporary moment  in 2009, i rode my bike across the country  and, i remember, it was 35 days of riding, basically 100 miles a day  i remember multiple days out there, where i m like, i will be in my bed tonight, and then, in the other ear is this voice, and then i have to fucking do it again tomorrow   tim ferriss   i m gonna pull out a couple of random ones, but, what historical figure do you most identify with?  chris sacca   buckminster fuller   tim ferriss   why? and, maybe you could give some historical context, for people who don t recognize old bucky   chris sacca   bucky is   i mean, there   i feel like if we went to his wikipedia page, there d be a paragraph of nouns describing this guy  he was a mathematician, he was a philosopher, he was an engineer, he was a poet  he was a lecturer, teacher, he was an inventor  a futurist  he s one of the few people you will find who is willing to write the optimistic case for technology  that all this stuff isn t leading us to dystopia  that we actually are busting malthus and the malthusian quandary wide open  that we now have the resources to feed everyone, clothe everyone, power everything, without having to dig holes  i mean, the guy s   he passed away 30 years ago, now  but there is an optimism to everything he writes there, that these machines aren t here to take over, that humans are good at heart, and there s something really inspiring about that, as we wrestle with these big, scary issues, about the power of the internet to   you know, we   periscope gets  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    launched, and in the first week, i am getting questions from reporters about, well, can t isis use this to rally people? and, you re like, seriously? that s the part you re gonna focus on for periscope? all of the amazing uses for periscope, and i think it s absolutely groundbreaking technology, and really, really cool  and, people are still focused on that negative case, and at the same time, i think periscope can be used to inspire educate, heal  bring people together across so many different plains  that it s easy to get distracted by that negative case  but, i think that bucky, more than anyone, found optimism in the stuff that could otherwise be pretty daunting  tim ferriss   he also, didn t he also create   geodesic is not the word i m looking for   chris sacca   geodesic domes, yeah   tim ferriss   they are geodesic domes, that you see people constructing at burning man   chris sacca   yeah   tim ferriss   fascinating guy   chris sacca   and the bucky ball   tim ferriss   and the bucky ball  really interesting dude  also, what s that concept?  chris sacca   dymaxion   tim ferriss   oh, there were more  there s some type of    chris sacca   tensegrity   tim ferriss   tensegrity, which   good man  so, this concept of tensegrity, i m not gonna do it justice, but there are some really interesting parallels between his discussion of this concept of tensegrity and the role of fascia within the body  because if you didn t have fascia, your organs would just basically drop down to the bottom of your torso cavity, and just sit there in a pool of nasty meat  but, you have this fascia that holds you together   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    chris sacca   fascinating guy   tim ferriss   completely agree  did you collect anything when you were younger? and then, we need to talk about your notebook   chris sacca   yeah  i collected money  i was just all    tim ferriss   you collected money?  chris sacca   i just always wanted to make money   tim ferriss   do the backstroke like uncle scrooge, swimming through the coins?  chris sacca   yeah  excuse me, i scratched my monocle swimming through my room of coins  i was a hustler from day one  we grew up middle class, so we never had want of anything, but i always thought there would be a certain independence that would come with money, a certain excitement that came with making money  so, from the earliest days, i would   you ever seen those walnuts, those pungent walnuts that come out of a tree, they ve got that green, pungent skin on them?  tim ferriss   yeah   chris sacca   and, if you pierce them with a fork, it smells like ammonia  so, i would grab those things out of our front yard, pierce holes in all of them, then i would build a sign that says  air fresheners, 25 cents  and i would put it on my brother like a sandwich board  and my brother and i would just tow it up and down the street, and sell these things door to door, and all the people would call my parents, and be like, do you know where your son is? but they d still buy them  so, i d clear  3,  4, come home the richest six yearold in the neighborhood  i just loved that hustle, i was always chasing after something   tim ferriss   so, was that something you were just pre programmed to do, or did your parents facilitate that as well?  chris sacca   it s not my parents  game at all  i mean, my mom is a really accomplished professor and author in the field of education  my dad is an incredible small town lawyer, who frankly could ve made a lot more money, but was constantly doing pro bono work for people in our town  he s an incredibly revered person, with so much good will  and so, neither of them were hustlers, like that   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    but, i was always looking for the angles  tim ferriss   was there a movie? did you watch, like the toy or trading places, was there like, a treasure?  chris sacca   trading places is a good movie  no, i mean, i will say, i traded baseball cards, despite not liking baseball at all  i didn t watch any games, but that  86  87 don russ year, the  85 topps, with the canseco rookies, the roger clemens rookies, the mark mcguire olympic card from  84  i was really into those things, because i was good at it, and i could make money doing it  later, i realized i was really good at playing cards, too, so i played a lot of cards  i ran a cardroom in my high school  one of my teachers    tim ferriss   what type of card games we talking?  chris sacca   we played a lot of bouree, which is a game that s only played in new orleans, and lockport, new york, it s a really high stakes, geometrically growing pot game, and so you can really, you can get     crosstalk  tim ferriss   especially if you re teaching them the rules   chris sacca   a lot of that, a lot of hearts, a lot of bid pitch  a lot of acey deucy  and, we had a teacher who took a rake, i had him on the take, so he would write passes so people could get to the card room  but, i always kinda just had a hustle   tim ferriss   how old was that, how old were you?  chris sacca   i did that, i started that in junior high  one of our friends    tim ferriss   what did this teacher teach? what was his subject?  chris sacca   one of our friends, his mom was a teacher, and she had an office, so we got to use the office as the card room  it was more aceydeucy back then, it wasn t a really cerebral game  but, again, it had the progressive pot type stuff  in high school, it was my crosscountry coach, and american history teacher, mr  main  he was a gem  that guy, he just knew i wasn t cut out for public high school, so he really helped me   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   you ve also had   you ve always had this hustle  so, i have to ask, and feel free to parry this one if you want to  so, i ve heard these rumors that you went through law school without going to any classes   chris sacca   yeah, well, i   if you go to class, then they ve got your name on the seating chart  the first day of class, you ve gotta sign the seating chart that goes around, and then you sit in the same seat every day in law school  but, if you don t go to class, and your name s not on the seating chart, and so they can t call on you, and realize you re not going to class  and so, instead, you just go to the exams  and, the exams are just printed off the registrar s roll, right? and the teacher of the class isn t there  so, you just sit down for the exam, and if you re a good test taker, you can kill it  and, i was amazing  i had some of the best grades in my law school   tim ferriss   how did you orchestrate that? what was the method to the madness?  chris sacca   well, the funny thing is, unlike any other college class or mba class, what s taught in the classroom at law school, a) has nothing to do with being a lawyer, and b) has very little to even do with the exam  it s such a joke, man  the socratic method, and stuff like that  i think there are some people who need to be taught to think linearly, you know? pro con, pro con, pro con  but, i think by that point, i and my roommate, kevin cody, who you ve met, were already there  owen brainerd, of brainerd capital was the year ahead of us, at georgetown law school, and he helped us realize this method  he was like, the tim ferriss of georgetown law school, he helped us realize what was important and what wasn t  and, in my heart of hearts, i wasn t really there to be a lawyer  i think if i d wanted to be a litigator, if i really wanted to go try things before the supreme court, then going to law school, and actually attending the classes and interacting would have been a great exercise  i went there because i thought it was my fastest way to a seat at the table in silicon valley  i wanted to be in the middle of a deal, and have people listen to me, even though they probably shouldn t, because i had very limited experience  but, i wanted to be in the maelstrom, and i knew that if i went and got a kickass law degree with great grades, i could end up at a kickass law firm, in silicon valley, and be a  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    guy who, at 25, 26, they were gonna listen to  where else does that happen? so, that was the path, but yeah, i kicked ass in law school without going to any  i will say this, you might have heard the legend, but the one thing you do need are some notes from some of the classes, to understand which cases the professor brought up, and what they think is important  and so, i threw a keg party every semester, where the only thing you had to bring to get into the party were your notes  so, classmates would bring their notes to the party, throw them in a bin, and then i would go xerox them all  and, build kind of a composite, and use that to study for the exams  tim ferriss   that s genius  and, the notebook that you found not too long ago? this all tracks together, but we re kind of approaching it in a memento type fashion   chris sacca   yeah   tim ferriss   the notebook  tell people about this notebook   chris sacca   yeah, it s funny  just two years ago, i found this in my garage, and it s really   it s been weighing on me, and particularly this week, turning 40  so, i was 19, no, i was 20 years old actually, i was 20  i was living in ireland, going to school there  i spent two of my four years abroad, while at the school of foreign service at georgetown, and so, i m living in ireland, and there was an expat girl in one of my classes, and we were flirting with each other by, basically, taking a notebook, and writing in ten questions for the other person to answer, and then you d get it back, and you d answer ten questions, and write ten new questions  we d pass it back and forth while we were supposed to be studying 20th century irish film, or something like that  and, at one point, one of the questions was, what do you wanna be when you grow up? so, i m 20, i m living in cork, ireland  we basically would start drinking stout around 11 30am, every day  it was like, second and third meal was stout  and, by that point, i d still never heard of an investment banker, i definitely never heard of a venture capitalist  so, i just write in there, i said,  i don t know what the job is called, but i know it s gonna involve a lot of talking on the phone, a lot of negotiating, a lot of yelling at people, high risk, high reward    unbelievably high stakes  i m gonna do it part time from the  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    mountains, part time from the beach, and whatever it is, i m gonna be done with it before i m 40   and so, two years ago, my wife and i are standing in the garage of our mountain house, cleaning it out because we re moving some stuff down to our beach house, and i find this old notebook, and i m like, hey, look at this! and, we re flipping through it, and i find this answer, and i just kind of really choked up  it was this incredibly weird self prophecy, that i kind of laid out exactly what my job was  but, i also felt a certain amount of pressure  like, what do i do now that i m 40? do i keep doing this job, or not? do i need to listen to the scrolls? tim ferriss   right  like, shatter some kind of cosmic continuum if you don t follow the prophecy  so, you do spend a lot of time on the phone, or you have historically  clearly a very good storyteller  what are the words or phrases that you overuse the most?  chris sacca   the words of phrases that i overuse the most? amazing, bananas, coconuts   tim ferriss   is coconuts a close cousin to bananas?  chris sacca   yeah  that is coconuts  i use the phrase that said, a lot, as a transition  you know, transition words are really important, for me, because having   i know you ve studied how to learn other languages  one of the things i always focused on when studying   and i speak spanish  was transition words, like sinbargo  like, nevertheless, you know? like, i needed to have those transition words, because that s how i could tell a good story  that s how i could lay out, we re in a new paragraph  even if you haven t been following me, i got a new concept coming  and, i really think studying it that way, and bringing it back   i used to live in spain, and ecuador, el salvador  i bring that back to my english, and i realize, i m really clear about my transition words now   tim ferriss   so, hard return, that said   chris sacca   yeah, but i am   and you can ask matt mazio, my partner  we write updates to our investors that no other fund does  we write deep, colorful narrative about the state of all of our investments, the state of all of our companies, the state of the industry, our own personal states, what we re thinking about  and, by the time you  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    see one of those as an investor, i ve probably edited that thing, mazio s draft, 15 to 20 times  i m obsessive about writing  it needs to be crisp, original, no repetition of words and phrases, i need to bring it  and, that was something i got directly from my parents, who are both exceptional writers  but, i think in colloquial terms, whenever we re talking with people, i try and emulate whatever the language pattern is of the person i m talking to  it makes them feel better  i don t even think i do it consciously  like, you come to an island like this, it s staffed all by brits  and, you can t help but find your r s suddenly getting a little bit funny, and you re like, okay, okay, hold off  but, i think that s something i really try and focus on, is speaking in the same speed as the person i m talking to  tim ferriss   and, you seem to have had quite the clear picture, as reflected in the hustle, and the notebook, you had this drive that seemed to point in a very particular direction  i know that when i was about to graduate from college, i had no idea of what my next move was, and law school hadn t even entered the realm of consideration  what would your advice be to college students who are just about to graduate, who have no idea what they should focus on, what they should do? do you have any kind of general thoughts or suggestions you would make to someone in that position?  chris sacca   i did give a graduation speech, i think it was two years ago, now? at the university of minnesota, a school i didn t really have any ties to, and they reached out to an agent, who hired me for it  and, that was daunting, right? because i give speeches all the time, and it s usually to a room full of conoco executives in kissimmee, florida, and i m just there for the check  but, a graduation speech is intense  that s hopefully memorable, hopefully formative, hopefully you re talking to people who have incredibly open minds, and it s such a meaningful transition point in their lives  but, what i focused on was, be interesting  i think   you re here for a week where i ve gathered my favorite friends, and one of the reasons why i think the week is so fun, for everybody, is that everyone else here is totally interesting  right? not necessarily a titan of business, but just interesting, compassionate, adventuresome people, who just go for it, who are up for it  and, i think, as i look around who i ve hired, who i like to work  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    with, who i ve hired back, they re interesting  they re people you wanna be around, you wanna spend time with you wanna hear their answers, you want them to influence your thinking  you want them to push you a little bit, to try things that you haven t tried  you want them to teach you  and, if i could give advice to someone who feels like they re looking at a maze of opportunities, and none of them has particularly presented, or they re not sure how they wanna get ahead or distinguish themselves  i think pursuing a course of life that embraces interestingness   and, by the way, i don t think people are born interesting, i think it s actually something you can accrue  living abroad  volunteering for a group like charity water, and going into the field  taking an actual service job  going in, and having meaningful conversations with the people around you, including homeless people, including your neighbors, and people who are actually working for wage  getting involved with politics, briefly  i think i campaigned for obama a couple times  and, i was everything from one of his top fundraisers to, i actually spent time in elko nevada, which put me into the mobile home living rooms of some of the poorest people in the country  who, somehow, were supporting the republican party in that election  it was surreal, but it gave me a life perspective, that i don t think i would ve had otherwise  i think those kinds of things make for much more compelling people, and will start to present career opportunities  tim ferriss   so, one question that i d love to ask is, when you were sort of in your most recent sweet spot of wealth accumulation, whether that s related to what you did with twitter or otherwise, were there any sort of shifts or routines, habits that helped you maintain that sort of peak output, or achieve what you did?  chris sacca   yeah, so, i mean, you know my personal story, so i ve certainly been fortunate to make a bunch of money the last few years  but, in bubble one, i made a bunch of money, levered up   lost it all and a lot more, leaving me millions of dollars in the hole  i was able to work it all back to zero by 2005  and since then, a lot of work, a few ups and downs, but it s worked out pretty well  and, it s looking good for the road ahead too  so, that said, i don t think there s any particular   i don t think i have a calendaring function or an emailing function, or anything like that,  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    that s like a hack  i will say, two things that i think shifted the nature of my business  one was that, before i had really made any money at this, and before i had any business doing this, my then girlfriend, who s now my wife crystal, moved out of silicon valley, up to truckee  i mean, literally took ourselves out of the game as an angel venture investor  how do you manage a venture practice from up in lake tahoe? and yet, what i realized was that, being in the city, i was just playing defense the whole time  i was taking these coffee meetings, listening to these poor pitches being friendly, and kind of obliging people and their ideas, but i d spend all day in these meetings, and i d get home, and i d be like, shit, i haven t actually accomplished anything  i would go to the cocktail and dinner parties i was invited to, but they weren t actually the people i wanted to spend the time with  and so, i was just reacting to everything, rather than actually going out and playing offense  and so, crystal and i moved up to tahoe, and we quite literally built a list of people we wanted to know better  and, we just started inviting them to come up and stay with us in tahoe  you were definitely one of those people, right, and you came up and spent a lot of time with us there  we, i also started writing lists of the companies i wanted to get to know better, and i just went in deep with them, and asked them to come up to tahoe  and, so, i was playing offense now, and i had a perfect excuse why i couldn t get coffee with all the randoms  like, hey, i m sorry, i m not in san francisco, i m three hours away  there were a couple obsessives, who drove all the way up there  but, for the most part, i was able to pick and choose the interactions i felt were going to be most valuable, to me, to my wife, and to my business  and, that was a huge shift, and it was risky as hell, because i mean, i couldn t even really afford the house we bought up there when we first bought it   600,000, 3bedroom house  and, i certainly didn t have a strong enough brand, that i could afford to just walk away from the game  but, i made a conscious decision to play offense from up there, and that really worked out  i mean, i got to know guys like you really well  travis spent a lot of time at our house, evan williams and jason goldman from the twitter team, we had teams like the loku guys, was a great deal we just sold to godaddy  we just had many, many teams, as well as many friends  ted rheingold, who founded  inaudible  now copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    coo at one of our hottest companies  inventure was a guy we got to know very well from staying at our house, david yulivitch, who s the owner and founder of open dns  a guy we got to know really well staying at our place, in truckee  and so, these are people we just go deep with  garrett camp spent some time there, and just a really, really cool crew, that we got to know much better, and built much more meaningful relationships, breaking bread, making dinner, hiking, skiing, that kind of stuff  the second thing that i think was different was that, after a couple of years of trying to explain to people why twitter was gonna be a real business   people would look at me and be like, how are they ever gonna make any money? it s like, man, if you don t see that  so, i finally said, fuck it  i m not here to convince you anymore, i m just gonna buy all of your stock  and, there was a bit that flipped for me  as a seed investor, you have to be very collaborative, you re constantly trying to bring people basically into your worldview, and say, okay, do you see the future of this company? this is why you wanna invest in the company on a series a or series b, this is why you wanna buy it, this is why you wanna work there  and, i got so fed up with doing it on twitter, i was just like, fuck it, if you can t see it anymore, then you don t deserve to make any money on this company  i was just like, unhand the fucking shares, i ll take them  and so, i just started buying that stock up from early investors who wanted to bail, etc , and by the time of the ipo, my affiliated funds that were doing this owned more of it than anybody else  we had 18 percent of the company, and so, that worked  so, there s a few times where it wasn t necessarily the most polite or political way to go about this thing  it certainly was daunting, the amount of money i had to raise to buy that much of the company  tim ferriss   yeah   chris sacca   but, the bit just flipped for me, and i was just like, fuck it, i m not gonna play this traditionally anymore   tim ferriss   just to touch on one aspect of that, i know we have to get ready for dinner and run in a few minutes, so we ll wrap up and maybe do a round two sometime, if people like this   chris sacca   by the way, it s  70s disco night tonight, are you ready?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   oh, you have no idea how ready i am  i sacrificed luggage space for all my other stuff so i could get my disco gear here   chris sacca   wait, so could i just ask the luggage space question?  tim ferriss   yes   chris sacca   is that why you insisted on wearing the speedo when you swim here? please tell me there s some reason other than   at lunch, we came to the conclusion that you might actually be aspiring to be a 70 year old german man, at some point  that s the path your life is on   tim ferriss   i actually am   chris sacca   bruce jenner is on a path to transition to womanhood, and you re on a path to transition into a 70 year old german man   tim ferriss   i was thinking more of a greek man  because i saw this photo   no, actually it wasn t a photo  there was this man walking down the beach, passing me and a friend, and i was in these really baggy board shorts, like, cool fucking brazilian surfer style  horrible to swim in, by the way, it s like swimming with a parachute behind you  but, walking down, and this greek guy wanders by, and he s got these blue skivvies on, that are just, like, his gut s hanging down, covering 70 percent of them  covered, obviously with silverback hair, massive gold chains, could not look fucking happier  and, he just gave zero fucks about our opinion, whatsoever  so, i was just like, i need to put on the training bra  if i m gonna get to that point  so, i do wear the speedos when i get the chance to   chris sacca   no, your power move was, you came to the lunch table today, on the beach, with regular trunks on, and everyone commented, like, oh, thank god, tim wore regular trunks  and you almost, as you walked toward the beach, you dropped your regular trunks  they almost   were they tearaways? and revealed the speedo  and then proceeded to swim   tim ferriss   well, the excuse that i ll use is, part of the reason i feel like i failed to learn to swim for a long time was partially a wardrobe malfunction  because i d wear these baggy shorts that would hold me back  so, this is my effort to be more dolphin like, and less drowning monkey like   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    chris sacca   well, it does work in the water, it s just on land   tim ferriss   on land, it can be a bit offensive to the more sensitive americans among us  but, yes, it does take up less space  you can fold it up and put it in a pocket   chris sacca   i really wanted to believe you weren t wearing those because you like them, as much as it was a luggage efficiency thing   tim ferriss   one of the instructors, i think one of the guys doing kite surfing here, was like, is he wearing those seriously, or ironically, or what?  chris sacca   he did ask that   tim ferriss   so, on a completely unrelated note, where the fuck was i gonna go with that? who knows? tell you what, i know we re tight for time, so i will   two last questions, and then maybe we can revisit this another time  but, is there any purchase that you have made, could be years ago, could be recently, of less than  100, that had a significantly positive impact on your life?  chris sacca   okay, just off the top of my head, the first thing that jumped up off the top of my head was, there s a buckminster fuller book called i seem to be a verb  incredibly, incredibly limited production  you have to buy it vintage if you re gonna find it  i regret even saying it out loud now, because there are so few copies out there, they ll be hoovered up by your audience   tim ferriss   they re gone   chris sacca   but that book, and it s special  it s beautiful inside  it s not like his other books, which are just long, long texts  it s graphic lettering  and photographs, and you read it through on the top half first, and then you flip it over, and you read it through on the bottom half in the other direction  it s super compelling, there are some great thoughts in there  it ll cost you   i mean, i don t know what your viewers are gonna do to the market, but it s under  100, it s incredibly special and treasured   tim ferriss   awesome  yeah, those ll disappear pretty quickly, so get them while they re hot, i guess  any last pieces of advice, or recommendations to leave with the would be entrepreneurs who are listening to this? people who are thinking of starting a company of some type, thinking that s their path  maybe they re  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    just a shitty employee, like i was, and are out there, hoping to have a head start in some way, and advantage  what advice or recommendations would you make? chris sacca   my first recommendation is, be honest with yourself, most people aren t that person  and, i think we are in an environment right now where there is so much venture capital, and the tech industry has been shown to be so cool, great perks and a fast pass to a fast path to wealth, that s very attractive right now, to poseurs  and, i think most people aren t cut out to be founders  most people aren t the entrepreneurs who will have that ultimate success  and, it s polluted our industry  we have way too many shitty companies, that are pulling all the talent away from inevitably great companies  we have way too many people wasting time on competitive ventures that have no hope whatsoever  and so, i think you have to be really, really honest, are you a founder, or are you an employee? and, one of those things that we touched on earlier is that inevitability of success  if you are   people, ask me what went through my head when i lost  12 million in the matter of a week   tim ferriss   and that was   how did you lose that?  chris sacca   and, another  4 million on top of that, just a really high levered public market bet, which went upside down in a crash, and then  4 million from there, leaving me deep, deep in the hole  and people ask, were you sad, were   and my brain works in a way where, i wasn t sad, i was pissed, it was a bummer  but, i knew i would always make that money back, and get back into a good spot again  it was just gonna take longer  i just knew that i would never be the guy who declared bankruptcy and lived in the hole the whole time  i just knew i would make back the millions of dollars, and go from there  when i went out and branched out, and started my own firm, i spent money to do the documents that a big, big firm would do, right off the bat  even though my lawyer s like, we don t really need to do this, it s a small firm, and i was like, well, this is gonna be a huge thing  so, i wanna do that now  when i set out to raise  1 billion, in the fall of 2010, that was absurd  i didn t even have office space  i had one other employee at the time, who managed our back office from a winery in healdsburg, and so, i had no business raising that money  i wore cowboy shirts the whole time, and  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    rarely left truckee, california to do it, asked everyone to fly their fancy jets into truckee to do it, and get it done at the greasy spoon  and so, i just knew that there was an inevitability that this was gonna work out, and that i wouldn t fail at it  if you re not the kind of person to think that way, if you really don t have that gene, where you know it is going to work out  know, you don t hope, you know  then, you shouldn t be a founder  so, i hope that doesn t depress anybody, but hopefully i m saving a bunch of pain  tim ferriss   i think there are also many paths to amassing incredible fortunes, and being a founder is actually a pretty thin slice of that pie  and, a very high risk way to approach things  what is the movie that you can quote from most readily?  chris sacca   the big lebowski  i mean, you start from the opening scene  sam, and i can recite the whole thing  i go to lebowski fest every year  my division at google was secret, we were working on secret stuff, that now you re starting to see, the spectrum and wireless systems and stuff, that they did  we actually launched the first weather balloons  cassidy went on to launch lune and stuff like that  we dug the fiber, etc  but that whole division was called project lebowski  and, if you, every time we launched something, or achieved a milestone, everybody got achiever shirts it s, uh, you know?  little lebowski urban achievers, inner city children of promise without the necessary means for, necessary means for a higher education   so, phillip seymour hoffman, rest in peace  so, that was, it s a pretty important movie for me   tim ferriss   awesome  where can people find you on the internets, and i ll give one more book recommendation  since the bucky book is probably gonna vanish  the magic of thinking big is one i found quite helpful  i think you might as well  but, on the nets?  chris sacca   are we giving book recommendations right now?  tim ferriss   sure   chris sacca   you know one of my favorite, favorite books?  tim ferriss   what s that?  chris sacca   it s the essential scratch and sniff guide to becoming a wine  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    expert  coauthored by my fabulous wife  it, literally, you know, the master sommelier, richard betts  there s incredible knowledge in that book  so, my wife and wendy mcnaughton the illustrator teamed up to make a children s book for adults that ll teach you how to drink wine  it s indispensable for any entrepreneur  tim ferriss   that s super fun  i might have to have betts on at some point, to talk about hacking the master somme test   chris sacca   that s exactly what he does  he teaches people to take that test   tim ferriss   oh, i know, we had a long lunch and talked about it  he s a fascinating dude  so, the web, the ever expanding web of sacca?  chris sacca   i m  on twitter, and i just don t use the instagrams anymore  i m also  on periscope  and that, i ve been using a lot  i think periscope changes everything   tim ferriss   cool, man  speaking about changing everything, it s disco night, so we gotta get running   chris sacca   that s right, that s right   tim ferriss   alright, thanks brother  nice one   chris sacca   thanks, tim   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    "
127,132,132: Chris Sacca ,"  hello, boys and girls, children, and squirrels, this is tim ferriss and welcome to another episode of the tim ferris show  this is not one of my normal deconstruction episodes where i interview someone  this is an in betweenisode, but a very, very valuable one, i hope  it is with chris sacca, who is recently the cover story of the midas issue of forbes magazine  he was on the cover because he is a newly minted billionaire and the proprietor of what will likely be the most successful venture capital fund in history, lowercase one  he s an early stage investor companies like twitter, uber, instagram, kickstarter and many more  also wears cowboy shirts, has a gray beard, and is hilarious  in this episode, he answers all of your most pressing questions, and they were voted upon, and he takes the most popular, the most interesting, and give some fantastic responses ranging from life advice to business advice and everything in between  without further ado, please enjoy this episode with chris sacca  chris sacca  how s it going, everybody? this is chris sacca, but because of this microphone and these headphones, and this fancy podcasting setup that tim ferriss made me go buy so that i could do this update with you, i m feeling pretty hip hop right now if you look at me  i asked some of you for suggestions for the name  i like sir tweets a lot, the unicorn chief aka dj sacajawea, aka mc140, aka saketumi, maybe dj term streets, cowboy shark, mcvc, or even saccacon  i think i ll go by any of those handles and more  in fact, at the end of listening to this, if you have other suggestions for my dj handle, just put them up on twitter  meanwhile, you, guys, were very cool to put up a bunch of questions on reddit  following my discussion with tim, it s always fun to talk to tim that particular discussion was in the midst of my 40th birthday celebration, so we were foggy but having a good time  i really appreciate the question you, guys, put up  i am going to try and tackle a bunch of them  tim asked me to do 5 or 10, but let s see how many we can bang out for real life responsibilities catch up to me  one of the first questions i saw was hiring and finding a good technical co founder versus exporting to a mobile web development company to retain equity  this is always challenging just because i think one of the first questions i get asked very frequently is where do i find a good technical co founder  i think you can just go to where the geeks are hanging out virtually and physically  you can go to hackathons, you can hang out in github, in hacker news, and in places where geeks are  i think you ll find that if you re nontechnical yourself, you ll find you re actually more helpful than you probably thought you were or that you could be  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved       i would encourage you to just not find the process of finding a technical co founder so daunting as much as you may be envious of their coding skills, they probably have a quiet respect for the other things at which you can be helpful, the other aspects of the business as well  that said, what i ve seen when people outsource their mobile and web development, particularly for a tech oriented company, is that just put a glass ceiling on the company  you usually can get a first and a quicker round 1 and round 2 of your product, get your mvp out there, but then you re stuck with the code base that you can t really expound upon or improve in any way, and you end up tearing it down starting from the beginning  at a time when your users are most excited, and you re most excited about building something for the future, you don t really have the tools to improve it  that s been incredibly frustrating  i think double down, get that technical co founder right upfront and i think that will put you in the best spot  the last part of your question is about retaining equity  don t be short sighted about retaining equity in the early days  anyone who s going to come on and be worthwhile is going to be worth a chunk in the company and if they re not, take it back  the next question here  if you were to give a commencement speech tomorrow, what would your message be? my first message would be congratulations to all of you who are graduating in january  those have a much longer spring break  it will be great for them  that s it  i gave a commencement speech in minnesota few years ago  i was pretty proud of it  i think it s probably youtubable, and tim has a great way of posting links of these things on a site  chris sacca  when i was at carlson school of management up at the university of minnesota, and i will say it was funny because they contract me for that speech through my agent  we agreed upon a fee  i put a lot of heart and soul every time i talk publicly, and so i showed up to do a speech  i didn t realize they actually had me give the same speech 3 times to 3 different graduations that day  that was intense, but i had a really great time  they filled up this hockey arena in 3 times i gave a speech and i actually think i got better  i took notes  i saw which jokes got no reaction and gave the speech  the core of it was to be your unapologetically weird self  i think authenticity is one of the most lacking things out there these days and that as people strive to all, had their life, their resume and their credentials, we ve started to miss out on some of the fun educations that makes life interesting, and that make us want to be around other people, and that make us helpful, and valuable  i spent an hour or so going on that stuff, so i encourage you to go check out now because i think it holds up now  next question, what are the keys to success for an amazing disco night  good memory  when tim and i did the podcast originally, it was indeed about to be disco on necker island  we were on richard branson s island, celebrating my 40th birthday and i gather a bunch of great friends  tim was there and, man, it was just a week of really competitive athletics during the day, intense, backend and chess matches, debates about the future of tech, lot of heavy drinking, and partying, and dancing, and you name it  we re lucky to have richard branson and a bunch of fun people there with us  what i found from over my years of going to parties that either i ve hosted or that copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved       other people have hosted, if you could bring one thing to make for an amazing party night, it s wigs, seriously  go to amazon right now and order 50 mullet wigs  mullet wigs change everything  i was at a party recently, a good buddy of mine s 50th birthday party and the crew that he had there was a mix of people, some were serious business associates, others are really fun, aggressive party people, there are some athletes, some artists, there are all walks of life, different cultures, too  i brought a bag of 75 or so mullet wigs, and i just opened it up, and i laid them out on a couch off to one of the sides of the party  it was amazing  it didn t take 15 minutes before people found their way over there, even someone like the stage financial people went over there, found themselves a mullet wig that they felt best represented who they are and what they stood for, maybe it was a dog, the bounty hunter style, maybe it was a real short long, maybe it was just a bandana that had a rat tail coming down off the back of it  everyone had an opportunity to express themselves and the party just kicked up a notch  it s incredibly inclusive and what you find to is they re even great for women, so like a brunette will put on a blonde mullet wig vice verse, it s fun  the key to an amazing disco night, because you asked, mullet wigs  what are the cases where startups should not take investor money? i think startup should be very wary of taking investor money if they haven t really checked their guts and made sure that their expectations of what is considered a success lines up with what the venture investors expectations of success are  there is this whole category of businesses called lifestyle businesses that you ll hear mention with disdain in the venture community as if those companies are some kind of failure  the lifestyle business usually refers to something that s not growing particularly fast but it s throwing off enough cash for the founder and the employees to live comfortable and no arguments here, but it s not growing 10x year over year  it doesn t look like it s going to go public anytime soon  that s a lifestyle business  generally, vcs look down on lifestyle businesses because they, themselves, the vcs have investors whose expectations are huge rack, stacks of chatter being pass to them at the end of the vc bond  when a vc puts money into a company that evolves to become a lifestyle business, that s a bad result for a venture investor and yet that might be a great result for you, the founder  in fact, you guys are all fans of tim, and if you read tim s books, and follow the people he highlights, many of them have successful pulled off lifestyle businesses, work relatively balanced hours, generate income, live by the beach, have some control of your own destiny, that s great  it s like the definition of american success but that doesn t necessarily align with what a lot of investors are looking  i think you shouldn t take investor money unless you are confident that you and your investors define success in the same way  which person would you most like tim to interview? tim and i talked about this sometimes and he s approached me about people that he wants to interview, but i have a different take on it  i would like to see tim interviewed by somebody else  i would like to see tim interviewed by god  does that work? does that sound like god right now? tim, it s god here  it s been a while  i haven t heard much from you since you started having copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved       sam harris on the podcast  anyway, let s dive in  question number 1, your fridge is constantly filled with your own blood and urine samples yet you keep praying to me, asking me to convince the perfect girl to settle down with you  drawing any correlations here, my little tim tim? i think tim just learned that there are much deeper cause to having your friends by their own audiovisual equipment for your podcast  the question was who should tim interview  i think i want to turn the tables on that  i think tim is an amazing interviewer  he s got a really unique perspective on identifying guest, convincing them to come on the show, the kinds of questions he asked them, what he learns from them and translates to all of us to be able to act on  it s unique in this world  tim really is one of the best interviewers in media  that said, very infrequently does anyone interview tim and as a longtime friend of tim s i know where some of the bodies are buried  i ve been with him through thick and thin  i think we have some other fellow friends who do as well  what i propose is that we bring back a panel of interviews from past episodes to turn the tables on tim, put him under the light and see what we can get out of him  i want to hear what you, guys, think about that and team up on your socials, and let s see if that s a doable thing  one of you ask, what s your best advice for getting down to business when it s getting tough, whether that would be working a late night, or just going for a run  in my mind, those are 2 really different categories but i think i might undertake those challenges differently  in my world, the physical challenge always just seems so surmountable  you can go just get it done  it s finite  you go out for a run and you know how many miles you re going to run, or you run until you stop running but with more intellectual pursuits, it feels like there s no finish line there  it s always really challenging for me because i feel like i could always be doing more and i don t always know when something is done like i do with the physical challenge  i m even more prone to distraction when i m doing something that s not inherently physical  as a result, if i really want to get some shit down, i first focus on the physical space  i want to be out of the way  i want to be clear of visual distraction, of audio distraction  i usually have some headphones on even if they re not actually playing music  more about that in a second  i make sure nothing else is on the desk  we have people who come and look at my workspace and laugh because there are no papers  i got fax machines out of my life in 2006 or  07, or something like that  i really don t have things in the space in which i want to get something done  i create digital space for myself, so i turn off all notifications  we have a committee called rescue time that tim and i are both investors and advisors, and that has a tool that will just basically shut off all the other distractions for you in your desktop environment, but your phone on  do not disturb   you re not going to miss anything  music wise, sometimes i just wear headphones without even focusing on whether there s particularly good music with them  they send a signal, even a social signal, i am not to be interrupted  that said, i know a lot of people put classical music on but i wouldn t jump to the assumption that that s what works best for your brain  strangely enough, when i was in law school, a dirty little secret of mine that i ever went to law school and copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved       was a lawyer, but i could not sit still through reading the most boring of books  i tried a bunch of different music types and weirdly what worked for me were grateful dead bootlegs  there were something about them even though they had lyrics that were something about a melodically that i could just zone out that conscious part of my brain and instead focus on reading the books  for me these days, i listen to a combination of new age and stuff like that like andreas vollenweider, george winston for piano, but i also have been known to put on hip hop tracks on repeat and i know that some of these have been discussed in the podcast before  macmillan wag 00 16 44 , who s a good friend and a guy whose company i ve invested in  he listened to the same track over and over again when he s coding  i do the same thing when i m writing  i will just have a song on repeat  some of those songs i ve included the harlem shake believe it or not  i can bang through an amazing amount of email with the harlem shake going on in the background  i listened to that song lift off by j and b  i ve just put that thing on repeat for over and over again before to get something done  i think i cranked out a few thousand words with that actually in the background, so who knows? generally, what all of this comes down to is whether you are on offense or defense  i think that as you survey the challenges in your lives, it s just which of those did you assign yourself and which of those are you doing to please someone else? are you out there actually working off your own to do list, or are you letting everybody else write your to do list for you via your inbox? i think being on offense requires more work  you have to do the work of writing down the to dos, of creating the space in which to get it done, of planning the execution, of pushing everything else aside prioritizing your work  i think before we even get to how you arrange your physical space and your digital space, and what s in your head, and getting your food and nutrition right, making sure you have a glass of water, making sure you ve gone to the john  i think the number 1 thing you can do is focusing on am i doing this thing for me, or am i doing this thing for someone else  okay, you asked, if you could move your family to anywhere in the world and start fresh, what country would you move to? i don t know about starting fresh  i don t i necessarily want to start fresh right now  i ve got a pretty good setup  that said, at multiple points in my life, i ve certainly uprooted everything and moved even when it didn t make any sense to  some of you don t notice but despite being what people continually refer to as a silicon valley investor, i haven t actually lived in san francisco since 2007  i moved to truckee, california, up in the lake tahoe, amazing place to live, a great place to live but certainly not a tech hotbed as we think of it  by that time, i really hadn t made real money in the investing game  there i was the aspiring venture investor moving away from the epicenter of silicon valley to a rural region, up in the woods, in the mountains  i did that though because as i referenced earlier, i was going on offense  i was sick of doing coffee after coffee, after coffee of just routine meetings in san francisco and instead i wanted to go on offense  i wanted to have the time to focus, to learn the things i wanted to learn, build what i wanted to build and copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved       really invest in a relationships that i wanted to grow rather than just doing a day of coffee after coffee, after coffee  i moved up to lake tahoe  again, on paper, it didn t make any sense at all  as for the few years, just as things in the lake tahoe were starting to really make sense  my wife, crystal, and i on 2 weeks notice decided to buy a house in la and starts putting our time in los angeles  neither of us had ever lived there before  we didn t really have any business there at all  it just felt like the right thing to do for us  again, people read into it like,  oh, chris is endorsing the la startup scene or something   there wasn t any bigger than that  it was just crystal and i decided that that s what made the most sense for us at that time, and so we did it  we made that jump  we love la, but last year, we made another jump to montana  we found that there are some things we wanted to do and to experience that were in montana that weren t in los angeles, and weren t in truckee  i embody that spirit of just picking up and moving my family  we have 3 kids now, and so picking up moving my family and it s an adventure, and it s fun, and i think it teaches them flexibility, adaptability  it certainly makes you question how many things you on because it s hard to move all your stuff, so you end up owning less stuff  that said, i think the thing that reminds of that i m most grateful for is how every time i ve made one of those moves, i ve done it by choice  i think there are too many people on this planet right now who don t have that control over their own destiny or force to make much more drastic moves not by their own choice whether it s on one extreme a syrian refugee or on the other extreme someone in the united states who s losing their house, or whose job has been downsized  i think it s a moment for reflection that as much as i really enjoy the culture of lifestyle design implicit and it has to be some gratitude  we re fortune enough to make these kinds of choices  ultimately, my family will live outside the country significantly  we have 3 kids under 5 right now, so we re letting everybody grew up a little bit, but my wife grew up all over the world  i want to have that same experience for my kids, too  i want them to be exposed to the human condition  i want them to know people of every color  i want them to learn other languages and just have that broad human experience that i don t think you can get living in a wealthy suburb of a major usc  chris, in light of your admiration of buckminster fuller and fascination with sci fi and musings about the future, what are your thoughts on how human societies can adapt to the increasing speed of tech advancement  then there were some other questions like this  how do you see your family s day to day life changing as virtual reality comes to prominence, artificial intelligence starts replacing a significant number of jobs  biotext are changing our lifespans and we begin to colonize other planets  oh, man, this is got dark  first of all, let me say planet colonization is not a short term concern of mine  the physical limitation to space travel render pretty low on the list for me  it just not going to come up for myself, maybe my kids, grandkids, probably but it s not high on the list for me  unless you know something about hyperspace, i don t know it yet, so let me know  oozing back on this other question that i think are truly tough questions about the impact of technology in societal adaptation  i am concern  we approach a lot of the stuff with this universal embrace of progress by with a really engineering centric focus on what the copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved       measures of progress are  when we think about each year at ces, they show a display with more and more resolution and they show a virtual reality headset with less and less latency, and their incredible technical achievements  yet what i worry about it that those displays our outpacing the rate of our biological and physiological adaptation  yes ago, someone gave me a sony psp or somebody at sony gave me a psp and i was playing grand theft auto  when i got to the airport, i got in my car and started driving in realized i was driving incredibly aggressively  i was a really asshole driver all of a sudden and it was my brain hadn t totally distinguished between the fiction of that game even though, again, you know the psp s tiny screen, weird controls, lot of latency, but my brain   there s neural pathway i ve been created that told my brain that   it confused it  was that real or was that fiction? when i got to the real highway, i was driving recklessly  now, i m not making an argument for game censorship, et cetera  i don t want to make this into a bigger discussion, but the reality is that if you ve tried a vr headset now, you know  your brain doesn t really know what the hell is going on, walk up to the edge and you feel fear  you look down and it s scary  that s one of the things that s interesting is that one after one, these advances are technical achievements and i m really impressed by teams that build these, but i don t think we re making the same investment in the biological and psychological ramifications of some of these things  i don t think it s all bad at all  i m an optimist  you asked me a buckminster fuller and he is the optimist when it comes to technology  he was the believer that tech could solve all of our problems  he held steadfast that technological progress would ensure that the whole planet s needs could be met in terms of food and education, natural resources, and yet i am and sure you see a digital divide, their haves and have nots, healthcare divide and education divide, the criminal justice divide, a nutrition divide and yet much of the tech available today doesn t seem to be improving those situations very much  i have this interesting lesson in this  years ago, when i worked at google, i was working for larry and sergey  we had an opportunity to partner with walmart on a big project  it was related to the wireless stuff  we realized there were about 4,000 or so walmart locations in the united states, and if we put a cellular tower on top of each of them that would have been a great way to build a wireless network  that was one of the things i was focused on back then  i once made some offhanded comment about how partnering with walmart would be that would be a dark day for me  larry and sergey asked,  why? what do you mean?  i said,  you guys are fans of walmart?  they said,  yeah, it s like the triumph of efficiency  think of that  think of all the money that s been saved by consulting everything into massive purchasing power and bringing down cost rather supply chain and central distribution hubs like that  it s an amazing triumph   they saw it as an engineering and economic exercise  who can blame them? they re one of the most successful engineering and economic pairs ever, but as someone who grew up in a small town where the downtown was replaced by a walmart out of the center of copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved       town, i saw walmart as the catalyst for a lot of american downtowns being abandoned  i saw a lot of people losing their jobs and their identities, and the control over their own destinies  it was interesting to be sitting in that room with them and have those 2 completely different perspectives on that company because of how we d grown up and what we ve been exposed to in the lens through which we saw the world and how we evaluated successful outcomes  to bring this back to your question about the future of technology and societal adaptation, one of the things i think it s hard for me to do is to put myself always in the shoes of those who are going to end up on the wrong end of these equations  one of you asked a question somewhere postulated that it would be something like in the future, 30  of us would have it good and 70  of us will have it bad  i actually think in this current path it s going to be way worse than that  there were way fewer people who have it good and the rest will struggle  in the old economy where people used to have careers and pensions, and benefits, that doesn t exit anymore  it s been replaced by people who are called associates who work hourly, who don t really qualify for benefits, who don t have a safety net  there s scary implications to that  i saw a comment recently on twitter about how the future will basically be 10 trillionaires and the rest of us will be taking trends serving venti espressos to each other and driving around in each other s ubers  obviously, that s intensely dystopian, but there s a trend line pointed in that direction  yet what i worry about is that it s hard for those of us who are even listening to this podcast right now to parse that because when you think about your day, when you think about your month and your year, and your life up to this point, i like you would like to think that i hustled to get here  i can point to all the times i work my ass off, but the reality is apart from just the advantages of being white and a male, and native english speaker with an american passport, in my case, i was always as smart as hell  i went to college for math starting in 7th grade and i ve always known that if there s a system somewhere, i ll figure it out  i ll hack it  that s the challenge is that how do i begin to perceive the fear and the anxiety, and the hopelessness, and even the helplessness in a system if i just know in my heart that i will always figure out a way to come out on top  that s the myopia that concerns me the most and that s what i think is so prevalent in silicon valley today is that silicon valley is populated mostly by folks who would consider themselves winners of the traditional race, people who floated to the top of their education institutions who have succeeded in the ranks of their traditional businesses, who have taken risks, entrepreneurial risks and who have had great success, and yet all of that has contributed to the exclusion of a lot of the voices that i consider to be vital in a worthy society in a round and robust, and exciting society but they ve just been beyond gentrification  they re just not voices you interact with much in silicon valley today and in a tech world today  i think that myopia, it concerns me because i think it s actually going to end up costing up as an industry a lot of success but i also think a lack of empathy there is going to lead to more social and political unrest  this country, there s a really good shot that unravels  this leads into one of you asked a question that says,  chris, you recommended 2 books copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved       on the first podcast  how to make millions in rising asia and then the other book is not fade away, both to cultivate a more empathetic perspective, why empathy and what got you there, and what is everyone missing?  i think i touched on a lot of that already, but as a builder, as an entrepreneur, how can you build something for someone else if you don t have even enough glancing familiarity with them to imagine the world through their eyes? how can you define the feature set? how can you think about pricing? i might not care about  i don t care about a  4 99 app installed but almost everyone on the planet does  how can you build something with identity and heart? you re building it for an audience you don t really know  sometimes you ve been locked into it and sometimes audiences have problems they, themselves, don t understand  there s an incredible amount of empathy i think missing in the system today  i think you don t have to look far to understand why there s so much political discord particularly when   i think those of us in tech 10 either be progressive or libertarian, but generally, within the tech world there s been a lot of animosity toward those in the extreme right, the anti science right, and yet i don t think you have to look far to understand where that comes from  you ve got a huge group of people in the united states who have basically lost the control over their own destiny, the small businesses that used to run have gone away  they ve lost their farms, they ve lost their houses, they ve lost their ability to plot their own future  when they get up in the morning, committed to work hard, they don t necessarily know that it s going to work out for them  if that were you, you d probably be looking for scapegoats, too  now, i think some of those scapegoats are misplaced and the blame isn t laid in the right place, but underlying that there was a certain amount of empathy and part of that is because i ve gone and spent time with those people, and try to understand their plight  i think those of us who will take that time, invest in that understanding, our lives will be richer for it, our societies will be stronger for it, our kids will be better for it, and i think our products and the services we offer will actually play out a lot better as well  is that a long enough answer for you? chris, if you were to start your own school to educate youth, how would you do it? what would you concentrate on? how much would you pay the teachers? is education the answer to the world s problems? presuppose that you weren t using schools to just train your kid to be successful with air quotes around it  think about how the purpose of education up to this point has always been,  if you do well in school, you can get into a great college, get into a great college maybe get into a great grad school and then you can get a great job   that has been the basically baseline underlying assumption for education system for at least a generation now, probably 2, and yet imagine if that weren t the case  i was lucky  i went to the school of foreign service at georgetown, one of the most competitive schools in the country and among my peers were kids who went to all the fanciest boarding schools, all the best prep schools, all the best high schools  i went to a public high school  i went there with absolute trepidation that i would just get trampled by these kids and while their life experiences are certainly more diverse and exciting than mine because they had the money to do all kinds of cool things, and they had ap classes and stuff that i copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved       didn t necessarily have, spending time with them, i realized that their world views were incredibly narrow  most of them have never worked or lived among poor people  most of them hadn t actually volunteered  most of them hadn t had service jobs, tipping jobs  they hadn t worked manual labor  same went on when i worked in silicon valley with top harvard and stanford grads at google and beyond, all across the valley, same kind of thing  i found people who were incredibly successful with those air quotes and yet had very unidimensional lives  back to your question, if i were to start my own school, what if you started a school that presupposed the goal was happy kids  i mean, happy with a capital h, balanced, thoughtful and passionate, doers  what if their resume wouldn t ever matter? some of you have heard me say before that the only people who care about your gp are people who you ve given no other basis to evaluate you  what if instead you wanted to build an education that fostered interesting  ideas 00 35 01 , understanding, action, experience? i don t know what that school looks like but that s how my wife, crystal, and i have been approaching, raising our 3 daughters  i ve yet to see test scores correlate with happiness  i ve yet to even see test scores correlate with learning with a capital l, and so i don t know what i would do to reinvent the education system or any particular school but it s certainly on top of mind for me  one of you asked,  can you elaborate on the ironman you completed in 2008? what real world transferable lessons did you learn?  the ironman i did, i actually did 2 of them 5 weeks apart  one was just a training session where i realized there s going to be so much training that day  i was like,  okay, let s just do the whole ironman   i did a formal sanctioned ironman few weeks later  i had a phrase i keep repeating in my head over and over again which was,  tonight, i will be on my bed  tonight, i will be on my bed  tonight, i will be on my bed   it was something i just repeated to remind me that the pain of what i was going through is temporary and that no matter what, at the end of that day, i would be in my bed that night  in 2009, i rode my bike across the country  it was a 40 day trip with 35 days of riding, incredibly intense, almost 100 miles a day, and i hadn t trained for it all  i friend of mine gave me the trip about 2 weeks before i left, and so i showed up to the west coast muffin topping out of my leg shorts  i couldn t emanate the parts of my bike  i just bought a bike  actually, i didn t even have a road bike at that time i agreed to do it  i d given away my tri bike, but i use the same principle there during one of the most painful experience of my life just every time i would say tonight, i ll be on my bed  i don t know if you can translate that to everything you do in the real world but try it  someone asked,  you re more inclined to invest, a founder who has a proven entrepreneurial track record or someone who s a first time founder but a seasoned professional with relevant expertise in the area that we ll be competing   i really worry  expertise is going to be a contraindicator  think about the uber founder, travis, garrett, ryan, none of them had ever driven cabs before or limos  what i think i found is that experience often deeply embeds the assumptions that need to be questioned in the first place  when you have experience of something, you don t notice the things that are new about it  you don t notice the idiosyncrasies that need to be tweaked  you copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved       don t notice where the air gaps are  one of the things i ve always admired about evan williams as an entrepreneur is his ability to see the assumptions that the rest of us are taken for granted  on the other hand, i don t always think track records play out  i do not automatically back someone who had a great first exit  i don t think that s a necessarily determinant  surely there are founders who go on the shows time and again  they are capable of building cool stuff, but often what happens is you ll see that second time founder malley s where if they ve already exited, they might not have that same fire in their belly  you have to test those assumptions  they may keep making every decision based upon what they did the last time around even though there s new fax this time  they may try and pattern match  that can be distracting, so be careful about that  next question was,  chris, i know this is a tired subject and hopefully one day we won t have to talk about it anymore, but what are some of the ways vcs can bring more diversity to their firms and more diversity to their portfolios? women and people of color are underrepresented on both sides of the table  truth is, it doesn t really matter what you re doing, a diversity of thought is good for business  why the reluctance from vc?  i m glad you brought it up  it s not a tired subject and it s not going to get better unless we talk about it, and i m glad  i m glad there s awareness  i m glad people are talking about it, but here s one thing that i think is going to end up fixing it in the end for us  it s greed  the reality is that these underrepresented talents, women and people of color, and the lgbt community, one of the interesting things about this is that they all represent huge communities of disposable income with unique product desires, with unique tastes  these are huge economies that have largely been ignored  what happens is silicon valley has invested in the things that they understand, and the things that white guys get to the chagrin of these other founders  as a result, they ve missed the big markets  we get credit for being early styleseat investors and yet what was funny was we invested in styleseat because we liked melody and we thought she had some hustle  i had no idea how big that market was until my wife, crystal, explain to me how big that market was and how much women actually spent on their hair  then later when i check back in with melody, i learned how much african american women spend on their hair as a percentage of disposable income  it was huge and i start to learn about this huge, huge economy, and so i put more money of the company, and then i took a route to help tell the story up and down  saint hill road  and she was ignored because most white guys don t pay more than 20 bucks to get their haircut  they have no idea what it cost to get a color, what it costs to get a weave, what it costs to get a digital perm if you have asian hair  no idea  it turns out that s an incredibly successful company going after a huge market  now, there are a lot of white guys who are figuring that out and the company has succeeded as a result of having   it s led by a woman who s incredibly successful leader with a dynamic management team of women  it s going to be a success story and i think the next time people get approach with a deal like that, they re going to remember that  similar company that we have old inventure, it s absolutely revolutionizing how a credit works in a mobile environment particularly in the developing world led by a woman copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved       name shivani siroya  shivani would be easy to underestimate and i ll bring up just her physical stature by way of this prejudice but she is like a short indian woman and it would be easy in the traditional big glad handing white guy venture capital world to just walk past her and say like,  she can t be up to anything incredible   if i were in a room looking for whose company i was going to invest in, i probably would have ignored her  the circumstance  inaudible  we met were i was seated next to her at dinner and i asked her what she was up to, and 2 1 2 hours later, i realized i hadn t taken a bit of my food because i should  inaudible  what she was working on  it was so amazing  i was incredibly engrossed  i couldn t stop talking a word about it  ultimately, i became a partner in her business and yet i saw   she went and told her story to other investors  i really do think they judged her by the cover and didn t take her seriously as one of the most aggressive, ambitious, savvy, successful entrepreneurs i ve ever worked with  inventure will be a huge company and a big thanks to shivani, who not only founder herself but taught herself to code and yet i was as guilty as anybody  i really think initially i was judging the book by the cover, and i wouldn t have given at the time of day unless we d been or sat next to each other  i encourage everyone to keep building diversity and inclusion programs to keep putting time into these efforts and talking about the subject as it s glaring and the extent to which we re seeing these communities underrepresented  frankly, this makes for more boring and starched environment  i love going to inventure for the board meetings and you can see if you go to inventure, i n v e n t u r e, and look at their about page and who works at the company, you ll see it s the most ethnically diverse company maybe in our entire industry  i have the most fun when i go to their offices  i think it s the most collegial and exciting, and happy place i ve ever been to  i think it correlates, and so when you ve got just a bunch of white guys all hang out with each other, i don t think this is fun  i don t think this is rewarding  hopefully, this will continue to get better, but i would just want to acknowledge the fact that i think greed will play a role in helping straighten that up  where can i get some of those sweet shirts? scully is my brand  i buy them direct from the company now  they send them to me, but vintagewesternwear com is a good place to go look for all of them   if working in a startup environment, what should one do or focus on to learn and improve as much as possible?  i think you should go to all the meetings you can even though if you re not invited to, and figure out how to be helpful  if people wonder why you re there, just start taking notes  read all the other notes you can find in the company and gain a general s knowledge that your very limited job function may not offer you one day, and just make yourself useful and helpful by doing so  that s worked for me in a few different environments and i encourage you to try it   chris, what s next for you down the road a bit? will you grow bored with the current vc path? will it fascinate for decades?  what would you be doing if you decide to stop investing? it s not about getting bored  solving problems and competing to make things better is always fun  if you don t agree with that, this is definitely not the business for you  you should go check on that, but copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved       instead the current vc path, for me, it can be frustrating  one of the hardest things as an investor is having so much time, energy, money, passion, and even identity wrapped up in a company that you don t actually run  it s exhausting to not be able to make those decisions and yet to have so much at stake  plus as these companies get bigger and bigger, yes, it means bigger dollars, more money potentially to be made but it also means bigger egos, more politics, more pissing matches or backstabbing, i realized all of the fears gone  i realized the cost that was   what she was coming for me, i wasn t sleeping very well  i was gaining weight  i wasn t getting exercise  i want to hide high anxiety  i actually brought on a partner matt mazzeo  matt not only helped re energize me a bit but he was a fantastic partner and really taught me some things about investing and about the companies that we re going to be successful  a little over a year ago, matt took over our funds day to day and i became the chairman of lowercase, so i actually have a step back from the vc path, in the path that built the business  i still work on lowercase every day but matt runs our funds  in place of that, i have 3 kids now  i have an amazing wife, a brother, who i m really close to, my parents, who i m close to  i have been there to help my wife on her creative projects, just basically a support role on these incredible scratch   sniff guide to whiskey books she s written  we ve worked with partners on restaurants, nonprofit work  i ve tried to focus on getting back in shape  i was hampered by a shoulder reconstruction i just had to do  let me know, by the way, if you know any diet gurus with a favorite nutritional regime  i don t know  i m out there looking for somebody  at the end of the day, trying to be away from startups is an exercise of utility i think for me  that leads me to shark tank  this season, i m on shark tank for few episodes and a lot of people ask me why someone who step back from the day to day of my firm and i think what i realize is that shark tank brought me back to what made me passionate about startups in the first place  it brought me back to a few founders with a great idea, with a product in hand, with early traction, and they want somebody to come on board and help them  that s something that really  inaudible  of who i think i am  i get excited by those ideas  i get excited by that early traction and trying to parse which ones are going to work, which ones aren t  i m thrilled by the opportunity to be helpful and have a steak in the upside when it all works out  i love putting my money where my mouth is and i love sticking my own brand, and energy, and reputation on these projects  the stage of companies that come to shark tank are they re raw, they re edgy, they re so early still  it just reminds me about the very first days of angel investing where we would sit down at a coffee at brook house caf  in  inaudible  san francisco  i would just get so thrilled and i missed that  over the years, as the business got bigger and bigger, and they re more and more lawyers involved, more and more, accountants and tax people and regulators and filings, back office folks  i just started to lose touch with what was exciting about this business  that s one of the reasons why i m absolutely thrilled to be on the show right now  i think you ll get more and more of that energy from me as the show goes on, as the season goes on  anyway, thank you, everybody, for having me back  it s always fun to talk about tim copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved       ferriss behind his back  let s keep this going out on the web more than anyone else on the internet, i love you, guys and gals, as a tribe  you re insane  tim and i talk about this a lot  you are savvy, curious  you re pragmatic  you re cheap as hell  you re ambitious, motivated  you re highly engaged and yet you re not as crazy as one might thing you d be on paper  a lot of people i think would jump to the conclusion that tim s devotees must be all crackpots  a few of you definitely are, but most of you are just really amazing people  i enjoy hearing from you  i m  on twitter,  on periscope, and csacca on snapchat  last, let me just say, i m on shark tank this friday, the 15th of january, 9 p m  eastern and pacific and i ve got something to say during those time slots on your calendar and schedule a vitally important meeting with me  do it at my email address csacca, c s ac c a,  i ll accept your meeting and we can have a one on one particularly if you give it a name that makes it sound like the faith of the world is riding on it  a few hundred people have done this already and are getting the kick out of it, so give it a try  this friday, shark tank at 9  let s watch together  i m sure i ll be on periscope and we can live watch it together  all right, everyone, thank you so much  this has been fun   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved       "
49,50,50: Peter Attia ,"show notes and links at tim blog podcast tim ferris   mr  peter, tell me about your very, very boring and repetitive breakfast   peter attia   it usually starts with nothing, and then i usually do a second course usually because i m a little hungry and i ll have a little bit more nothing  i usually top it off with a bit of nothing   sponsor ads   tim ferris   this is tim ferris, and welcome to another episode of the tim ferris show, special holiday edition  i am celebrating this december with some reflection looking back at what i ve done this year or not done and reassessing  trying to figure out how to do things that are bigger, better, badder in the coming year  and one of the most impressive people that i m contemplating, thinking of emulating, in this coming year is peter attia, md  he is the guest for this episode  and while i sip on my guayusa tea, which is from the amazon, maybe a shrub tree   i have no idea   but it s something that s going to get you stopped in customs and perhaps have your body cavities searched if it s in a big gallon, zip lock bag  don t ask me how i know that  he is one of the few people i have on speed dial for advice, and peter s a very impressive guy  he is the president and cofounder of the nutrition science initiative, nusi, which can be thought of as the manhattan project for nutrition  i m and advisor to that group  he cofounded it with gary taubes who wrote  good calories, bad calories   but prior to all of that, he has an incredible range of experience  he worked at mckinsey   company  before that he spent five years at johns hopkins hospital as a general surgery resident, where he was the recipient of many different prestigious awards, and he also authored comprehensive reviews of general surgery  he spent two years at the nih, the national institutes of health, as a surgical oncology fellow at the national cancer institute, and he earned many different degrees  i m not going to go into all of them, but md from stanford, mechanical engineering and applied mathematics degrees   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    the guy s a stud, and he is also an ultra endurance athlete  so he puts theories into practice  he also does horrible, horrible things to himself in the name of self experimentation   just like me   that we will get into in this interview  so without further ado and it does get a little into the weeds   it gets a little dense in a few areas   and i m for you to just bear with it  there are lots of gems here, so please meet peter attia  tim ferris   peter, welcome to the show  thank you for joining me on this afternoon   peter attia   thanks for having me, tim   tim ferris   i have thought about our original introduction  i think it had to be through gary taubes  is that right? was that the first contact?  peter attia   yeah, i think gary introduced us about two and a half years ago   tim ferris   to give people a little bit of context because there are many things i d love to delve into, not the least of which is your medical and scientific pedigree, but also your similar dna  that is, i feel like we re cut from the same cloth that we have a certain lack of selfpreservation in self experimentation or at least interest in pushing things to kind of or very clearly obsessive degree  so i want to jump into both of those, but the project that first brought us together was nusi  so maybe you could give people just a little bit of background on what nusi is  of course, i ended up becoming and advisor, but the manhattan project for nutrition as it has been called maybe you can tell people a little bit about it   peter attia   yeah, it s exactly how we got introduced, tim  it s basically an organization that gary and i founded in 2012 with the idea of trying to do nutrition science at a level that currently isn t doable in the existing funding and political is the wrong word but sort of risk atmosphere of how nutrition science is done  so fundamentally we argue that   and i don t think you ll find much push back on this there are two main impediments do doing exceptional work in nutrition science  the first is that while in aggregate there s a lot of money out there in terms of doling it out to specific studies, it s shockingly low, and secondly and perhaps more importantly there really isn t an appetite to ask questions that are directly counter to the conventional point of view   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and so we felt that there are in fact alternative hypothesis about the role of diet and disease that do need to be asked  they could be wrong  it s entirely likely or certainly plausible that these ideas that we have could be incorrect, but they deserve a shot  they re certainly not our ideas, right  i mean, we re just sort of champions of them  and if the worst thing that happens is you spend time and resources demonstrating that what s currently believed to be true is true, that s a pretty limited downside when you consider that the upside is if you demonstrate the opposite that some of these things in fact are incorrect, the payoff s enormous  tim ferris   right  i think that oftentimes perhaps people view being a scientist as something that is restricted to a very rarified echelon of highly trained people  and, granted, there are who are very well trained for science, but it s really on some level about finding hypotheses worth disproving and sort of asking the uncomfortable questions  so i think political is an appropriate term in a lot of instances, and to frame it a different way, the reason i was attracted to nusi is that many of the studies out there are either very poorly designed  they conflate correlation with causation  you see this all the time  they re misinterpreted by media, and then they re oftentimes funded by very, very biased parties who sometimes have a profit motive  so the idea that you could raise whatever the dollar amount was but you had your anchor backer was the arnold family, if i m not mistaken   peter attia   that s correct, john and laura arnold   tim ferris   i suppose his background is as an energy trader, i believe, but please correct me if i m wrong   peter attia   that s correct   tim ferris   you have this money coming in that is independent, unbiased, to fuel studies designed and conducted by an eclectic collection of the brightest scientists in the us and probably beyond, many of whom disagree with one another  maybe you can just comment on that because i think it s a really important point   peter attia   yeah, when gary and i started talking about this idea back in probably the spring to summer of 2011, we realized that we actually both had a pretty similar point of view on what the likely dietary triggers of metabolic disease were  in other words, why is it  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    that in one generation or certainly two generations we ve seen an epidemic of disease that previously didn t really exist? we also agreed that the current state of the evidence   that which we found most compelling   was technically not really sufficient enough to change the rules of the game, to change the way medical advocacy groups and physicians and even the government would suggest people go about eating  so we thought that what was missing was science, but to your point to get a whole bunch of people that agree with you that share your point of view to do the work is not a powerful way to go about doing it  part of the opportunity here is working with people who have different points of view about things  not just because that s allowing you to draw from a broader pool, you re now actually access everybody as opposed to a subset, but because a really good scientist at the end of the day is defined by several things  but one of them is when confronted with conflicting data, they face it as opposed to sort of coming up with what we call ad hoc hypotheses, which are bolt on hypothesis meant to support the original hypotheses in the face of evidence contrary  tim ferris   i want to give people perhaps a snapshot on your background because i think science can be intimidating, but ultimately if you look at a lot of the, say, amateur scientists throughout history, oftentimes the motives were very personal  so they lived in a place where smallpox was an epidemic, and they noticed that milkmaids didn t get smallpox  and they hypothesized they could take sort puss or whatever from cows and inject their own families   i mean, these crazy fucking ideas that ended up having a high degree of validity  you earned your md from stanford  you have a mechanical engineering in applied mathematics degree from queens university, and you have mckinsey  you have john hopkins hospital as a surgery resident, lots of awards and so on but   and we can dig into that a little further   what are your obsessions from a performance standpoint? and i was half joking earlier when i said lack of self preservation, but it is kind of literal in the sense that it s possible to try to optimize health to the point where it s in your best interest to just kind of sit in a metal box and absolve yourself of interacting with anything in life   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and i think that you maximize your performance at the same time  so what are some of your obsessions in that realm at the moment or interests? peter attia   well, growing up, tim you know i grew up in canada  so, obviously, hockey was sort of the most important sport of any good canadian kid growing up, but actually pretty early on around the age of 13 my interest actually shifted towards boxing and marital arts  and that became really the focus of my life, and i never really did it in moderation  so even in high school i was sort of training six hours a day very, very hard  even though in amateur boxing it s only three rounds, i was always thinking about the next step, which was being a professional  and, of course, at the time that s 12 rounds of boxing, so everything i did was geared towards  i had to run ten to fifteen miles in the morning not just four  i had to jump rope for 30 minutes not just 15 and had to spend this many hours sparring each day  and so my foray into my care about the body s performance always came through the lens of performance  so it was how does the way i train or how does the way i eat impact my performance initially in a boxing ring? now, at the time it was highly crude  in fact, i suffered from the issue that i m sure a lot of 14 year old boys suffered from, which we d all kill to have that problem again, which is actually couldn t gain weight  i started my career at 127 pounds  by the time i was 16, i was a solid middle weight, which is 160 pounds  but as you may know from your experience, most people lived ten pounds above their weight class and then come down to it  but i was only four percent body fat, so i actually lived and fought at about 158 pounds  and to keep that weight on, i would eat about 6 to 7 thousand calories a day  just to give you an example of lunch because it was the one meal i can really remember, it was an entire loaf of bread, which is 15 pieces of bread  so that was seven sandwiches with a two liter jug of orange juice, and then at the cafeteria i would buy a plate of french fries and like some other nastiness  and like that was lunch every day in high school, and yet i had a 27 inch waist and no fat on me  in part not just because i was exercising six hours a day, i think more importantly because we re very metabolically different when we re 14 year old boys than when we re 40 year old boys  so if you fast forward i don t know how many years, athletic stuff has always been important to me  the sport has shifted  by the time i was in my early 20s, the obsession switched away from boxing into other things, and more recently in me 30s the  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    obsession became swimming   swimming     ultra,  ultra long  distance  tim ferris   how long is ultra long distance swimming?  peter attia   yeah, it s kind of a fuzzy definition  i think most people define ultra long as anything over 16 miles, but i think that s somewhat arbitrary  it s sort of like one of those things like you know it when you see it  like, is this one mile river swim     crosstalk  tim ferris   it s pornography   peter attia   yeah, exactly, right? is this one mile swim across the river ultralong? not really  is that 25 mile swim long? yeah, that s ultralong   tim ferris   what s the longest swim that you ve done?  peter attia   about 25 miles   tim ferris   that is a long swim   peter attia   so in my 30s   and this is now a different chapter in my life obviously i m not in school  i think at the time i m working at mckinsey   company in san francisco  i m still managing to spend an average of four hours   three to four hours   every day swimming because it s not linear  i spend eight hours a day on the weekends and then maybe only an hour and a half to two hours a day monday through friday, but i m obviously burning a lot of matches  and yet interestingly, my weight is getting higher and higher and higher  and i went from sort of being 170 pounds to 205 pounds, and the composition of that weight wasn t what i wanted  it wasn t like i was gaining all this muscle  i was gaining fat, and the blood tests showed that i was basically pre diabetic  so all of the sudden the dietary strategy     crosstalk  tim ferris   what are the indicators that you looked at?  peter attia   you do something called an oral glucose tolerance test, which they draw your blood and then you drink this horrible, nasty drink of glucose  and then they measure your insulin and glucose levels an hour later and then again two hours later coupled with other  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    standard blood tests like your triglycerides and something called a hemoglobin a1c, which measures the amount of blood sugar that s basically sticking to your red blood cells  tim ferris   is it fair to say hemoglobin a1c is sort of a running three month average of your fasting glucose, or is that completely scientifically off?  peter attia   no, it s actually pretty close  it s not fasting  it s basically a three month running average of your aggregate glucose level   tim ferris   aggregate glucose, got it  okay, cool, not to interrupt   peter attia   yeah, so anyway, basically, all of these tests were pointing in the wrong direction  i had something called metabolic syndrome, and, again, i think there s a lot of people that find themselves in that situation  to your question about what s the personal motivation, i think what pissed me off was   and i remember saying this to my wife   i said,  you know what pisses me off is i m working too hard to be in this situation   it s one thing if you re sitting on the couch eating doritos all day long, but my diet was actually much cleaner as a 35 year old than that french fry, sandwich eating kid in high school  obviously, it still wasn t the right diet, but the point is i was busting my ass to be fit and healthy and watch what i eat  and, you know, frankly i just got aggravated beyond words  we joke about it now, but at the time i literally said to my wife,  i m going to go get a gastric bypass   and she was like,  you are the most ridiculous human being that s ever lived  we re going to literally have to talk about our marriage if that s what you re considering at the weight of 205 pounds   i actually did go and see the top bariatrician in the city of san diego, and it s kind of weird story because even though i was like obviously overweight, i was the thinnest person in the waiting room by a long shot, right  and it sort of put in perspective, like,  peter, you think you ve got problems  i mean, these people each weigh 400 pounds   and when i went up when it was my turn to go and see the doctor, the nurse took me up to the scale and weighed me  we got on the scale, and i m like 210  and she s like,  ah, this is fantastic  like, are you here for a follow up?  i m like,  no, i m here for,  and so it was a real eye opening experience, tim, because frankly throughout my entire medical training, which was in surgery and then again in surgical oncology, which is cancer surgery, i had never paid attention to this problem  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved      never  if it didn t have to do with cancer, if it didn t have to do hepatobiliary surgery, i didn t care  tim ferris   orthorexia is used as a derogatory term, but i think you re very meticulous in your own testing  and perhaps even separate from nusi, but you ve introduced me to quite a few interesting tools or concepts, for instance, the idea of synthetic ketones  and maybe you could just comment on that as a taster for people, although taste might not be the way to put it  you can explain that, but this was an eye opener for me  and i remember hanging out with you having dinner not too long ago where you specked out sort of the chemical structure of beta hydroxybutyrate and a number of other ketone   i guess they d be salts   right?  peter attia   they re actually salts or esters   tim ferris   or esters, right  but what are synthetic ketones, and why might people care about them?  peter attia   well, i think that to explain it i probably have to spend a minute explaining what ketones are biologically or what we call endogenous ketones  so if you think back to what our ancestors were doing up until a few hundred years ago or certainly a few thousand years ago, we were basically often going 24 hours or longer without food  that was just the nature of how things worked, right  when you re in the hunter gatherer mindset, that s your life  the human body has only really evolved to store a finite amount of glucose, and there s only two places we store glucose  one is in the liver  one is in the muscles  and it s only that stash in the liver that s accessible by the brain because the glucose that gets stored in the muscle can t leave the muscle  it circulates within the muscle  so we this organ   the brain   which weights maybe two percent of our overall bodyweight but probably accounts for 20 percent of our body s metabolic demand, and on top of that it ordinarily functions exclusively on glucose  and so you have this problem, which is you have an organism that is wildly dependent on glucose, and we can only store a fraction of what we need  we can only store about one day s worth   tim ferris   about 400 grams, like 1600 calories?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    peter attia   it really depends on the size of the person, but, yeah, that s probably about right for average  and remember most of that, by the way, it not accessible to the whole body   tim ferris   right   peter attia   so the trick that we evolved was rather than make glucose out of protein, which is a pretty easy thing to do, the problem with that is if you want to make glucose out of protein you have to break down muscle  and the last thing you want to do when you re out there trying to find your next meal is lose muscle at the expense of getting glucose for your brain  so what if there was a way we could get the brain to use fat, right? that s the problem that needed to be solved, and the solution was a beautiful one, which is we can break down fat of which even the leanest hunter gatherer had days and days if not months of fat on their body  what if you could break that fat down in the liver into another type of molecule distinct from glucose that the brain specifically could actually utilize as fuel  and that s where ketones enter, and so what our bodies do when prolonged fasting occurs   and by prolonged i really mean it even begins at 24 hours of fasting   is we start breaking down our own sources of fat  we start making this thing you referred to beta hydroxybutyrate  not to get too geeky on it, but beta hydroxybutyrate and another member of that family called acetoacetate, they exist in an equilibrium  and these things get shuttled into the kreb cycle, which i think your readers will be familiar with, and it basically becomes another substrate for making atp  and george cahill who is sort of a luminary in this field   passed away a few years ago   but george cahill is one of the sort of leading godfathers in metabolism at harvard university  he did some legendary experiments in the  50s and  60s where they had subjects that they would starve seven to 14 days and just measure glucose levels and ketone levels  and you d think that after 14 days of not eating a person would be mentally foggy, not well, and it turned out it was just the opposite  after a couple day lull, and you know this personally tim because you ve done these long fasts, after a couple days of hell it s actually the reverse  you short of get sharp   tim ferris   you feel amazing   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    peter attia   yeah, you feel unbelievable  and what cahill showed was what fraction of the brain s energy was coming from those ketones  so that s relevant  that s starving, but look  outside of the odd,  let s do a one week a year fast,  sort of thing, how does that play into something beyond that? well, the other way you achieve ketosis though not to the same extreme is through something called nutritional ketosis, which is restricting the one dietary component primarily that restricts ketone formation and keeping at a minimum the other one that also restricts it  and those are carbohydrates and proteins respectively  and so if you eat a diet that has very little carbohydrate in it and only a modest amount of protein and the rest of it of course made up from fat, you can also generate ketones  now to your question, it turns out that you can drink or consume in some fashion   but they re all typically liquid   you can drink these ketone molecules directly  and that s what we call these exogenous or supplemental ketones, and they come in multiple different forms  they basically exist as a beta hydroxybutyrate ester, a beta hydroxybutyrate salt, and an acetoacetate diester  and i ve tried all of these things, and i can say safely say    tim ferris   why don t tell people? why don t you recount your first experience consuming these?  peter attia   yes, so the first one i tried was the beta hydroxybutyrate ester, which a very good friend of mine sent me, and i had been told these things taste horrible  i had talked to two people who had consumed them before, and these are stoic dudes  like, this isn t like a six year old kid  this is like stoic, military dudes who said,  oh, man, that s the worst tasting stuff on earth   and so i knew that, but i think that piece of information was sort of like fleeting in the excitement when the box came  and so i tear open the box, and also there was a note in there that explained a somewhat palatable cocktail that you could mix   like how you could mix this with ten other things  and i just disregarded that, and i just took out like the 50 ml flask  and i chugged it, and i remember it was like 6 00 in the morning because my wife was still sleeping  and all these thoughts go through your mind  so first all, you drink it, and it tasted like how i imagine jet fuel or diesel would taste  if you ve ever smelled distillate, it s this horrible odor, and you can sort of imagine what it would taste like  this is what it tasted like, and so my first thought was,  god damn, like, what if i go blind? what if there s  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    like methanol in here? like, what did i just do?  and then my next thought was just,  oh my god, you re gagging  i mean, you re really gagging  if you puke this stuff up, you re gonna have to lick up your puke and this stuff  it s just gonna be a disaster   and so i m like retching and gagging and like trying not to wake up the family and trying not to like spew my ketone esters all over the kitchen  and it took like 20 minutes for me to get out and do my bike ride, which was the whole purpose of that experiment  tim ferris   must have been a record setter   peter attia   oh, god, those things are unbearable  so until they figure out a way    tim ferris   no, just to put that in perspective  i m speculating here, but correct me if i m wrong  i would imagine much like myself you ve made a somewhat secondary career of choking down foul tasting shit, like gels on ryes or like all these protein powders, like the most hideous, ostensibly performance enhancing sports supplements  you get to a point where you re like,  i ve had bad stuff  how bad could it really be?   peter attia   yeah, i m a generally insensitive person to bad taste  this took it to another level, and the funny thing is i m such a glutton for punishment  i had the guy send me like half a liter of it after because i was determined to make it work  like, i got to figure it out, and i would like try mixing it with this and mixing it with that  and also i wanted people to try it with me  any time i had a friend over, i d make him dip his pinkie in to at least try like a sliver of it  and even some of the most stoic people i know were like,  wow, you couldn t design something to taste that bad   so the good news is the acetoacetate diester actually can be put into a capsule  so if you re willing to take 20 capsules in one sitting   each one the size of a horse pill   you can trade one problem for another  so you get rid of the taste, but then you have to gag down 20 capsules, which also tends to induce the desire to vomit  so i went down that path for a while and then really settled in on the beta hydroxybutyrate salts  to this day though i don t use them that often because they re pretty expensive and we re not at a point in time yet where we have a great like supply of them   tim ferris   what are the potential benefits or advantages of consuming these synthetic ketones?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    peter attia   well, the benefit that interested me the most, which came out of the research done by a guy named richard veech at nih    tim ferris   how do you spell veech?  peter attia   v e e c h  now it turns out, you may remember a moment ago i mentioned george cahill at harvard who is like a god, i never met george cahill, but i ve met richard veech  and richard veech actually did his post doc with cahill, so he came from that sort of lineage of uber smart folks  and veech showed in animal models that when you switched the substrate from glucose or even fatty acid to ketones you could generate more atp   more mechanical work   for less oxygen  the difference was enormous in the animal models   tim ferris   i also saw some unpublished data that looked at this in athletes human athletes that is   and it suggested that there was a difference  so one of the things i wanted to do is do an experiment, which was, look, for a certain athletic event there may be an advantage to being able to consume less oxygen for a fixed power output  and that may not be true for all athletic events  would that benefit a basketball player or a tennis player where you re stopping and starting and it s more explosive? i m not sure, but i think it would address someone doing a long, steady state subthreshold effort  now subthreshold you mean below their anaerobic threshold   peter attia   correct  below ventilatory and anaerobic threshold  so when we do marathon stuff, we refer to all day pace, which is typically about 65 percent of your vo2 max is a space that once you get really well tuned, you can probably hold that pace for 10 to 12 hours   tim ferris   got it  persistence hunter speed   peter attia   yeah   tim ferris   got it  cool  now ketosis is a really fascinating state, and we don t have to delve too far  well, maybe to address a common point of confusion, people sometimes fear ketosis thinking of it as ketoacidosis, as observed in some people, diabetes  they re not the same thing as i understand it   peter attia   that s correct  they re related in the way that a house fire and a fireplace are related  so when a house is on fire, there s fire  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    everywhere, and when you have a fireplace on, there s fire in there  so they have an association, but that s where it ends  whereas in the fire place is like a well controlled thing that actually adds some value, whether it be light or heat, the house fire is obviously not a controlled thing  and therefore it s not a positive thing  it s a destructive thing  so ketoacidosis is indeed a very destructive phenomenon, and it is a situation that rises almost exclusively in people with type 1 diabetes  now i ve read some really interesting case reports of people who are not type 1 diabetic who have had ketoacidosis, but these examples of that are so rare that i think it s almost confusing to talk about them  so for the purpose of most people, ketoacidosis is a state that occurs usually when someone with type 1 diabetes gets sick  there s usually a precipitating event, and what basically happens is a deficiency of insulin because a type 1 diabetic requires exogenous insulin  they have to be injecting themselves with insulin  so you have a miss match between the need for insulin and glucose  and what s basically happening is in the absence of insulin, which actually suppresses ketones, their ketone levels rise  and once the ketones get kind of north of 15, 1 5 millimolars, and certainly any higher   20 to 25 millimolars   you basically get into an acid based problem where the ph now starts to drop  so you get what s called metabolic acidosis in response to that  i feel like i must have taken care of 100 people with ketoacidosis when i was back in the emergency room  it s a life threatening illness, but the good news it s a very simple treatment  you give them massive amounts of iv fluid, glucose, insulin, potassium, and they re usually better within two days  now ketosis, totally different  someone who has a normal working pancreas can t really generate ketones north of   i ve heard of the odd person who can get up to 9 or 10 millimolars   but for most people even if they starved themselves for two weeks and certainly in cahill s subjects over gosh, i think his highest   40 days in the longest cahill cohort, they plateau at 6 millimolars  which is still a very high level, but it s nowhere near the level that produces acidosis  and that s because there s an auto regulatory feedback from insulin  tim ferris   i plateaued personally about six 6 millimolars when i was doing my seven day fast  so just to add something to what you said, for  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    those people listening if you go on the internet and you re researching ketosis and you see someone say,  ketosis is very dangerous,  and they link to an article, make sure that they are referring to nutritional ketosis not ketoacidosis  it s very commonly mixed up  the other tip i wanted to offer people who may not be very familiar with scientific terminology is a good pneumonic for remembering the difference between exogenous and endogenous is thinking of an exoskeleton on an insect, where their skeleton is on the outside  so  exo  typically means administered from the outside  you re not producing it in your own body, so endogenous versus exogenous  i was hoping peter that you could describe for people listening an experiment that you did which highlights your wonderful obsession and the metabolic chambers  and i thought if you wouldn t mind just briefly describing sort of the standardized experimentation that you did in the metabolic chambers  most people don t even know probably what these chambers are or what they re used for, but i d love to hear you describe that if you wouldn t mind  peter attia   so i guess going back to nusi, one of the types of experiments that gary and i felt were really essential to be funded were the types of experiments that examined what we think is perhaps one of the most important questions in all obesity, which is,  is obesity simply a disorder where people consume too many calories, or does the type of calorie they consume play just as much a role?  in other words, there s no dispute that someone who s gaining weight is eating more calories than they re expending  and we have the first law of thermodynamics to thank for that wonderful fact  it s just not particularly interesting  it s sort of like saying,  hey, tim, do you know why bill gates is so rich? he s so rich because he makes more money than he spends   like, thanks, right?  tim ferris   biography complete, right   peter attia   i m peter greggs  thanks for watching biography  so it really irks me when we talk about obesity through the lens of it s an eating disorder  people eat more than they expend  like, yeah, no shit, sherlock  what i really want to know is why do they eat more than they expend  what is it that s driving that? and so one of the hypothesis is the types of calories we consume could actually be feeding back on the two systems that regulate what we eat and  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    what we expend being your appetite  in other words, are there some foods that make you want to eat more? and secondly your   what we call   non deliberate energy expenditure, meaning how much energy do you expend? so to your question about the chambers   tim ferris   is that the same as resting metabolic rate?  peter attia   yeah, there s a little bit of confusion between all of the restings and basal metabolic rates, but i think the easiest way to describe it   that s why i use the term non deliberate energy expenditure   it s sort of like, okay, you can go out for a run and burn 500 calories  and you can climb a flight of stairs and burn four calories, but what i really care about is   and what we know from studying people for forever is   the majority of the calories that the average person is burning is the calories they re burning when they re doing nothing  it s when you re sleeping, when you re sitting down, and so we measure that in a way  and we can also measure the total energy expenditure  so the question is can a question in macronutrient composition alter your appetite and your energy expenditure? now, measuring appetite, we can talk about that  we could spend two hours just talking about how you measure appetite and appetitive behavior  we ll save that for another day  on the energy expenditure side, there s really two ways to measure energy expenditure   tim ferris   sorry to interrupt, peter  just for those people who may not be deep in the nutritional world, so macronutrients   and, again, feel free to correct me, peter, at any point   but you re talking about the distinction between protein, carbohydrate and fat principally  is that correct?  peter attia   correct  that s correct  i m glad you brought that up  the reason we re asking that question is not because we think that that s the perfect vision amongst nutrients  i mean, there s a million different ways to distinguish between a piece of broccoli and a piece of bread, and even the macronutrient composition isn t the best one there  but what we re really interested in is that we have a pretty good understanding of how macro nutrients impact hormones and enzymes in the body and how those enzymes may regulate fat cell accumulation   the accumulation of fat within fat cells, adipose sites   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    so this business of measuring energy expenditure is really tricky  and the two ways to do it, i ve participated in both of those  one is a measure using doubly labeled water, and another one is a technique called indirect calorimetry  so anybody who s had a vo2 max test has actually done indirect calorimetry  so if they ve been on that treadmill or on the rowing machine or whatever, they ve got that mask on them  it s actually sampling the amount of oxygen that they re using and the amount of co2 that they re generating  and some of your listeners may know that there s a ratio between those two  so the ratio of the co2 that you expend, which is called vc02   the ventilatory co2   over the ratio of oxygen consumed is called rq   respiratory quotient, and there s a mathematical relationship that ties all of those into the amount of energy you re consuming  so that s why when somebody does a treadmill test with one of those masks, we can tell two really exciting things about them  one is how much energy they use for that given task and, perhaps as interestingly if not more interestingly, where they got that energy from  did they break down glucose, or did they use fat? so what if you want to do this for a long period of time, and you don t want to stick a mask on somebody? so then what you do is they build these rooms, these super duper, nasa, airtight rooms with double layered, gas sealed doors and window and everything  and the room has thousands of air sensors in it that sample frequently   generally about every 15 seconds   the concentration of co2 and o2 in the room, and they then calculate on a minute by minute or second by second basis how much oxygen you re consuming as the subject in that room and how much co2 you re producing  and you ll typically spend 24 hours to 48 hours at a time in these lockdown rooms  of course, they re handing food to you through a doubly sealed door so even during the transfer of food or body fluids you re not contaminating the air in the room  and there s an engineering corps outside the room that s just getting all this data, and when the day is done, you can tell exactly how many calories you burned that day and where you got that energy from  did you burn fat stores or glucose stores? tim ferris   you repeated an experiment in a number of these chambers, and you standardized the experiment where you were consuming exactly the same meals, performing exactly the same exercise routines  what were some interesting results or unusual data that came out of those experiments?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    peter attia   well, first of all, the reason i wanted to do this was because one of the first studies that nusi funded was relying on these sorts of chambers across the country and so at four different sites actually  there aren t many of these things  i think there s only like maybe 15, 16 of these chambers in the united states  i mean, they re very expensive  it s a pretty costly piece of equipment  what we were basically asking subjects to go through because in these experiments we were asking subjects to spend two days a week inside a chamber for several months  so i wanted to at least get a sense of what that would feel like  i mean, does that drive you crazy? what s that like? the second thing i wanted to get a sense of was, as you alluded to, how reproducible are the results from once center to another   from one site to a site? and then of course there s just always this sort of morbid curiosity of what will we learn? i m curious as to how these things change  i have no idea how much energy i expend in a day, nor do i have an understanding of how much of that is basal versus activity related  and so i did this across three separate stints, and you were absolutely correct  so it was an exact, finite meal  now i realized after the first day we did, we underdid the meal  in an ideal world, you match your intake to your expenditure  so a priori we had designed what the experiment was going to look like to try to replicate my life outside of a chamber  so down to the minute we knew everything that was going to happen  so i was going to go to sleep at this hour  i was going to wake up at this hour  i was going to do this  i was going to get on the bike   the stationary bike   and ride it this many watts because it had a power meter  i was going to do this many pushups, this many plyometrics, this many sit ups, eat the meal at this time, work on the computer for this time  so we did it the exact same way each time  and after the first day it was clear that we had only given me 3,000 calories, but my energy expenditure was about 4,300 or 4,400 kilocalories  so i had a 1,400 calorie deficit, and, of course, i wanted to fix that the next time  but i was like, you know what? i d rather we just stay reproducible and do it  so one of the things that i found interesting was how high my metabolic rate was at rest  so to do this in a chamber, you basically spend two hours wide awake doing nothing, laying down  and that produces a slightly higher metabolic rate than when you re sleeping, but it s the closest thing we have to a true resting energy expenditure   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferris   are you reading, or are you just staring at the ceiling for two hours?  peter attia   no, no  if drinking those ketones was the worst thing i ve ever done and then almost dying getting an insulin suppression test was the second worst thing i ve ever done, the third worst thing i ve ever done is having to spend those two hour blocks doing nothing because you re not allowed to do anything  you can t sleep  if you even close your eyes, the dude is knocking at the door  you can t watch tv  you can t talk on the phone  you can t even check your phone if it beeps  i mean, it was really painful   tim ferris   okay, just had to ask because talk about monkey mind   peter attia   oh, yeah  no, it was crazy  so, yeah, it was interesting  it gave you a sense of how useless some of the tables are that we use to typically try to understand metabolic behavior  so if you put all of my statistics into a table   right   so  i m this tall  i weigh this much  i m this old  i m a guy  i exercise this much  i have this percent body fat  if you put all of my data into a table and i ve done this with the most elaborate regression models that exist, they all basically say my resting energy expenditure is somewhere between 1,720 and 1,760 calories per day   tim ferris   that s a pretty narrow range   peter attia   yeah, it is  yeah, yeah   tim ferris   and in fact in the chambers?  peter attia   and in fact in the chambers it turned out to be between 2,100 and 2,250 on three occasions  so i am definitely burning 400 calories a day more than anybody would predict, and i would argue similarly that i take care of patients in my medical practice in whom their metabolic rate is infinitely slower than what is predicted by those tables  and so i think tables are directionally probably reasonable, but at the end of the day, you realize that the individual variation among people is significant  and, of course, one of my questions is how much of that is macronutrient dependent?  tim ferris   right  it raises a question  you may have thought about this  you probably have thought about it before, but looking at say blood  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    ranges   the normal range for various biomarkers when you have blood tests performed, whether that be hemoglobin a1c or total cholesterol or anything else   and how those numbers change over time  and what i ve just become so fascinated by is looking at how difficult it is to find someone who is living hard   living and playing hard, whether they re an athlete or just someone who s a type a personality ceo type   who isn t constantly out of range on at least a handful of things  and the questions that i ve started to ask are if we re not able to get the nutrition we need ostensibly as reflected in these tests, how the hell did our ancient predecessors ever pull it off, number one? and does that in fact mean that they didn t, and it s a flaw in the test  or is there rather than not getting enough of something is modern man exposed to various types of contaminants or estrogenic compounds in shampoo or who the hell knows that create those deficiencies? it s not that we re not getting enough  it s that there are things that are causing deficiencies  or, again, just the tests are influenced by lobbying and all these other things, and they re just not reliable  how do you even start to think about that stuff because thankfully there are doctors i work with who can look at the tests and say,  this is slightly out of range  i wouldn t worry about it at all for these following reasons   but for people who go to a doctor once a year or get an annual checkup and get prescribed drugs for anything that s out of range just based on that one snapshot, i mean, how do you even start to think about this stuff? i know that s a long question, but it s something that s been bothering recently  peter attia   yeah, it s something i think a lot about  i became most interested in this a couple of years ago  well, to back up for a second, i have my own centrifuge and blood draw kit at home and stuff like that because i m doing blood work a lot on myself and on anyone who is unlucky enough to walk in the front door  but one of the things i noticed was just the huge variability in my lipoproteins  these are the molecules that carry around cholesterol and triglycerides in our body  conventional thinking would be, hey, if you re not taking any drugs and or your diet s not really changing much, why would those things vary? and yet i had a dental abscess i was sort of ignoring because i was too busy and it was sort of getting pretty bad, and eventually just had to get the tooth yanked out  and i noticed that the changes in my lipoproteins were enormous   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and so i started realizing, hey, obviously inflammation absent any other change is changing these things  and then i got this idea which was i wonder how much exercise is impacting it  so i did an experiment with the help of actually the lab that does all the acae because this was such an exhaustive thing  i couldn t do it on my own  so basically i did super comprehensive like ten tube blood draws on myself in three days but sandwiched around similar activities  so i would do an immediate morning fasting one  then i would do an immediate hard work out then immediately do one after and then immediately do one three hours later  and there are some things that you should expect to vary a lot due to that kind of variation  you should expect your glucose levels to change, probably your triglycerides, probably your insulin levels, right  there are other things that you d think,  wow, if they change and we re prescribing medication to people based on those such as crp, ldl cholesterol, ldl particle number, these sorts of things, we maybe need to ask ourselves a question   so sure enough the changes were amazing  i mean, i couldn t believe what a hard workout would do   how much crappier it made you look on paper  the first time i ever did this, actually, tim was in 2005 when i swam from catalina island to la  and i had my friend mark lewis, who s an anesthesiologist, draw my blood like ten minutes before i got in the water on catalina island and then ten minutes after i got out of the water in la ten and a half hours later  and it was a real epiphany for me because i had developed something called systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sirs, which is something that we typically see in hospitalized patients who have horrible infections or who have been in really bad trauma  gunshot, car accident, that sort of thing  so my platelets went from a normal level to six times normal  my white blood cell count went from normal to sort of   i don t know five times normal  all of these huge changes occurred in my blood that you wouldn t distinguish me from someone who had just been shot  and in many ways, you could argue, look, that s sort of what s swimming for 10 and a half hours is, right, and maybe the changes we re seeing are due to these things  so i guess i would say this  i ve always been hesitant to treat a patient for any snapshot, no matter how bad it looks, because i don t know  for example, i saw copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    a guy recently who on his morning cortisol level, it was like five times the normal level  so you might think, wow, this guy s got an adrenal tumor, right? but a little follow up question realized that at 3 00 that morning, a few hours before this blood draw, the water heater blew up in his house  so the normal level of morning cortisol assumes a guy sleeps through the night now that he has to de flood his house   crosstalk  tim ferris   deal with a household emergency   peter attia   exactly, right? so, again, a silly example but i do think the sort of big picture matters a little bit more than the immediate value sitting in front of you  now to your first question tim, i don t know that the values we deem normal have any bearing on what our ancestors would have looked like  i mean, i think this is a knowable question  i just don t know the answer  i do believe that there s somebody out there that could tell you because there s a handful of aboriginal populations that i think still exist in australia, for example, where we can get a pretty good idea of what our ancestors probably look like  and i would be interested to know how far outside of quote unquote normal are they   tim ferris   definitely  and it s not to say that perhaps the paleo ideal is not the target we should shoot for, but it makes me wonder, if you were in iceland and you re getting four hours of daylight for three to four months, do you really have the same vitamin d level as someone who s like equatorial? i don t know, but probably not i would guess  and does it really matter if that s your ethnic background? you know, the identification of uncontaminated indigenous populations has been of interest to me recently because of the lyme disease and the long term antibiotic use and trying to research fecal matter transplants shit swaps as they re scientifically known   and realizing how hard it is to find a population that has not been chronically administered antibiotics, whether in childhood or in adulthood  in tanzania apparently there are a handful of places where researchers are flocking, and there aren t that many   peter attia   that s really interesting  i had not thought of that   tim ferris   it s fascinating  and i was actually going to do a fecal matter transplant   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    as a side note, you can do the reverse enema, but there are people now who are also creating capsules that are frozen  i think they re typically frozen and then swallowed  the reason i decided against doing an fmt as they call them is that i spoke with a gastroenterologist who felt like if you were to create a spreadsheet of our known risks and the known potential benefits, you might decide to do a fecal matter transplant  but how many pathogens, how many different types of communicable diseases have we not identified that might be transmitted in a fecal matter transplant  and their hypothesis was probably a lot  i mean, we think we ve figured out things like hepatitis, but god knows what else is in there  so if you don t have to do it, if you re not dying of crohn s disease or who knows, if it s a total optional thing like of like you and your bariatric band, then probably not a good idea to do a fecal matter transplant  but this leads me just as it relates to the blood testing   oh, just as a side note, i m not a doctor  i don t play one on the internet, but maybe peter you could share your thoughts on this and just as a cautionary note  i ve so many friends here in the us and elsewhere who, again, they have one or two checkups a year  if anything s out of range, they re prescribed medication, and the doctor will do their best  and they re constrained by a lot of things, but they ll do their best to trend  and they ll look at previous blood tests, and what astonishes me is that the day of the week and the time of the day of the draw is not standardized  so, for instance, i have friends   male friends   who are now prescription testosterone  they ve been given supplemental testosterone because their testosterone was 200 points lower than a previous test  and if i look at their blood tests   not as a doctor just as a friend, obviously, out of curiosity   i m like,  well, wait a second  you had one test at 8 00 in the morning and another one at 11 30   and when i ve done my own   i ve done so many different blood tests there s a very clear peak that then drops off really quickly for me depending on the time of the day  and certainly like your friend with this his water heater disaster, if you do a test on say a thursday after three or four days of no drinking and then a test on monday morning after a weekend of binge drinking, your values are inevitably going to be kind of all over the place  so just the importance of standardizing time, i think, for any type of trending is really important for people to keep in mind  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    peter attia   completely agree   tim ferris   so, peter, you sent me something very interesting a couple of days ago and the email that turned into a manifesto  you sent me a 20 some page document that i do think you should turn into something about your thinking on basically hacking lifespan and performance and how to choose the appropriate blend of the two for yourself  i was hoping maybe you could comment on perhaps the common misconceptions or just sloppy thinking around life extension if we could start there   peter attia   yeah, so i don t know what, why, it occurs, but i guess once we hit our 40s where i m comfortable now and maybe it s having kids   i don t know   but something sort of changes where we become a little bit more interested in longevity than we do performance  i think my days of sort of trying to be the best at anything are long behind me  i do still compete in compete in at least one sport competitively  i do sort of at least with myself give a damn about how i do, but the reality of it is nobody actually cares  right, like, it s not like pinarello is sponsoring me, and if i don t have a good race this weekend, they re going to drop me  like, nobody cares  i don t think my wife could tell you within like 200 percent my times   tim ferris   this is for the 20 kilometer time trial?  peter attia   yeah, exactly  i mean, it s just like who cares, right? nobody cared except me  but this was all catalyzed as you said through an email that a friend sent me over the summer  so it was a good friend of mine who s probably 50 years old, super duper stud in all manners of life, very, very successful guy, does iron man, half iron man all the time  and i think he had just done sort of like his 20th half iron man or something like that  and he said,  you know, peter, i feel like i m 50 now  i don t know that i need to do these anymore  i really want to start thinking about how i should shift my exercise towards increasing my longevity as opposed to fixating on performance of an athletic event   and so i responded to that email with a very long email, and that email   thanks to evernote   turned into basically a collection of all of my thoughts on this  and that s actually what i sent you the other day because i knew if anybody would like it you would get a kick out if   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferris   loved it   peter attia   yeah, so it s really been an obsession of mine for a long period of time  i think it s just crystalized into something that s getting more deliberate focus, which is how do you balance the desire to live longer   to live more years on this earth   with the desire to enjoy them and perform well? because you can come up with all of these sort of thought experiments that are idiotic  and i include one in this piece, which is if someone said to me,  peter, you can live to be 150 years old in perfect health, but you have to sit in a dark room, alone, and never see your family again   would you do it? i mean, not a chance, right? like, i d rather die in five years than have to do that   tim ferris   there s also been some evidence in nematodes   i m not sure in mice models or anything   that show that avoiding ejaculation can extend your lifespan   similar idea   peter attia   well, we know castration can   tim ferris   oh, fantastic   peter attia   so, yeah, castration has been shown in most animal models to increase longevity   tim ferris   it solves the volitional ejaculation issue   peter attia   yeah, yeah  so there has to be a balance, right? similarly, i think there s pretty good evidence that there are certain dietary strategies that could really increase longevity, but if they come at a cost that detracts from wanting to live, they might not be worth it  so that s one macro theme  the other macro theme is we do need to distinguish between, because these are sometimes orthogonal, what i would call cellular health and what i would call organism health  so i think there are things that matter on a cellular level  there are things that can delay aging of the cells within our body, and those aren t necessarily things that produce the best output of the organism  and so i suspect that the solutions to this thing, which i have lots of thoughts on, are not going to be simple  there s going to be a few 80 20 pieces thrown in, and a little bit of bootstrapping, and a little bit of empirical feedback  i think there s gonna be some people that respond more favorably to some things  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    versus others  and i do think there s some really exciting pharmacologic plays that are out there that need further study but i think could sort of move the needle  tim ferris   so just conceptually i think people will find a number of things interesting that i ll just highlight here  one is the thinking of life extension or death avoidance  so i think death avoidance is sort of an interesting phrasing  but then also having a framework, like you said two issues, one s defensive  the other s on offensive  but delaying dying and optimizing living, right? and put another way, getting sort of 80 percent of the long term benefit while still getting   let s just argue   60 percent of the short term pleasure  i just think it s written in a very compelling way  i had a couple of very, very specific questions for you  people might find this amusing, so i ll just say it  i added a word to a line here  you have a line that is,  streamlining this a bit further, once you ve arrived into your 40s, your 50s, and assuming you re not a smoker or heavy drinker, you don t do iv drugs or engage in  dot, dot, dot   and i put you should put,  you don t do bad iv drugs,  in parenthesis since i do iv glutathione and all sorts of stuff  the question i had for you is related to igf1, and i d love for you to explain igf1 to people  but i ve talked about very openly and i ve written about for instance after reconstructive shoulder surgery i had a number of doctors supervise use of anabolic agents including testosterone or an androlone plus human growth hormone and other things  and certainly injecting exogenous growth hormone, twice a day, six days a week or whatever it might be   sort of low dose, high frequency   makes your igf1 levels much, much, much higher than they would normally be  and i m curious because it appears when we re talking about cancer that decreasing igf1 could be beneficial  what are your thoughts on the risks of growth hormone use for instance?  peter attia   yeah, so let s put this in the broader context  so as you said, there s really two pieces to longevity  the first is delaying death as long as possible  we call that the defensive plays, and then the second one is enhancing life   the offense play  on that defensive play, there are basically four diseases that are gonna kill you  in other words, if you re 40 years old and you care about this, you re probably not going to die in a car accident because you re out of that demographic  you re less likely to die of x, y and z  it turns out that when you look at the mortality tables there s an 80 percent  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    chance you re going to die from cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, cancer or neurodegenerative disease, period  and, again, i think it s really important  if you remember nothing else, remember this  if you re in your 40s or beyond and you care about this issue, which immediately puts you in a selection bias category, there s an 80 percent chance you re going to die of those four diseases  so any strategy towards increasing longevity has to be geared towards reducing the risk of those diseases as much as is humanly possible  tim ferris   not just to do a recap, so cancer, we ve got that  most people are familiar with cancer  cardiovascular disease, i think most people at a very, very high level are familiar with that  could you just briefly define cerebrovascular disease and neurodegenerative disease?  peter attia   yep, so cerebrovascular would be stroke, and there s two ways you can have a stroke  one is through an occlusion  the other one is through bleeding usually due to elevated blood pressure and things like that  and then neurodegenerative disease as its name suggests is degeneration in the brain  the most common cause of that is, in fact, alzheimer s, dementia, and alzheimer s is one of the top ten causes of death in the united states  so what do those four diseases in common? they have a lot of things in common  the most obvious is they re metabolic diseases meaning they re not infectious diseases  they don t kill you quickly  these are all disease processes that build up over time  the second thing that jumps out as us is that these are diseases that did not exist in populations that failed to see western influence  so i m not here to say that the west is bad and we ve done a bad job because i think great things have come out of everything, you know, western civilization  however, some bad things have come out of western civilization  so as it comes to my interest around diet, i think the western diet   the traditional western diet   is problematic  and i think evidence of that is that if you look at societies that haven t consumed western diets or look at the introduction of western diets to these societies you re going to see all of a sudden these metabolic diseases become the dominant sources of death  now, if you dig a little bit closer, you realize that there s a really interesting phenomenon in the anti aging literature that cropped up a long time ago, and it is still talked about just as much  and it s the idea of caloric restriction  now i m positive that you have  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    written and or spoken about this at some point, so i won t belabor the point  but the idea is that in anything from fruit flies to mice to rhesus monkeys, when you restrict calories, most of the time though not all of the time you appear to increase longevity  and you appear to increase longevity by delaying the onset of those metabolic diseases  now the million dollar question   though i have a strong point of view on this   the million dollar question is,  is that effect coming due to the reduction in a number of calories, or is it coming as a result of a reduction in a subset of the type of calorie? because if i said,  tim, we re gonna take your diet, and we re gonna reduce it by 30 percent   well, technically, i ve reduced how much fat, how much saturated fat, how much protein, how much carbohydrate, how much sugar, all these things  and so is it any one or combination of those things that have been reduced that s driving the increase in longevity? and if so could you get the same benefit without restricting calories and just restricting that agent, or is it the aggregate? now i ll tell you why i believe the answer that it s a specific set of macronutrients and not the number of calories though i could be entirely wrong because the experiment i m about to describe is highly flawed  when i say flawed, i mean it s not allowing and apples to apples comparison, so two very famous studies that were done, one at the wisconsin and one at the nih using two different strains of rhesus monkeys, so right out of the gate you ve got two separate problems with them  at the nih study they took the rhesus monkeys and they fed them a calorie restricted diet of sort of what i would call whole foods, meaning like real monkey food, like the food that they would eat in their environment  and these animals did in fact experience a slight increase in their survival  the monkeys in wisconsin were given like a laboratory made pellet of their food and obviously at lower caloric level  the problem is they hated it, and they wouldn t eat it  and the only way they could get the monkeys to eat it was to add a bunch of sugar to it  and so those monkeys went ahead on a high sugar, calorie reduced diet  it had 28 percent sucrose in it  tim ferris   oh, god   peter attia   and it turned out those animals did not experience a survival benefit  now that doesn t prove anything because these were two separate experiments  they weren t controlled  but it does suggest  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    to me that there s something about highly refined carbohydrates and sugars and potentially protein, though it might be for a different reason, that seems to raise insulin, which we know, and by extension raise insulin like growth factor  and we know that igf is driving not just aging but it s also certainly driving a lot of cancers though not all of them  so my thoughts on exogenous   again, exoskeleton   exogenous growth hormone would be i just wouldn t view it as a great thing to do other than if you had a medical need as you described, certainly recovering from an injury, things like that  i certainly know people that clinically are deficient in growth hormone and in whom it s a good thing to manage  but it certainly does concern me a little bit that i know that it s sort of the drug of choice of athletes today because it s still undetectable from a performance enhancing standpoint relative to say testosterone or sort of the typical things that athletes are getting busted for  but i personally think it s a little disconcerting that people would be pumping themselves full of growth hormone for their 20s and 30s and 40s or whatever because i do think in the susceptible individual that could be problematic  so not ubiquitously but in the susceptible person i think it could be a problem  tim ferris   just thinking about it, ironically, the people who are most inclined to use it as non athletes   i e  people who are getting older and want to improve their youthful vigor or restore some of that youthful vigor   may be the riskiest population to start administering exogenous gh because they may have sort of precancerous or cancerous   what would they be called   cancerous cells that have not yet metastasized or anything like that present already and for just like 40 or 50 years of accumulated dna damage and so on  don t know   peter attia   yeah, no  it s a super interesting clinical question because that s another very interesting population  so, for example, i ll give you an example of a population that does really well high doses of anabolic steroids and growth hormones  and that s patients with hiv wasting   tim ferris   yeah, definitely   peter attia   so you talk about a group and i ve seen these people recover  like it just blows my mind  like it s so amazing to see someone on  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    heart therapy and anabolic agents and growth hormone, and you think to yourself,  this guy has hiv? like, there s no way   so you might say,  well, look, is there an increased risk in that person s life from taking the growth hormone?  and the answer is, yeah, maybe, but compared to what? i mean, look what we re rescuing them from  so that s an obvious case  that s a no brainer  to your example tim, you know, someone who s 80 years old, maybe their greatest risk isn t cancer at that point  maybe it s a broken hip, right? maybe it s a fall, and we know this  an 80 yearold that s gonna fall and break their hip has as very significant mortality whether it be directly from a pulmonary embolism or indirectly  that s a huge risk for an 80 year old  so that s the nuance to this, right, is we can t just sort of say,  this is good  this is bad   it s gotta be,  this is context specific, and we ve got to be able to make tradeoffs   tim ferris   so speaking of context specific and different activities or interventions   whatever you want to call them   not always being 100 percent good or very seldom being 100 percent good, 100 percent bad, i wanted to chat about something that came up in this manifesto  and that is that there appears to be evidence that heavy amounts of aerobic, especially subthreshold efforts, activity, may result in right sided cardiac dilatation it looks like   stretching which may be the drive in paradoxical rise we re seeing dysrhythmia  perhaps you could just explain that for the lay audience that s listening to this but the idea that what we think is exactly what we should be doing, or that some people might think, could be doing us in fact harm  and the question i put in the margins there was,  subthreshold, what percentage max heart rate are we talking about?  because later in the piece there s a discussion of walking, which gets the greenlight  i d love to hear you expand on this a little bit   peter attia   yeah, so it s been generally sort of not acknowledged that readily, but if you actually go back and look through the literature, which i did about three months ago, i wanted to look at the literature of atrial fibrillation, which i ll explain in a second, in athletes  so why did i want to do this? because i basically started noticing every person i knew was getting a fib, so people who were older than me, my peers, patients that were coming to who were stud athletes   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    i mean, obviously, they weren t all getting atrial fibrillation, but enough of them were that i was sort of like,  what in the heck is going on here? so atrial fibrillation is a rhythm of the heart where the atrium   that s the smaller collection chambers in the top of the heart to be contrasted with the ventricles that have to do the big pumping  the atria, which only transmit blood into the ventricle, if you get beats that are generated there that are not what we would call a normal sinus beat   like there s a pacemaker within the heart that generates the normal, regular beat that you can feel if you put your hand on your wrist or your chest   an atrial fibrillation is an irregularly irregular beat  and it often gets kicked off with what we call a rapid ventricular response  so it can sometimes start being so quickly that even the ventricle picks up that beat, and all of a sudden you ve got this horrible heartrate  atrial fibrillation is a very dangerous beat the wrong patient  so it s very dangerous in people who are older or who get it for the reasons of ischemia, meaning lack of blood flow to the heart, because not only does it lead to demise directly but it can predispose you to forming clots within the chambers of the hear that then get lodged up in the brain  so older patients who are atrial fibrillation, even younger patients who are on it where they stay in atrial fibrillation long enough, are usually put on very aggressive blood thinning medication  so the question is why are all these athletes getting it, right, because it seems disproportionate? so if you look at the population as a whole and say,  how many 40 year olds have a fib?  the answer is like none  but if you look at cyclists, it s like 10 percent  if you look at runners, it s a little bit lower  so i basically started looking through all this literature  and a couple of things come up  so there s a guy by the name of james o keefe who s a cardiologist at the university  i think he s at wisconsin, and he s a great athlete himself and a cardiologist  but he s also been interested in this for a long period of time  he s got some ideas, which suggest that long amounts of sort of pretty exhausting cardiac stuff   the stuff you d experience if you were riding in an iron man or something really hard or running a marathon really hard   it actually creates a stretch in the heart  now, we know that s true  that s how we increase cardiac output  but it does so at a level that the right side of the heart can t compensate as well as the left  so the left side of the heart is very copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    muscular because it s needed to pump blood against the entire resistance of the body  the right side of the heart is actually not muscular because it only needs to pump against the lungs, which are a very low resistance system  tim ferris   which side has the higher musculature?  peter attia   left   tim ferris   left   peter attia   so the left ventricle, if you took a normal heart out of the body and did an autopsy or somebody or took a heart out of a sheep s body or something, you d see this very thick muscular left wall, and then the right one collapses  you barely see it  and, again, it s because in normal physiology one of them is pumping against like 120 millimeters of mercury  the other one s pumping against like 20 millimeters of mercury  when you exercise, when you really, really throw down the hammer, you have to increase cardiac output  meaning, how do we measure that? we measure that in liters per minute  how many liters per minute of blood are going through your body? and so if i m sitting here right now talking with you, tim, you know my cardiac output is three, four, maybe five liters per minute  when i m in a race, when i m doing an all out threshold, subthreshold effort, i m at 25 to 30 liters per minute  and i get that not just by beating faster, which gets me part of it, but by taking bigger beats each time   tim ferris   stroke volume   peter attia   and that s the stretch  you got it  that s the stroke volume  and so what o keefe has argued and certainly showed in animal models and there s a ton of epidemiology that certainly suggests it, although i don t think we re ever going to have a clinical trial that can demonstrate this one way or the other, is there s a subset of people for reasons i don t know who are susceptible where chronic, right sided dilatation over and over again leads to distortion of the right side which leads to atrial fibrillation or worse fatal dysrhythmias  we do see it  fortunately, it s quite rare, but nevertheless it s tragic where we see these athletes dying suddenly  and this is not what we typically think of as the sudden athlete death, which is actually massive left sided hypertrophy  that s a separate cause, but i think we re seeing more commonly young athletes dropping dead from  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    what looks like a heart attack only to find out their coronary arteries are pristine  tim ferris   if someone is not a professional athlete, like you said they re not gonna lose a million dollar sponsorship deal by changing their form of exercise, tentatively what would be your recommendations for perhaps things to minimize or ration a bit or things to do more of?  peter attia   well, look, this is where i m certainly the most hypocritical in all of the things i think about   tim ferris   you re doing precisely   peter attia   yeah, exactly  and i wrote about this  i m very transparent about this, right, which is right now i look at my approach to cycling as completely illogical  like, there s no upside in it, and there s just downside  and that says nothing about the risk of getting hit by a car and all the other stupid things that unfortunately happen  um, but for whatever reason, it s scratching an itch within me that is giving me so much pleasure that every year i just sort of say,  well, one more year, one more year   and i don t know  maybe i m waiting for that first bout of a fib, and them i m gonna be like,  i m done   and hopefully the a fib goes away  so i think what i d want to reiterate is, look, you got to balance your own happiness and sanity with sort of your desire to live as long as is humanly possible  and i think that if i couldn t ride my bike, i would just be very unhappy even if it gave me an extra five years of life  at some point that might not be true  that said, for people that i take care of who are like me, i don t try to talk someone out of doing this, right  what i do though, tim, is nothing breaks my heart more than seeing that person who s struggling to lose weight who thinks that they need to be running 20 miles a week  and it s like they have no desire to do it  their knees hurt  they hate it, and they re not losing weight  and i m like,  well, i ve got great news for you  you don t ever need to run another step a day in your life because there s no value in that   there is value in exercise though, and i do think that the most important type of exercise, especially in terms of bang for your buck, is going to be really high intensity, heavy strength training   tim ferris   and that s for mitochondrial density?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    peter attia   i think it s mitochondrial density  i think it s also just general glucose disposal  i also think it matters as far as aging us, meaning so many of the injuries we get as we age are kind of not just orthopedic like as in,  oh, i have neck pain or knee pain,  but a result of our inability to be strong   tim ferris   it is sarcopenia? is that the fancy way to say it?  peter attia   yeah, i mean, that s a more extreme sense, but, yeah, it s sort of like you re going out to play ball with your kid, and you get hurt doing it  it s not that you re hurt because of anything you did that you didn t have the athletic ability to do  it s been that you ve been a bit deconditioned at the muscular level  i ll give you an extreme example  if you look at the best athletes in   i don t know, pick your favorite league   the nba, the nlf, you look at them at their peak, and then you look at them when they leave  what s the difference? what s the difference between lebron james today and lebron james ten years from now? i don t think anybody disputes  in ten years he will either be retired or a fraction of what he is today  what s the difference? is it athletic skill? will he have less ball handling ability? not a chance  the difference will be strength  he will be weaker  on a strength to bodyweight ratio, he will be weaker in ten years than he is today  so i m not saying that his strength is what makes him a great athlete today  his great athleticism is due to a number of factors  but i m saying that the thing that deteriorates as we age is basically our power to weight ratio  and so i like to see people, whether they are athletes     crosstalk  tim ferris   so not absolute strength  you re talking about relative strength?  peter attia   yeah, i think it s power to weight  i don t think that we necessarily are going to increase or strength  look, i ll never be as strong as i was when i was a powerlifter in high school  i mean, at a weight of 160 i could deadlift 500 pounds and squat 425  i have no desire to do that again, right? but the point is i think i can still increase my power to weight ratio now, and i can keep there  and i can do it using muscles that are also a huge part of glucose disposal and metabolic health   tim ferris   just a quick question, a couple of quick questions, the first is do you think if you look at the careers of boxers like mohammad ali  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and there are other boxers like george foreman  now, george foreman remained strong for a very long period of time  and he was able to come back out of retirement and compete because his style didn t necessitate speed whereas you have say an ali where for any number of reasons speed seems to the first thing to go  is that a reflection of a loss of strength in some sense, or is that a loss of neurotransmitters that just give you better sort of conductivity from the brain to your periphery or other? peter attia   yeah, so it s a couple of things  ali s case is complicated because i think there s a huge appreciation in the neurology community now that dementia pugilistica, which is the brain damage that we see in boxers which is not what happened to mohammad ali  of course, he got parkinson s disease, but of course it s hard to make the case that boxing didn t accelerate that  maybe he would have always gotten parkinson s   tim ferris   tyson s another good example because his style was so predicated on speed   peter attia   yeah, so speed is power  so speed requires strength  there s no such thing as speed without strength  and it s funny because boxing s a sport i love so much  i used to  i couldn t care for the sport now, but at the time most people don t appreciate how hard ali hit  just got back and watch ali versus cleveland williams and tell me ali couldn t like knock a fire pole over  so, yeah, styles make it, absolutely  actually, foreman s a bit of an exception  usually brawlers turn to burn out first in boxing because brawlers are typically more one trick ponies  i almost attribute george foreman   remember he had two careers  after ali beat him, he then lost i think to jimmy ellis in 1977 and then retired and then like literally just went off the face of the earth and the shows up ten years later kind of reinvented  it s sort of an amazing story   tim ferris   made  120 million with the george foreman grill and came bac ka new man  it was an amazing story, yeah   peter attia   yeah, so i think you re right  i think that strength is basically everything that i describe as follows  it s firing of the transmitter in the brain  it s the neuro fire  it s the impulse down to the motor end unit, and it s the contraction  that s what i mean by strength, and i think that s the element that  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    deteriorates  now the question is   the million dollar question is why is it deteriorating and what can we do to delay the deterioration? i don t know the answer, but i believe the answer is it deteriorates due to lack of use  we basically stop training it in a way that we once did  now i think that there s something inherent that s causing the deterioration  meaning, i just think there s some aspect of aging that is slowing that down, but i think we can delay it with a specific and certain type of training that replicates the switch if you will  tim ferris   no, definitely  it brings to mind a rather embarrassing experience that i had with you where we went to the gym together, and we did a bunch of glute medius exercises  and for those who don t know what that means just imagine the side of your hip basically  i know this is vastly simplified, but imagine you re then laying on one side like a suzanne somers or jane fonda  we weren t doing exactly clamshells, but we were doing a lot of glute medius exercise  and it was agonizing  i just remember kind of rolling around on the floor  it was quite a show for everyone, but it really made me realize that as a noncompetitive athlete at this point sitting down oftentimes in chairs that are not very ergonomically set with kind of my knees splayed out or crossing my feet under a chair or whatever it might be, my glute medius had become so weak  as soon as i did literally three or four of that workout, i felt like my hip stability, my knee stability, my ankle stability, the entire sort of chain from the floor up was improved  and i felt   one could argue   younger, but it was simply from conditioning muscles that had become deconditioned from too much desk monkey work   peter attia   yeah, i mean, those are motor end units that hadn t been firing, and glute med s one of my favorites, which is why it s just a huge part of what do  but the same is true of most muscles that control lateral movement  i m all for deadlifts  i think it s probably the single best exercise you could do  if you could only limit yourself to one exercise in life, it d be a hex bar deadlift  but you gotta be a little bit careful because most sort of exercises like that are typically working muscles in a forward plane  and most athletes are actually weakest in the lateral plane, and so we ve always got to keep in mind that very strong glute med, very strong tensor fasciae latae, very strong vastus medialis, completely essential for knee hip alignment and longevity of performance   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    again, that can be like literally gardening and walking and doing the stuff that i think we most realize we want to be doing when we re in our 90s  tim ferris   so i want to ask you a couple of rapid fire questions  then i know you have to get running, and if people would like to perhaps sometime hear a round two, definitely let us know guys  i m twitter  t f e r r i s  what s your twitter handle, peter, if you have one?  peter attia   yeah,   tim ferris   that s easy  and i ll put all this in the show notes, guys, but the rapid fire questions  so the first one i want to ask is do you meditate, and if so what type of meditation do you prefer?  peter attia   oh, sorry  can i not give you a rapid fire answer?  tim ferris   okay, let me switch the order  yes, i ve planted the seed on that one  the first one is, what book have you gifted to other people the most?  peter attia   probably,  mistakes were made, but not by me    tim ferris   what is that book about?  peter attia   actually, and the other one is,  surely you're joking, mr  feynman!  those would be a tossup   tim ferris   oh, great book, great book   peter attia   so you know  surely you're joking   my son, by the way, he was born three months ago, his middle name is feynman  so he s got big boots to fill   mistakes were made, but not by me,  is a book about cognitive dissonance, and it s one of the few books that at the moment i finished it i not only reread it but i bought it for about ten people  i think that the authors, one of whom i ve become very close friends with and she is now actually an advisor to nusi as well, her name is carol tavris  one of the things the authors do such a great job of is really getting at the psychology of why it is that we are simply not wired to acknowledge mistakes when we make them, look for weaknesses in our thinking  and i just think that, you know, how do i make sure i go through life without becoming too sure of myself? because on some levels  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    i am sure of myself, but at other levels i have to realize, like, what can i do to make sure i m not missing something that could allow me to do a better job? and so i think it s a fantastic book  tim ferris   very cool  and that author s name is carol tavris, t a v r i s   peter attia   correct   tim ferris   and the other author is elliot aronson for people interested  i ll put this in the show notes as well  okay, so meditation, you don t have to give a rapid fire response  that s why it s called rapid fire questions  you could take a half hour to answer   peter attia   so when i think about the pillars of longevity, what are the things what are the levers   you have to pull to live the longest, most productive, high performing life imaginable? it involves fixing your nutrition  we ve talked about that  changing your exercise   we ve talked about that  fixing your sleep   we have not talked about that, but that s important  using the right supplements   we ve not talked about that  modulating hormones as necessary   we ve not really talked about that  fixing anything that needs to be fixed, on top of that pharmacologically, and i m a huge proponent of pharmacotherapy under the right setting  the final component is managing your stress  so as a guy who s thinking about this, i became really interested after actually reading dan harris s book, which the title is blanking on me, but it s  ten percent happier  actually is the title of the book   tim ferris   yeah, that s the one   peter attia   and i loved the book, and i read it  and i ve read a lot about mediation, but it was the first book i read where i thought, like,  i can relate to this guy   you know?  tim ferris   i think the analogy he said is when he was trying to learn to meditate it was like being dragged behind a boat trying to waterski   peter attia   so true  so to make a long story short, that made me decide it s time to get off the couch and try this stuff  and what i did is i spent about three months really working hard at what i think is the second of sort of three types of meditation that exists  so the three types being focused attention, the second being open monitoring, and the third being transcendental  and so this open monitoring or mindfulness approach, which was that which at least for dan harris turned out to be the one that worked the best for him, i  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    worked my tail off on it  and i think i got some benefit, but to be honest with you, three months in, which maybe wasn t enough and i m sure there s somebody listening to this podcast who s like a guru at it and is like,  oh my god, you re committing this common fallacy of like, blah, blah, blah,  it just was too hard for me  it was like i m okay drinking the ketones once a while, but i can t drink them every day  and it s like i just couldn t suffer through this  tim ferris   it s the existential equivalent of the ketones   peter attia   yeah, yeah, yeah  so then i was talking to a mutual friend of ours, dan loeb  and so dan and i were talking about this, and i m hanging out with dan for like a day  and guy like in the day that we re hanging out this one day, he meditates twice for like 20 minutes   tim ferris   for those people who may not know, one of the most preeminent and successful hedge fund managers in the world   peter attia   yes, and also just a super cool, funny, thoughtful guy who obsesses over all the same stuff, which is why we all hang out  so dan was doing like 20 minutes of transcendental meditation a day, and so, you know, we started talking about it  he said,  look, i gotta introduce you to my guy   and so he introduced me to his guy in new york, and this guy really put a lot of things in perspective for me, right  he s like,  look, it s not that there s any method that s good or bad  i think the key is finding the one that works for you   this guy happens to teach transcendental  he s made a pretty good case why i may find the most benefit in that   tim ferris   what was the case?  peter attia   the case is basically when you look at focused attention and open monitoring, for people who tend to be really, really restless it s hard because they have to focus on something that by its very nature is against what they do  he knew a lot of about me, and i think guys like me and dan loeb are sort of similar in that sense  i mean, i have a hard time sleeping because i m trying to think of 200 other things to do  i think the reason he thought transcendental or automatic self transcendenting meditation would be valuable is  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    that it would allow thinking  i think he described it as allowing the thinking mind to experience a quieter level of thought  and he s like,  i think for you, peter, that could be more beneficial than trying to just be present   so i think what i would say, tim, is i m in the early stages of exploring that  i am committed to figuring out ways to reduce my level of stress because if i want to get serious about doing all these things that we re all obsessed with, i think you ve got to take a full and comprehensive approach to it  i mean, this is questions about me, but tell me your experience on this because i know you must think about this a lot  tim ferris   sure  i had a very similar experience exploring meditation, and the only meditation that really stuck for me was transcendental meditation  there are aspects of many of the organizations that teach tm that bug the shit out of me  with any subculture you can have a certain degree of sort of culty vibes, and i think that s true for many, many different groups  but as a technique i found it extremely secularly useful as a way of giving the mind a warm bath was one of the expressions that i heard  are you at the moment repeating word or a mantra? is that the general technique that you re using, or are you doing something else?  peter attia   no, no, no  i m not even there yet actually  i m still doing my very slow peter attia sort of reading about it, find out who the gurus are, yeah   tim ferris   yeah, so i found generally speaking the reason transcendental meditation has been the most successful is it s kind of like   what s the expression   it s a terrible system, but it s the best one we have  i don t think that tm is terrible, but it has had a stickiness for me beyond everything else that i ve tried  i think that for me there are a couple of reasons for that  number one, i was held accountable, so i paid for a teacher  and i had to meet with that teacher once a day for four days and meditate two times in between sessions and then report back on those sessions  and there was a risk of embarrassment and a sunken cost that i think facilitated my practice  that was number one  it wasn t just up to me, and there was a cost   a social cost and a financial cost   to not doing it  the second is they made the game   this teacher made the game  winnable  so i think that meditation is often very uncompromising in the same  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    way that let s just say 100 percent pure paleo or 100 percent strict veganism, they might be effective for certain people, but 99 percent of the folks out there will never stick with it for more than two weeks because they re too prohibitive  and you can t win  it s hard to win   inconvenient to win  whereas with tm, it s like, look  if you sit down and you meditate for 20 minutes and you say your mantra or your word two or three time and the rest of the time your monkey brain is just running through your to do list, that s okay  you have meditated, and that was a successful session  so setting a frame through which i could look at mediation and not feel like i had failed if i was thinking about some stupid, you know, offhanded asshole comment that some guy made to me in a salad line in college for like ten minutes or whatever the hell i m like thinking about, you know  and then when i ve tried to meditate before, i m just like,  i am terrible at this  i can t believe i thought about transformers 3 and like megan cox for like 15 minutes   like i m terrible at this, and i would get really frustrated  and i would quit, and this teacher was like,  no, it s fine  you re still deriving a lot of benefit from sitting with good posture and breathing deeply even if your mind is going crazy and kicking and screaming  and feeling like i was winning, i feel like this should make sense to you because we re both so competitive  peter attia   no, no  it completely does, and i m glad to know i m not the only one that really sucked at open monitoring   tim ferris   i was terrible  so for me i have mediated regularly  i continue to experiment with, for instance, yoga type calisthenics with particular types of breathing rhythms that i m interspersing with the mediation  but typically if i meditate, for me the magic number is about 20 minutes, if i can sit for 20 minutes  and i think a lot of it quite frankly has nothing to do what s going on in my head  it has everything to do with sitting still   completely still   and breathing deeply for 20 minutes  and for me having a noise to repeat, and i don t like using the word mantra because it sounds too woo woo new agey but having a sound to repeat incessantly and they would hate me to describe it this way   but it drowns out a lot of the banter in a way that trying to concentrate on an imaginary candle flame cannot do for me  and so for me i found it very, very helpful, and without fail if i do it for a week straight    copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    first thing in the morning, you have to do it like as soon as you wake up, push yourself up and lean against a wall and do it, or it ll start to fall away   i find it tremendously helpful  and i deal with things in a much more relaxed, effective way  so that s my very longs two cents  peter attia   no, that s great to hear  so, yeah, it s a chapter that i must get to   tim ferris   switching gears to the purely materialistic, i m curious  what is the best  100 you ve spent recently    100 or less? what is the item, the service, the anything that you ve spend  100 or less on that has been most worthwhile or helpful or enjoyable in recent memory?  peter attia   actually, this is kind of funny  about a month ago my daughter who is six, we d try maybe like once a month to go and do a daddy daughter date  so we ll go downtown to a hotel  go out for dinner  the one thing is for a six year old, she has a remarkable palate  so if it s not like sushi or esoteric indian food, she doesn t want it  so i can actually eat food i want to eat  and then we ll go back to the hotel, watch a movie, go to sleep  it s really a time i cherish  so we were walking back to the hotel, and one of those rickshaw guys came up with a fully lit up bike  and i mean i just normally like would never even think about like hopping a ride on one of those things, and i could just see this look in her eye that was like,  wow, like, his bike has lights all over it   so it s like, let s hop on  and so this guy gave us a ride back, which probably cost  20, so not even  100  and, believe me, it s  20 more than we should have spent to just walk home, but the look on her face was worth every dollar i have  so, i mean, i just got a little cheesy and clich  because old dads are like that, but that s the best  20 i ve spent in a long time   tim ferris   cool, no, that s a good answer  i don t want people to have this image of you as a really nice guy though, so i m going to ask another question, which is,  when you think of the word  punchable  whose face is the first one that comes to mind?   peter attia   it s funny  i m a pretty spicy, ornery guy  it s generally not directed towards individuals  i m sure if given enough time, tim, i could come up with ten, but there are sort of things that happen that i wish i could punch  like i m completely disturbed by the system of healthcare delivery in the united states, and if there was someone i could punch for that, i would  but i don t know who to punch  there s no one person  i m completely just torn in pieces  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    by the utter state of nutrition science in this country  and yet i don t think knocking one person unconscious would fix it  of course, by the time we re off this call, tim, i ll remember 20 people, and i ll text them to you  tim ferris   perfect  i can put those in the show notes in order of preference  maybe an easier question or a less loaded one, when you think of the word successful, who is the person who comes to mind?  peter attia   there are a couple of people i ve met with who i ve just gotten to know that just really define success for me  one of them is a friend of mine  actually, it s the guy who emailed me about wanting to sort of think about transitioning from iron man to other things  his name is john griffin  he s also a very successful hedge fund manager in new york, and john and there s a couple other people i know like john, another guy by the name dennis calabrese who s the president of john and laura s foundation  we ve become very close friends  these are guys that i just view as successful because they ve done something i want to be able to do so badly one day  so it s actually something my brother and i talk about a lot, which is how do you balance trying to be successful in the career that you set out to do and at the same time be as exceptional in your personal life? and so my brother who is a very successful federal prosecutor has four kids under the age of five, and he thinks a lot about being as good a prosecutor as he is being that good a father  and, in fact, this longevity manifesto that i ve written, he s actually writing his called the fatherhood manifesto  and so in many ways that s what success is to me  success is,  do your kids remember you for being the best dad? not the dad who gave them everything, but will they be able to tell you anything one day? will they able to call you out of the blue, any day, no matter what?   are you the first person they want to ask for advice? and at the same time can you hit it out of the park in whatever it is you decide to do as a lawyer, as a doctor, as a stockbroker, as a whatever?   tim ferris   one of the perennial challenges it would seem  very cool  well, i want to give us just a few minutes in closing, and for those people listening links to resources, books, etcetera will all be in the show notes  so that s at 4hourworkweek com   all spelled out   and just click on podcast, and it ll take you right to a whole list of episodes and the newest one will be at the top, namely this episode probably  i wanted to just give a bit of info on one of your current  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    initiatives, and i m involved  but perhaps you could talk about the fatty liver project  peter attia   yeah, it something i m super jazzed about  so fatty liver disease is a disease that many people probably haven t heard of, but it s kind of a remarkable epidemic  it s a condition that was either barely existing 20 years ago, or if it did exist, it was so small we didn t know it  in the year 2000 about 1 percent of liver transplants in the united states were the result of this condition   non alcoholic fatty liver disease   which is a form of liver failure that looks just like alcoholic cirrhosis except there s no alcohol involved  today about 10 percent of liver transplants in the united states are a result of this, and ron busuttil and other experts have suggested that by 2020 this will be the single most common cause of liver transplant in the united states  and that by 2025, 5,000 people a year could die waiting for livers in this country as a result of that  so believe that there s a nutritional component to this  that s why nusi is working on this  and after we spent the better part of four months interviewing 38 gastroenterologists and hepatoligists around the united states and meeting with them over the course of two weeks, we gathered from them that there were three likely hypotheses for what was driving this disease  so the first is over abundance of calories, so just too many calories and then you get fatty liver disease  the other was an overabundance of carbohydrates, and the third hypothesis was an overabundance of sugar, specially fructose   the simple sugar within table sugar and high fructose corn syrup that makes it really sweet   tim ferris   or agave nectar   75 percent fructose   peter attia   correct  sure, agave, honey, things like that  so we said, look, here s all the data  every week a new experiment comes out that sort of waffles one way or the other, and it was like the more we talk to these guys the more we realize there were simple things that weren t even know  like, it s not actually known what the natural history of influx between nafld and nash  so those are just two technical terms that describe the state of when you just have fatty liver versus when you have something called steatosis  so we realized that there needs to be a really crucial experiment   a relatively small experiment by the way, certainly by nusi standards but a very crucial experiment   that just answers the question very simply, what happens when you  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    change the diet of a child who has biopsy proven fatty liver disease? and to do this you ve got to be able to feed the child every meal, every day  and because you re not gonna lock them up in the hospital, you have to be able to feed their family every meal of every day because you can t have a kid eat one thing and have their siblings and their parents eat another  you ve got to feed their entire family, and so this very small initial experiment that s going to pave the way to what the longer, larger experiments do basically has to take these kids and for two months feed them every meal and then check based on their mris how does the amount of fat in their liver change  and you do that in parallel with a group that you re not feeding anything to, and that s the control group that you re going to see the natural evolution between nash and nafld  and so this experiment is about  1 2 million  again, it sounds like a lot of money, but actually for a major nutrition science experiment, that s actually a pretty low cost  and, tim, a couple of months ago you called me and said,  look, i ve got this idea, which is i want to sort of kick off a campaign, and i want to give you a bunch of appreciated twitter stock  where do you think it could go?  it was sort of perfect timing because i thought,  i could go exactly to that study because you had 20 people that kick in  50,000 of their favorite appreciated stock, you ve all of a sudden funded this thing   and the way i look at it is fatty liver disease, we re going to look back at this one day, and we re going to look back at people who played a role in helping figure this out kind of the way we look back at other things that have changed the game in biomedical science  one of my favorite examples is certainly the development of the birth control pill, which we just take that for granted today  it s important to remember that in the  50s and  60s   certainly in the  50s, i m sorry   post world war ii, late  40s and early  50s, that was a completely taboo thought  nobody was going to fund research in oral contraceptives nobody  and it actually took a woman by the name of catherine mccormick who was a philanthropist to come along and say,  this is a really important thing  i m gonna fund this myself   and she funded it to the tune of about  20 million, and by the early 1960s we had the first working version of oral contraceptives  and if you look at the literature of the number of women that occupied  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    the workplace before and after oc s came out, it s like this unbelievable graph  and so it s easy to take that for granted today, and i hope that one day we take for granted that people don t have fatty liver disease  but as it stands today, seven million children have fatty liver disease, and 40 million adults in the us have fatty liver disease  tim ferris   what were the numbers again?  peter attia   seven million children in the us and 40 million adults  those are the cdc numbers, which are the most conservative   tim ferris   jesus   peter attia   and i like to use those  i ve heard other estimates north of 60 million americans with fatty liver disease  but if we go with the most conservative, it s seven million kids, 40 million adults  the study we re talking about, tim, this pilot study, is gonna be done in kids because i think the urgency s even greater there   tim ferris   no, definitely  part of the reason this study is of great interest to me, number one, like you said i think it s an astonishingly inexpensive target for an experiment that could really create sort of a phase shift and spur many developments and a lot more research in the right direction  so, i mean, i would imagine there are all sorts of implications once you ve identified   hopefully identified   causal factors or lack of causality related to certain things with fatty liver disease that that then opens the door for new studies related to different types of visceral fat and all sorts of metabolic conditions  so this is very exciting to me just as kind of a lead domino, and for those people listening   and you wouldn t be hearing me say that sentence if you weren t listening, so welcome to the show   but i think that the research can be very expensive  and this is sort of a really attractive, minimum effective dose sort of like throwing a rock at an avalanche to start it  so what i m going to do in the post that accompanies this podcast on the blog, you can go to 4hourworkweek com and click on podcast, or you can go to 4hourworkweek com podcast  they go to the same place  and click on this episode, and i will give you all information related to how you can learn more about this  it s very exciting to become citizen philanthropists as it  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    relates to science  i ve had the good fortune of being involved with quite a few studies over the last several years, and it s really exciting to feel and in fact be part of something like that  so is there anything else that you feel, peter, people should know about this that i m leaving out? peter attia   no, you ve done a great job, tim  i think your blog post will reiterate some of these points, and we re super excited  we agree  this is about dominos, and i certainly want to know once and for all what he dietary triggers of this are  i m not sort of quiet about my own hypotheses, but, boy, we certainly need better than best guesses to change policy around what we do and don t want to see people eating a lot of   tim ferris   yeah, absolutely  and just as a side note to those people listening who want to become more involved with giving to causes   or organizations  when people hear the word  cause,  i think sometimes it sounds like you re doing it to get a pat on the head and feel good about it  i do things like work with nusi because i care about results, and i judge nusi and other organizations i work with in the same way that i would judge a very lean, for profit startup  i mean, i want to see the metrics  i want to see the inputs versus the outputs, the costs  for those people interested in getting a taste of that, consider if you have stock that that can be a much more efficient way to go about it because rather than just say selling  100 worth of stock paying 30 percent or 30 to 40 percent in taxes or more and then giving the remaining, say,  60 to a nonprofit or an organization, you can donate the stock   directly transfer that stock   and then they get the benefit of and you get the tax benefit of that  100  and, obviously, talk to your accountant and so on, but this is something that i feel stupid for not realizing earlier  i can basically in some cases nearly double my impact just by giving appreciated assets as opposed to post tax dollars  so something to think about  peter, any final words? where can people learn more about you? obviously, nusi org  people can check out nusi, n u s i org  how about your blog, any other places that people should look for you?  peter attia   yeah, my blog i don t write that often just because my day job takes up too much of my life, but the blog is eatingacademy com  there s a lot of stuff on there about ketosis and exercise and  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    science and nutrition and things like that  and that s about it  i m not a big guy  i don t hang out that much in the ether  tim ferris   well, i think that s probably partially why you get so much done  you re not busy clicking on cat videos and god knows what else  well, peter, it s always fun to hang out  i hope to see you in person again very soon, and thanks so much for taking the time to be on the show   peter attia   thanks very much, tim  this was a blast and happy to do it again   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all

64,65,"65: Dr. Peter Attia, Part 2 ","show notes and links at tim blog podcast peter attia   i m going to do something that feels incredibly awkward   tim ferriss   hello ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, this is tim ferriss and i am walking in flip flops down the sidewalk in san francisco where the birds are singing  i just passed by, kind of headficked and slalomed around  there appears to be a homeless guy or startup founder doing slow motion karate chops on a tree either tripping his balls off or coming up with the next billion dollar company, who knows  in any case, all is right with the world  this episode is a follow up episode with dr  peter attia  this is by popular demand  as soon as many of you listen to episode 50, which was the first episode with peter, that was dr  peter attia on life extension, drinking jet fuel, ultra endurance, human and more, immediately after that you asked for a round two  so many many of you submitted hundreds of questions  those were voted up, and he answers the top 10 to 15 of those in this episode  why does it always sound like beirut during wartime in san francisco? god dammit people  anyway, this is a really really fun episode  it s hilariously awkward for peter in the first few minutes  give him four to five minutes to really get into the flow and i promise you this is well worth a listen  i learned so much about blood testing, and i know a lot about it already  i learned so much about the supplements he takes and why and the supplements he does not take and why, how he thinks about long term ketosis, the value or lack of value in it, and on and on and on  so please enjoy  you can always find show notes, links, all that good stuff at fourhourworkweek com podcast, and without further ado, please have fun with peter attia   peter attia   i m going to do something that feels incredibly awkward so i ask you to bear with me, which is basically sit here and have a monologue with myself for the next hour or so as i answer at least a subset of these questions  so hopefully this isn t as awkward for you as it is for me  all right, so basically looking through a list of a couple hundred questions that you have posed, and what i m going to try to do is address about ten or 11 or so  so let s start  first question, which is submitted by someone that says,  cinema   i don t know if that s the person s name, but it says,  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved     what are the top five biological tests, blood work, hormones, etc , everyone should get?  this is a tough question, because i don t know the answer to it in the sense that i think there are different, you know, the top five for one person are probably different than the top five for the other  so i d have to know a little bit more about the risks that a person faces, right? meaning, are they more at risk for cardiovascular disease? are they more at risk for cancer? are they more at risk for neurodegenerative disease down the line? or are they dealing with an acute problem at the moment? you know, they have really horrible energy or really poor sleep or excess amount of body fat or something  and so you have to know a little bit about which of those things the person wants to determine if you could only have five tests  now with that said, let me take a crack at it through my lens, which is a lens of preventing death  so these aren t necessarily the tests you d order if your goal is to make somebody feel better in six weeks or six months even, but this is probably the five most important things i would order to mitigate the long term death, basically to extend longevity  so the first thing i d want to know is i d want to know somebody s apoe genotype, and the reason i d want to know that is though it doesn t determine your fate, it certainly helps us understand out of the gate what diseases you may be more or less at risk for  so the apoe gene codes for proteins that are involved in the metabolism of cholesterol, but in particular they play a really important role in the development of cardiovascular disease and alzheimer s disease  and so knowing somebody s apoe status allows you to determine what you need to do to mitigate those risks, both through nutrition, but also through pharmacology  there s nuance to this as well  somebody with an apoe 4 4 or apoe 3 4, which are variants on the wild type which is a 3 3, these are people i will always want to make sure, for example, that they have desmosterol levels that are maintained  desmosterol is a cholesterol that we synthesize  i d also want to be thoughtful before putting them on medication that could interrupt with cholesterol synthesis in the brain and things like that  okay, the next thing i d want to know, and these two sort of go hand in hand is ldl particle number, via nmr, and lp a particle number, also via nmr  so nmr is a technology that can count the number of lip protein particles in the blood, and the ldl particle, as its name suggests, counts all of the ldl particle  so an ldl particle is a particle that is defined as a lipoprotein with an apoe b 100 apoe lipoprotein on it  these are the dominant particles that traffic cholesterol in the body, both to and from the heart, by the copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    way, and to and from the liver, but they sort of gain their fame because these are the ones that traffic sterols into the subepithelial space where it leads to atherosclerosis  and we know, i would say beyond any shadow of a doubt, but some might dispute that  we know beyond any shadow of a doubt that the higher the number of those particles, the greater you are at risk for cardiovascular disease  so i like to know that, and again, that tells me where to focus on reducing it  some people have that number elevated because of genetic reasons, and other cases it s very lifestyle driven  now the subset of that is this thing called lp a  so lp a is another ldl particle, but it also has another apolipoprotein on it called apolipoprotein a  now i know what you re thinking, which is,  could they come up with worse names?  and the answer is,  maybe   but nevertheless, the lp a particle is perhaps the most atherogenic particle in the body, and while it s included in the total of ldl particle numbers, i definitely want to know if somebody has an elevated lpl a particle number, because that in and of itself, independent of the total ldl particle number, is an enormous predictor of risk, and something we ve got to act on, but we do so indirectly  in other words, diet, drugs don t seem to have any effect on that number, so we pull the lever harder on other things  let s see, that s one, two, three  okay, the next thing i think it s worth doing on pretty much everybody, if you re trying to evaluate their risk of metabolic disease or just figure out what s going on at the moment, is a very simple test called an ogtt, an oral glucose tolerance test  and while simple in concept, it s sort of a pain to administer which is why most people don t get it done the way i would like it done, which is a time zero, time one hour, and time two hour test that looks at insulin and glucose  so out of the gate you have a glucose and insulin level, you drink the 75 gram sort of nasty cola like drink that contains 75 grams of glucose in it, and then one and two hours later you have this repeat blood draw  and why i think this test is important, especially is what you see at the one hour mark  a lot of people skip that and they just go straight to the two hour mark, but that one hour one is where we see the early warning signs  so a lot of people don t meet the criteria for diabetes, meaning they have a normal hemoglobin a1c and they don t have a glucose over 200 in response to this test, but when they start to get very elevated levels of insulin at that one hour mark, and elevated is sort of a subjective term  i would define elevated as anything over 40 to 50 on the insulin, and that s subject to the lab, that s based on the lab, that i use  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    i know that that person is hyper insulinemic even if not while fasting, and that s a harbinger for sort of the metabolic problems that we re trying to ward off  let s see, one more  i think it would be a toss up for me  it really does depend on what the person is at risk for  i like to see a person s igf 1 level, insulin like growth factor one  we know that this is a pretty strong driver of cancer, so if we have a person who is at risk for cancer or who themselves is a survivor of cancer, we really want to do everything we can through diet, both the type of food and the amount of food that they consume, to keep igf 1 levels low  so i guess that would probably make my top five list  okay, next question  this is by someone named bezo  it says,  in the fitness community, it is widely accepted that carbs after workouts help enable protein synthesis with the anabolic window, but i ve seen studies disprove this  what have you seen and what do you know in regards to this theory?  so okay, so the question basically is should people eat carbohydrates following weight training to promote anabolism within the muscle? at least, that s the way i ll try to answer the question  so i think the short answer is it depends what you are optimizing for  so if you are a body builder, or if you are somebody who s primary objective is to increase hypertrophy, which is just the technical term for muscle size, then yes, i think there almost assuredly is a benefit from consuming carbohydrates and or whey protein  remember, whey protein is going to spike insulin as well  it s an already relatively simple form of amino acids that s quite insulogenic  and so i m not   actually, that s not true  i am actually aware of a study that i believe tried to compare carbohydrate versus a whey isolate, and unfortunately i can t recall the difference between them if there was one  but the point is, they re both quite insulogenic  so yeah, if your goal in life is to sort of increase the size of your muscles, then i think that s going to be a positive thing to do  keep in mind that for some time now body builders have used insulin, just straight up insulin, as a  performance enhancing drug   i say performance enhancing, because really, i don t know what performance means in body building  but in as much as they ll use anabolic steroids, they ll certainly use insulin in a building phase, not a cutting phase  because remember, insulin is anabolic to fat and muscle  so unlike testosterone, which is of course anabolic only to muscle and it s catabolic to fat  so what s the flip side of that? the flip side of that is if you re somebody like me, for example, who, i mean, could not care less about the size of his muscles, then no, in fact, the answer is i don t do that  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    in fact, i m at the point now, you didn t ask this question but i guess since i m on the topic, i don t even consume whey protein post workouts anymore  so when i lift weights, which i do twice a week, i do it basically fasted, just drinking water, and postworkout i consume nothing  now what i acknowledge is i am missing out on the opportunity to increase muscle size, muscle mass, potentially even strength with the slight breakdown of muscle, but you see, i don t care about that as much as i compare about a few long term things i m tweaking that involve some sort of caloric restriction that i like to do  so again, neither one is right nor wrong, but it s really a function of what you re optimizing for  okay next question  this is by someone named hapax  it says,  in the previous tim ferriss interview, you mentioned discussing what supplements to take, but ran out of time  what are your top 10 supplement recommendations, and do you describe to periodization even for everyday supplements such as vitamin d?  i mean, i m certainly happy to answer what supplements i take  i m not sure how relevant it is to the listener because there s few things that i believe just taking out of the gate for everybody  in other words i sort of, with my patients at least, take a very tailored approach to what they should or shouldn t take  so what do i take? i take vitamin d, i take a baby aspirin, i take methyl folate, i take b 12, i take epa and dha omega 3 fatty acids, and i take berberine  i think that s all i take, and you could argue baby aspirin is not really a supplement, but i count it as one i guess  okay, so why do i take those? what do i not take? i do not take a multivitamin, i do not take vitamin a, i do not take vitamin c, i do not take vitamin e, i do not take vitamin k, although i have flirted with vitamin k a little bit and i have some interesting thoughts on that for certain people  oh, i also take a probiotic, which i do actually periodize, and i actually deliberately cycle the dose of that throughout the week  so on the ones i do take, the reason i take them is basically all i m managing to certain levels  so i have target levels for vitamin d, and i can t get to them without supplementing, so i supplement  i have an mthfr mutation, which means, and these are not that uncommon by the way, so it s not like i m a two headed freak, but that mutation means i don t do a good job methylating folic acid, and so as a result, i take methylated folate to get around that problem  i also can t seem to get my b12 levels to where i want them to be  i can get them into the  green zone,  but i aspire to actually have a slightly higher level, so i need a very low dose of that supplement  and again, to the point about periodization, i do take my vitamin d every day  i sometimes double up on days that copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    i know are going to be brutally stressful  on the methyl folate and the b12 and i also take b6 for another reason, i do actually rotate those, but that s less because i believe that periodization is necessary and more just to minimize the number of pills i take a day, and because i don t need them every day i generally only take them twice a week  and again, i m doing this to titrate to a very specific dose  so i m really using my blood levels to determine how much or how little i need of these  i think the only one i haven t addressed is berberine and baby aspirin  so baby aspirin i take because my aspirin works test lights up  what that means is, if i m not on a baby aspirin, i pee into a cup, the lab does a test on that to determine how sticky my platelets are, the answer is very sticky  so a baby aspirin, which is just a quarter dose of an aspirin, actually inhibits the functionality of platelets in a way that doesn t lead to massive bleeding if i get a cut, but takes the  edge  off that feature  and actually what i will do there is i will increase that to a full aspirin, meaning four baby aspirin, any day that i m doing a cross country flight, which is usually once or twice a week  so most days i m just taking a baby aspirin, any day that i m flying, because i want to minimize even the smallest chance of a blood clot, i ll take four of those  okay, so the last one is berberine  so berberine is a vegetable extract that actually is kind of a natural mimicker of metformin on one hand, which is to say it activates amp kinase, and what the net effect of that is, and i m sorry i m going a little quick  we could obviously spend an hour just talking about why amp kinase activation is important in health, but suffice it to say one of the net outcomes is the suppression of hepatic glucose output, which maintains lower levels of insulin and therefor lower levels of igf 1, which is something i place a huge premium on  the other thing that berberine does that metformin does not do is it inhibits psck9  so pcsk9 plays a very important role in the metabolism or breakdown or processing of lipoproteins, those ldl particles, and about 10 to 15 percent of the population if i have my numbers right, and i might be a bit off, tend to over express pcsk9, and we have a genetic test for this that i frankly don t do that often in people  i tend to just put them on berberine, and if their ldl particle level drops on berberine by 10 to 20 percent, then i know that they re an over expressor of pcsk9  if they have no response, then i know that they re not, but they still may benefit from it from a glycemic and insulin level  so anyway, that s where i am on the supplement front  okay, next copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    question  this is from gabbi in toronto, my hometown no less   the evidence both pro and anti keto seems conflicting  should the ketogenic diet be seen as a short term intervention or a longterm lifestyle, and what can be done to minimize any potential downside to keeping it long term?  gabbi, this is a question, i think i m selecting all the questions i don t know the answers to, because, well, okay  so let s start with the hardest part of this  is there evidence of any society that has subsided, or any group of our ancestors or any culture, that has lived entirely on a ketogenic diet in perpetuity? now this is a controversial topic, and i m not an expert in it, so i don t know the answer, right? but i ve read everything that i can get my hands on, and i think i m comfortable saying i don t know  now historically, people have suggested that the inuit lived perpetually in a ketogenic state  i m not convinced that that s correct  i think they probably spent part of their time in ketosis but may not have been in ketosis full time  the other culture that often gets mentioned as a full time culture of ketosis are the maasai, though i ve never seen supporting evidence for that, and i have my doubts because the maasai, to the best of my understanding, bordered more on carnivore than omnivore, and it would be, to my estimation, very difficult for a pure carnivore to be in ketosis, because that s just too much protein consumption and as you probably know, if you ve experimented with ketosis, you ve got to really be, you have to titrate that protein level down quite low in addition to the carbohydrate level  so basically, let s take that off the table as, do i have any sort of natural experiment that i can point to that says,  being in ketosis in perpetuity is the way to go?  and i think the answer is i personally don t  if somebody does, it d be great to post about it and post to some sort of credible literature on it  so assuming the answer is no, that doesn t mean the answer to your question is no, right? so when we start with what are the pro and anti keto data, i guess the question is they re all surrogate data, right? in other words, nobody s done a long term study that says,  we re going to take a group of people, we re going to randomize them, half of them are going to go on a ketogenic diet, half of them are going to go on a fill in the blank diet, and let s see who lives longer   so we d want to do that, and we haven t done that  and even if we did that in animals, by the way, it s not clear it would be a particularly relevant experiment, given especially mice, which we have a fondness for doing experiments in  mice, being natural herbivores, probably wouldn t be a great model for this  so when people say this study is pro versus anti keto, they re usually doing it based on copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    proxies  you know, body weight, cholesterol numbers, triglycerides, markers of insulin sensitivity, etc  and you re right, i think the data are generally conflicting, though i would always sort of, on any data, challenge people to make sure they read more than the abstract  so i ve read probably a dozen studies that claim to be ketogenic diet studies, and then you read the methods and you look at the results and you realize no, actually these were studies that were putting patients on a low carbohydrate diet, and these people weren t in ketosis  their beta hydroxybutyrate levels didn t register high enough to really answer the question you re asking  and so if they find no difference between the arms, i don t know what conclusion we can draw from that  so, i mean, we could obviously spend a lot more time just discussing the sort of literature on this  i think others have already documented that pretty well, right? so there are a lot of documented examples of ketogenic diets being very safe and effective treatment at least over the short term, by that i mean less than a year, for type ii diabetes and obesity  i don t really follow the keto literature that closely, so i ve also seen sort of bio marker studies on this, but i don t think i ve seen anything longer than a year  so what does this mean to you? well, i spent two and a half years in ketosis, and people ask me why am i not in ketosis today? so i haven t been in ketosis for a little over a year, at least not consistently  i do get into ketosis at least once a week, just generally as a result of a fast that i m doing, but long gone appear to be the days when, for just months and months and months i would not get out of ketosis  i would just continue to consume very very low amounts of carbohydrates, very very modest amounts of protein, and high amounts of fat  i will say this  i actually felt at my best on a ketogenic diet, and to this day i feel at my best when i m either consuming hypo amounts of calories coupled with a ketogenic type of calorie, or not  but the main reason i think for me to move away from it to basically a diet today, which is sort of higher in carbohydrate than it has been historically but still lower in carbohydrate than it would be to the general population, is basically one of just a kind of craving i ve really had for more fruits and vegetables  so doing that, it s pretty hard to stay in a ketogenic diet, and i think that going forward, i would probably stay in a diet that maybe cycles into and out of ketosis, but it s less about me believing that there s a long term harm to being in ketosis, and more about me sort of scratching other itches in terms of experiencing a broader array of foods   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    that s not as crazy as it sounds, maybe having a bit of a reminder of what it is i enjoy about that  so i apologize  i feel like i did a pretty crappy job on this question  i don t think i answered your question about the downsides to keeping it long term, which i think is an important question  i guess the point is, i don t know the answer to that at the population level, but at an individual level, it s pretty clear when a ketogenic diet doesn t work  and i guess i should make that point as well  i ve probably put two dozen patients on ketogenic diets for whom it became obvious to me within two months if not less that this was not a good diet for this person  so when you put somebody on a ketogenic diet and their crp goes through the roof and they actually increase adiposity and their homocysteine goes up and their uric acid goes up and their ldl particle number goes up, i mean, i m having a hard time justifying why this person should be on a ketogenic diet  and i think for some people that s just the case  i have some hypotheses about why, but i don t know the answer  and so if you re not in that camp, if everything is moving in the right direction, if you re in the camp that i was in where my biomarkers are at their finest when i m on a ketogenic diet, i guess i d ask what s the alternative? is it going back to a standard american diet? is it cycling in and out? that probably gives you your answer  okay, next question  this is by   i can t read it  someone in new york   in the previous talk, you mentioned you perform bloodwork on yourself at home  do you see this becoming possible for the average person? what worthwhile test metrics are possible or on the horizon for average self testing people?  do i see this being possible for the average person? probably not  and just to be clear, it s not like i have the lab inside my house  i just have the centrifuges and all of the equipment, so any day that i want to draw my blood i just have my wife draw my blood and i spin it and package it and send it to my lab with my paperwork, and i guess because i m a doctor i can do that, so i guess you would need a slip from your doctor if you wanted to do that in a centrifuge and someone to draw your blood  so in essence, yes  i think anybody who is obsessive enough could do what i m doing if they had somebody who could draw their blood, they had a doctor who was willing to give them an unlimited number of lab slips, and they had all of the equipment to do this  that said, and i don t think that s that interesting, by the way  i think what is interesting is stuff that a company like theranos is doing  so theranos is a company in the bay area founded by a woman named elizabeth holmes, who i don t know by the way, but she s sort of this young prodigy  and basically copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    what they re doing is, at least to the best of my understanding, is creating this sort of black box that allows you to use just a thimble, less than a thimble, really the amount of blood you would use in a blood glucose meter  but instead of just getting glucose or just getting ketones, which is pretty much what we get on those tests today, to get just a much much broader array of tests  and i think the question is, will those devices be the things that people own? i think not, but i think their goal is to have those things potentially at a cvs, where you can go in and you can sort of put a finger prick of blood onto a strip and you can get a wide array of things  so i think those things aren t that far away  i do wonder if one of the bigger hurdles to that is sort of the legal stuff  obviously if you see what the fda and 23 and me have gone through, you could argue,  well okay, that s just because it s genetic testing  would the government be as concerned if people are getting blood tests without their physician acting as middle men or women?  i don t know the answer to that question  it s certainly beyond my pay grade  now your second question is what worthwhile tests or metrics are possible on the horizon for the average person? well, i think the sky is the limit here  again, now i differentiate between the average person versus me  i mean, i just think of this more broadly as what s on the horizon? i mean, i think everything  i just read a paper a week ago that showed pretty convincing data   again, it s epidemiologic data, or it s cohort based data rather, not epidemiologic   suggesting that plasma levels of apoe might be actually more indicative of the risk of neurodegenerative disease and alzheimer s disease in apoe genotype  that s amazing to me  so the first thing i did when i read that paper was i sent it to the chief scientific officer and lab director of health diagnostics laboratory, to find out,  hey, do you think you ll be able to offer this test one day?  and to my surprise, he responded and said,  yes  we collect this data, we just didn t know anybody cared about it   and so i find myself often surprised when i want something done that somebody has already thought of it and they re just waiting to know that there s a demand for it  okay, next question  this is from craig in la   i ve heard from several well respected people in biology and medicine that not drinking alcohol at all may be the best bio hack out there  do you agree? i may cry   you know craig, i was just asked this question at a conference last week, and i ll try to remember what i said, though i m sure i was funnier and more eloquent then than i will be able to be now  i ll start with something that may be viewed as controversial  i have never seen convincing evidence that the copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    addition of alcohol confers a health benefit  so i know what you re thinking   oh, come on, i ve heard that if you can drink two glasses of red wine a day, it reduces your risk of heart disease, blah blah blah blah blah   and i m saying i don t buy those data  i think that for some people, ethanol alcohol, up to reasonable doses, no harm  and you have to determine what your toxicity level is  obviously at some dose everybody is harmed by it, and in that sense we come back to this model of what i call the toxicity model  so let me explain that, and then i ll come back to what the implication is for craig and everybody else who s wondering if they should drink  so in pharmacology there s this idea, and i ve blogged about this once, but since i doubt anyone s read it, i ll revisit it here  so in pharmacology, we have this thing called an ld 50  ld stands for lethal dose, to 50 percent of the population  so let s take a drug that everybody understands, like tylenol  so tylenol has an ld 50  now we don t know exactly what it is in humans, because the only way you can find that out is to try and kill a whole bunch of people with tylenol and figure out what was the dose that killed half of them, but we know exactly what it is in animals, and it s been extrapolated that in humans, it s probably between 10 and 20 grams  so let s just for argument s sake say it s 15 grams  what that means is, if you had a room of 1,000 people and you gave everybody 30 extra strength tylenol, in three days half of them would be dead  and i say in three days, because that s about how long it takes to undergo liver failure and death from an acute ingestion of tylenol  so okay, so that s interesting, but how does that pertain to our alcohol question? well, if you took that same group of 1,000 people and you gave everybody five grams, you might actually knock off one person  you wouldn t probably in 1,000 because that s too small a sample, but play with me on this one, right? if you gave six grams, you might knock off a few more  by the time you get up to 15 grams, remember, you ve knocked off half the population, and if you crank that up to 20 grams, maybe 2 3 of the people have died, and if you went up to 40 grams, maybe you ll kill everybody except two people  so there s a distribution  it is often not bell shaped, by the way, but nevertheless there is a probability distribution that basically says,  eventually you ll kill everybody with anything,  and by the way, there s an ld 50 for water, there s an ld 50 for oxygen  there s nothing that s not toxic if given in high enough doses  so let s go back to the ethanol question  so there s a pretty well known ld 50 for alcohol, but that s for what i call acute toxicity   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    that s not really what this question is about, but i want to just make sure i clear this up, because this will be a confusing point  so the acute toxicity is, if we have 1,000 people in a room and we make everybody drink 24 beers, assuming they don t puke, or we could just say,  look, we d give it to them intravenously,  so we take that off the equation, yeah, you ll kill some fraction of them  so now let s take that off the table and say,  no, no, we re not talking about acute toxicity  we re talking about chronic toxicity  so at a high enough level of alcohol, everybody is going to get cirrhosis, right? but interestingly at a low level of alcohol, long before people are getting drunk, there are a lot of people who experience horrible side effects  now, the second point worth making here is it s not always due to the alcohol  so there are a non trivial subset of the population for whom the tannins within wine cause vasomotor effects, horrible flushing, horrible gi effects, and basically anything over about a sip of wine and they re not doing well  and i don t mean, like, they re ill, i just mean they re having basically an inflammatory response that s suboptimal  and the same is true for many people drinking beer  and so i guess, to answer your question, craig, the thing i always recommend to patients when they ask me this question is do an elimination reintroduction test to find out what s true for you  because at the end of the day, you re asking this question probably not because you care about it at the meta level, but probably because you want to know the answer for you  should you be drinking alcohol? and if so, how much can you get away with? and the best way to answer that is basically, knock it out of your system for one month, make no other change, by the way, and then slowly reintroduce it and take your alcohol of choice  so if you re a red wine guy, go zero wine for a month, make no other change otherwise, and then reintroduce a glass a day, and you ll get a sense,  do i feel better, worse, or the same?  and if the answer is,  i feel a little worse,  then you think you know  and if you don t feel any different, then you re probably okay  okay, so anyway, i think i ve harped on that enough  i think you get the point  okay, next question is from kirby in austin, texas   you have mentioned passing a glucose test with flying colors after being in ketosis  matt lalonde has stated longterm ketosis would induce insulin resistance  do you think your results are anomalous, and would you discourage carb carbolysis?  okay, so yes, i did several types of tests while in raging ketosis  first and foremost, i did what was called the gold standard, which is either a euglycemic clamp or insulin suppression test  i did the insulin suppression test at stanford  it was administered copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    by the team of gerry reeven  gerry reeven is a fellow who basically coined the term  syndrome x,  which later became described as metabolic syndrome  he s perhaps one of the most thoughtful people on insulin resistance  and i apologize if i m repeating myself  i may have already talked about this on a podcast, but if not   if i have, skip the next three minutes  so the way that test works is you show up in the morning, overnight fast, they hook you up to two huge ivs  so 14 or 16 gauge ivs, one in each arm, and they give you insulin in one and glucose in the other  and the dose of glucose and the dose of insulin is determined by your body weight and your surface area  and they ve done this in thousands of patients for about 35 years now, so they have this pretty well dialed in  and let s say your starting glucose was 90, which i think mine was  what they re going to do is follow you for the next six hours with this constant infusion of glucose and insulin, and they check you every 30 minutes, and where you end up when you hit a steady state of glucose determines how good you are at glucose disposal, which is really the best metric we have for insulin sensitivity  so the higher your glucose at the end of that test, the less able you are to dispose of glucose, the more insulin resistant you are  and they had just published a series looking at 440 or so non diabetic patients undergoing this test, and i believe that the range of glucose levels at steady state varied between as low as 75 to 80 and as high as 400  so obviously that person at 400 is basically pre diabetic, and that person at 75 is very insulin sensitive  so i had a very bizarre experience there, which is my glucose started to go down very quickly  so the post doc who was running my test quickly realized that i was very insulin sensitive, or to be more specific, i was very able to dispose of glucose, and so they actually broke protocol and lowered my insulin level  and my glucose level kept falling, and by the way, so did my ketone levels  so i walked into the test with a glucose of, i don t know, 90, and a ketone level of like two and a half millimolar, and i very quickly started to go down in glucose, down in ketones, and the test ended pretty badly  basically at about 90 minutes, my glucose was in the 40s, i was starting to become symptomatic, they stopped the insulin, gave me more glucose, but then i really fell off a cliff  my glucose got down to 32, ketones were near zero, now i was profoundly symptomatic  that s actually the closest i ve ever come to biting the big one doing one of my goofy selfexperiments  because they had to bolus me with pure dextrose, it s called d50, the iv infiltrated, the whole thing was a total disaster, but luckily in the end, they rescued me, and the punchline copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    is i guess i m the most insulin sensitive person they d ever measured  as part of that, i also did an oral glucose tolerance test a couple of weeks later, and the results there were quite similar  so i started out at a glucose of, i don t know, 90, or maybe 89 i think, and an insulin level of maybe four and at one hour the glucose was up to maybe 105 and the insulin was up to like 15, and at two hours glucose was in the 70s and insulin was maybe down to six  so again, that would be a great example of gluco disposal  okay, so what is matt lalonde talking about? well, what matt is talking about is there are many people, and i have a hypothesis why, for whom that s not true  you put them in ketosis or you restrict carbohydrates and, in fact, they appear to be insulin resistant  and what we believe that is something called physiologic insulin resistance  so when you restrict carbohydrates, your body, specifically your muscles, your liver, and maybe even your adipose tissue, your fat tissue, although i don t know the answer to that question, may actually get to a point where they say,  look, we re going to become really resistant to the effect of insulin because we want to preserve any remaining amounts of glucose for the brain   so when you take somebody who s been in that state, whose brain is getting about 60 percent of their energy from glucose, 40 percent from ketones, the muscle basically says,  i m not going to use up any of this glucose  i m going to rely entirely on ketonin free fatty acid   and then when you dump on that person a huge degree of glucose, it just skyrockets  because the brain isn t going to dispose of that quickly  the rapid disposal of glucose is glycogen mediated  it s hepatic glycogen and muscle glycogen  and to be honest with you, that is a much more common response than the one i ve just described  so i ll share with you another anecdote  so a friend of mine who s been on a very low carbohydrate diet, not sure if he s quite ketogenic, but he s been on a very low carbohydrate diet for about three years, called me in a panic about a month and a half ago because his brother needed a kidney transplant and he was a match for him, but went to do an ogtt and  failed  because his glucose didn t, he had a horrible ogtt  his glucose went up  and they said,  i m sorry, you cannot give a kidney to your brother because we worry that you re basically pre diabetic   and he calls me up and he s obviously distraught and said,  how can this be happening?  and i said,  tell me a little bit about your diet  okay, got it   so i said,  look, repeat the test, but just make sure that in the three days prior, you consume about 150 grams of good carbohydrates  i m not saying go out and eat potato chips, but in copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    the three days before, go out and have some rice, have some potatoes, have the sort of things that are a high quality carbohydrate, and what you need to do is basically let your muscles realize over three days,  hey, by the way, glucose is on the horizon  you don t have to shut down    and he sent me a very very kind note about a month later saying,  oh my god, i m just getting out of the hospital now  the operation went well,  implying obviously he redid the test, he passed with flying colors, and he had just donated a kidney to his brother  so a very happy ending for him, but of course it sort of pissed me off to think that the doctors didn t know this in advance  so now to the question why did i not have that experience? and i ve done so many of these tests that it s pretty consistently true  the only thing i can think of is that because of the quantity and intensity of my exercise, i think i walk around in a state of relative glycogen depletion, and as such, there must be a certain threshold where below a certain amount of glycogen, your muscles are just primed to take in glucose  and i suspect that s what s going on in me, and the other few people i ve tested who are on very low carbohydrate or ketogenic diets, who pass ogtts with flying colors  so i hope that answers that question  okay, the next question is ohedna, i think, in london,  you ve mentioned before that you eat a ketogenic diet because it works for you  how would someone figure out if it s a good or bad idea for them? what are the markers you check?  okay, so i guess i kind of already answered this one in the question that gabbi asked  so how could i sort of synthesize that so i don t go on too much more? so it works for me  i think the reasons why i described it works for me make sense  how does this diet not work for you? well, people who start to just put on massive amounts of fat, which, i think it happens  i think there are just people for whom you put them on a ketogenic diet, and they blow up  that s generally a bad sign, right? it just says that your body prefers the currency of glycogen to that of fat, and absent doing something hypo caloric, maybe a hypo caloric ketogenic diet, something is not going right  the other thing is, biomarkers that really go to hell in a handbasket, and i always do worry when someone s ldl particle number goes through the roof on a ketogenic diet  i will actually comment on that specific case on my blog shortly  because that s, in and of itself, an entire topic around troubleshooting the skyrocketing ldl particle number on a ketogenic diet, which i feel like i m now becoming one of the people who sees that a lot, and i m getting better at appreciating what some of the nuance is there  but it is complicated, and it comes down to managing levels copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    of sterols  so understanding cholesterol synthesis versus cholesterol reabsorption, and you can get clues about that  there are also, and this is too soon for me to say because i don t think my n is large enough, but i do think that there are certain apoe genotypes that do more or less better on a high fat diet versus not  the thing i would wrap this in, the bow i would wrap this all around, is be careful to distinguish between hypo caloric and hyper caloric ketogenic diets  they don t have that much in common, aside from their names  so physiologically, to put somebody on a hypo caloric ketogenic diet, most people respond really well to that when they have an acute metabolic issue you re trying to resolve  the u caloric or iso caloric or even hypercaloric ketogenic diet, meaning basically an ad libitum ketogenic diet, which is like,  yeah, just stuff your face with ketogenic foods,  that s one where all best can be off  there are a lot of people that really don t do well on that diet, and i ve sort of described what that phenotype looks like  and conversely there are kind of people like me who got away with it  i mean i just, i could mainline fat when i was on a ketogenic diet, and it just didn t matter  but i m starting to believe that people with my phenotype are actually in the minority  and by the way, there also appears to be a big gender difference  i have noticed that on balance it is easier for me to succeed on ketogenic diets than women  it s not an across the board rule, but it s just sort of a general theme  okay, the next question by christian in montreal, canada  i love the canadian contingency here   when dr  attia mentioned that cardio isn t good for you, does he mean intense cardio, or even regular folks jogging? how do i get a good vo2 max then?  okay, so there s really two questions here, but they re good ones  so no, i do not mean that exercise is bad and that you shouldn t be out there walking or jogging or doing all these things  what i m talking about is the type of cardio activity that puts an undue stress on the heart in terms of cardiac output  so what does that mean? so, and again, apologizing if i ve   i ve already forgotten what we talked about on the last podcast, but obviously we must have talked about this somewhat or this wouldn t be coming up  so at rest we have a cardiac output that s modest, right? so someone my size might be four or five liters per minute  meaning as i sit here, my heart is putting three to five liters per minute of blood throughout my body  and it accomplishes that by a certain rate, how many times it beats, and a certain stroke volume, how much blood gets pumped with each beat  the product of those is copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    your cardiac output  when you exercise, when you really push the limits of what you re doing aerobically, anaerobically, and the sweet spot, by the way, where you re going to get maximum cardiac output is sort of at that threshold level, you are increasing that cardiac output significantly  so a well trained athlete could get to 30, even more than 30 liters per minute  and you get part of that increase through an increase in heart rate, but a lot of it comes through an increase in stroke volume, which means that the heart has to expand  it has to open much wider to accompany the blood volume to pump that blood  and it s that expansion, if sustained for long periods of time, that results in deformation of the electrical system within the muscle of the heart, in particular on the right side of the heart, because the right side of the heart is less muscular than the left and more susceptible to this stretch injury  and what we then see are electrical errors  basically we see electrical failures, electrical system failures of the heart down the line  so there was actually a prospective cohort, so it wasn t a randomized assignment  we re never going to get an answer to this question in humans on a random assignment  but there was a prospective cohort study, the copenhagen cohort, that looked at people running, and it stratified them by duration and speed  okay? so how far do you run a week and at what pace? and it turned out to reproduce virtually all of the previous literature on this, which is basically a u shaped curve, an inverted u shaped curve  sorry, let me be clear, an inverted u shaped curve  which means that at very low levels of activity, the outcomes are not good, right? people don t live as long  at medium levels of activity, and again i don t exactly remember what medium was, it might have been something like 30 to 45 minutes a session four sessions a week i think might have been around the sweet spot at a modest level of activity, coupled with other types of exercise, you actually saw the longest or the best outcome, the most longevity  so that s no surprise, right? those people are doing better  what is surprising is that at really high levels, so greater duration, greater intensity, we actually saw the curve fall down  so what s the net effect of that? the net effect of that is it s not clear that you increase your longevity by exercising like a maniac  and i don t know what else to say about that, so i think i ve answered that question  now to your question,  how do i get a good vo2 max then?  now, that s kind of a loaded question, and i don t know how to answer that without taking like ten hours  so the first question i would ask you is who cares what your vo2 copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    max is, right? so what s the purpose of the vo2 max? well, and i say this as a guy who used to be obsessed over his vo2 max  when i was in high school, i had a very high vo2 max  now that i m kind of an old guy it s not as high, but it certainly used to be something i cared about  the reality is, vo2 max is very sport specific  so the number itself really shouldn t be something you care about  so my vo2 max on a bicycle doesn t translate to running, right? if you put me head to head with somebody who was a runner with their vo2 max and i m a cyclist with vo2 max, that guy would blow me out of the water because i don t run at all  similarly, we know that vo2 max is only weakly correlated with performance, even in endurance sports, and that s very counter intuitive  now there s something that s related to vo2 max that s highly correlated with performance, and that s called either pvo2 max in cycling or vvo2 max in running  so in running, the velocity that you run at your vo2 max, not your vo2 max, is highly correlated with how you will perform, and similarly in cycling, the power, the amount of watts you put out at vo2 max is much more important than whatever your vo2 max is  okay, so i won t go into that anymore, but i will say this  nothing that i ve said about the principles of training means you can t have a high vo2 max  remember, vo2 max is something   how do you train for vo2 max? like, if someone came along and said,  peter, let s see if you can get your vo2 max back to 70  i m going to give you six weeks to get your vo2 max up to 70 milliliters per kilogram per minute,  i might actually still be able to do it if i just trained very specifically for it  so the first thing i would do is i would lose weight, right? i would probably drop three kilos  out of the gate that helps you  and then secondly, i would train very specifically to increase my vo2 max, which is basically three to five minute intervals in the exact apparatus and position i will plan to be tested in  and frankly, that s just kind of an artificial thing to do  so i can train that energy system naturally without any detriment to what we re talking about, because it s a relatively short duration, or i can train it artificially just to get the higher number on the test if i cared  so short answer is, you can still have a good vo2 max while adhering to the exercise principals of longevity  okay  oh, there s another question about vo2 max  i m not going to address that  oh, someone is asking,  when can we expect some results from the energy balance consortium and any other new sea results?  this is from jeff in st  louis  jeff, the   so we ve got a lot of feedback to that effect, and that s great feedback  so what we are doing, we re actually just launching a new website  in fact, copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    it might even be up right now  new sea has a new website, and in the next couple of months what we want to do is put up a whole bunch of updates on the site, operational updates  i mean for example, the ebc, the energy balance consortium, the patients completed enrollment at the end of the summer, the data have been all analyzed, and the team is currently using that analysis to guide the design of the follow up study  so the follow up study will be designed by probably may or june, and the goal is to launch that at the end of the year  and the results of the ebc pilot study, the one that just finished as a pilot study, those will probably be submitted in the next month for an abstract, and then they will be submitted, and that will be, i think that will be an abstract for the obesity society, which presents in november, i believe  and then they ll also be submitted in manuscript form to probably one or two journals  so i m not sure what the time lag is on that, but my guess is the abstract will be the first thing that hits, and that ll be in november  but this great feedback, and yes, we should absolutely be doing this for all of our studies, just so people will know exactly what the   you know, science moves at a pretty slow pace, even though at new sea i think it moves as quick as it could possibly move  all right, so np from seattle asks,  please talk about hormone issues in general for men over 40  regarding this, what are your thoughts on testosterone supplementation?  well, i think in general, the hormone replacement topic is generally complicated  remember, there are basically four hormone axes in the body  there s the sort of insulin system, which is basically the one that determines fuel partitioning  there s the adrenal system which copes to your response to stress, both acute and chronic, but of course it overlaps with the fuel partitioning system  right? too much cortisol, you re going to partition more towards fat  there s the thyroid system, which is primarily responsible for your metabolism, certainly your response to temperature, a bunch of things that figure into mood and other things like that, and then there s the androgen system, your sex hormones  and these behave quite differently in men and women, and they behave differently as we age  so you d asked a very specific question, so let s talk about men over the age of 40  so everyone is familiar with what menopause is, which is a condition that women typically go through in their late 40s, early 50s, where basically there is a loss of the two dominant androgens, estrogen and progesterone  and maybe at some point i can share my thoughts on hormone replacement copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    therapy in women and the role of androgen in women and how you decide should you be or should you not be on hormone replacement therapy  hint, the answer is super complicated, and unfortunately gets distilled down into overly simplistic rhetoric  on the male side, it s referred to typically as andropause, which is sort of a play on menopause but referring to the androgen hormone  okay, so, boy, this is a loaded topic  it s a loaded topic because we live in a society where somehow we ve let morality get in the way of science  so we just, we have this whole issue in our society about drugs and sports, and we somehow view cheating in baseball as the greatest crime that can exist, and i m sure most of you realize this, there have been more congressional hearings on drugs in baseball or drugs in sports than there have been on virtually any important topic that should matter to congress  why drugs in baseball even gets in front of congress is a mystery to me, let alone the number of times it s happened  well, the net result of that is that basically there s a culture in medicine, sort of from the top down, that i think really tends to view hormone replacement therapy in men as a negative thing  and again, this is purely speculation, so i don t want to be taken to the cleaner s on this  i m literally just sharing an opinion, which is when i read the literature, when i read the editorials and the commentaries, what i m really seeing is, we have a bias against hormone replacement therapy in men  part of it may be justified, because i think the pendulum, when i look at sort of all the goofy testosterone commercials on tv, i think the pendulum swung too far  but the problem is, we ve completely lost the nuance of it  so i absolutely think that testosterone replacement is a viable option for men in whom testosterone levels are deficient and symptoms justify the use  now, the problem is, we have this belief that is not actually substantiated by rigorous science that, i think, overstates the detriment of that, right? so there s a very famous jama paper that came out six months ago, maybe a year ago, that was a pretty poor, poor meta analysis of a bunch of studies that suggested that testosterone replacement in men increases the risk of cardiovascular disease  now it might, but the data certainly don t suggest that  so the way they did their study, the way they did their meta analysis, they did a whole bunch of stuff  this actually could be another topic in and of itself  we could probably just do an entire segment on hormone replacement, but if hormone replacement in men results in an increased risk of heart copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    disease, it s actually not clear from the data  in fact, people are more willing to accept that hormone replacement therapy in men, testosterone therapy specifically, actually reduces the risk of prostate cancer, and when you get prostate cancer, you actually have a lower grade of prostate cancer  so the problem with all hormone replacement, and testosterone is no exception, is the numbers alone aren t significant  they re not sufficient to make the determination  so you have to treat patients based on their symptoms, and i also think that the way we treat patients has to be customized to them  so for example, it s not that interesting to me what a person s total testosterone level is, or even what their free testosterone level is  if i don t know what their estrogen level is, what their sex hormone bindings globulin level is, their dhea and their dht levels, i can t really determine   and i m assuming now we re dealing with a patient who is symptomatic, who clearly demonstrates the symptoms of low androgens  i ll probably have sort of six different ways that i would treat somebody, depending on their objectives, do they want to be on this for life? is this a bridge? do they want to maintain the ability to have kids and all these sort of things, fertility issues? so i think i ve answered the broad level question, which is i think testosterone replacement therapy is a great tool in the tool kit, but like every tool, you d better know how to use it, right? it s not just a hammer, it s a much more complicated tool, and unfortunately, there are probably just as many docs doing harm with this tool as there are docs who are afraid to pick up the tool  all right, so i feel like i m at an hour, so this is kind of the last one  i don t want to kill people on this  so it s from mike in brisbane   you re very productive  do you have a standing weekly schedule for when you do each task? do you have any unplanned non productive time?  mike, yeah, i think i am a pretty productive person most of the time, though there are times when i feel highly unproductive  i am a list guy, and this has been a trait that i ve had since i was in high school, and it s just more evolved now  now there s a book, i think it s called getting things done  i have not read it but i know people who have read it who tell me i sort of do what the guy describes  so if you re asking this question because you re personally interested in productivity, it sounds like that s a good book to read  i think it s called getting things done, and the aficionada refer to it as just gtd  but briefly i ll just tell you what i do because it s probably a subset of that  so the first thing is, i m maniacal about lists  so i carry this little leather folder with me everywhere and it has cards in it, like 3x5 inch cards  and i have a blue card, and the blue card is the top one in the little thing, and it copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    represents everything i have to do on a given day  so i don t get to go to bed until everything on the blue card is crossed out  so it sounds crazy, but i have a little box beside everything  so if i haven t done anything, there s no checkmark through the box  when i ve started the process or made some progress, if it s a two part thing, i put a hash through it, and then when it s completed, it gets the full x through it  and then beneath that i have a pink card  the pink card is everything that has to be done by friday of the week  so i fill out a new pink card every saturday morning, and that s my weekly task  and again, that s work related  then i have a white card, which is personal tasks for the month  so like get my wife s birthday present, register the home warranty, switch out our car insurance, like just dumb stuff that has to get done that i don t want to forget about  and then i have a yellow card which is long term work related things  so these are things i m not putting on deadline, but i find it very cathartic to be able to write stuff down, because it takes the stress away from me  because i find that a lot of people get sort of paralyzed by not being able to do stuff  they get overwhelmed with things  i m in the same boat  i m very prone to this  yet when i put stuff down on paper, and any day of the week, any time of day, i can pull out my little cards and i can look at all the crap that has to get done, it actually alleviates my stress  right? because it s like,  yeah yeah, you re not going to forget about it   because i think most of our anxiety is worrying that we re going to forget stuff, not how much stuff we have to do  i think of the two, the former is worse  and look, if you go through meyers briggs testing, obviously i m a j on the p j axis, and i m probably an off the charts j  so i crave structure, i crave organization, i crave order  so to your second question,  do you have any unplanned, non productive time,  i mean, i do every week, and i try to make that the time i spend with my kids  i try to basically, and i shouldn t say that, because it s still somewhat structured  right? like when i drive my daughter to drum lessons  i mean, there s a structure to that in that we have to leave at this time and we re going to do x, y, and z  but it s also a time when i m sort of releasing my agenda  for example, and this is going to sound like i m a psycho, but i don t schedule any phone calls during that drive  like, i don t want to be on the phone when she s in the car, because that s our time  and you might say,  wow, what a martyr you are  what kind of sacrifice is that?  but that s how regimented my life is  i m generally always doing something  i would probably benefit from copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    more unstructured time  i think part of the challenge is, many of you listening would probably appreciate this, is when you re trying to run a couple of companies, when you ve got kids, when you re trying to maintain some level of fitness, everything tends to be quite structured  i think sometimes i want to dip into a period of sort of,  let s do nothing for a day   i have not done   i typically don t do well in that setting  i get very restless doing nothing  i m just trying to think  the last time i took a vacation, did something unstructured  well, i ll put it this way  it s been long ago enough that i m probably overdue for it  so anyway on that note, i will end this very structured interaction of answering questions  i hope this was what people found interesting  if it is, please let tim know  maybe we can do it again  if not, please let me know why so i don t do it again  all right, thanks everyone   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    "
344,352,Dr. Peter Attia vs. Tim Ferriss (#352),"'tim ferriss  peter ''peter attia  thank you for having me in austin this weekend  my pleasure  it s been a good weekend  good view too ''peter attia  yeah  what i can t believe is, in the relatively short period of time you have lived here, you ve become essentially the unofficial mayor of austin  well, i like to get involved and to explore all the various nooks and crannies of any city that i live in, and after 17 years in the bay area, i felt like i d left almost no stone unturned  i have many dear friends who are still there, but many of them have traveled outside, and one of the places that was an annual migration was south by southwest here in austin ''i had wanted to move here right after college  gotten to know it year by year with increasingly longer stays in the city before and after the festival itself, and now it s home  couldn t be happier ''peter attia  i feel like every place we went in the last three days, everybody knew you  like the owner of the restaurant would know you, and the coffee shop, and it was   i don t think i ve drunk more coffee and topo chico in a shorter period of time as i have in the last three days  yes, coffee, topo chico and so many things here  you have   breakfast tacos is something i haven t yet explored  that s another form of religion here, right next to barbecue and a bunch of other things, but it s a cozy feel  it has a neighborhood feel, and i ve come to value that type of neighborhood feel and cohesion, which is something i probably wouldn t have paid much attention to 10 years ago ''peter attia  yeah, i ve sort of always assumed i would live forever in california, and i ve got to say, all your hard work here to get your friends to move out here, i think it s going to pay off  i think i can see austin in my future  yeah, i have a lot of friends who are moving, and i think in many respects it s defined by the fact that it s difficult to categorize  there is no one mono conversation about tech or entertainment or finance, and some people might view that as a weakness, meaning if you re looking to live in the epicenter of a certain industry, and you re in your early 20s and want to cut your teeth and live that hyperkinetic, super aggressive lifestyle while you re building your foundation for the future, that s one thing, but in my case i much more so am placing value on the general friendliness, the cultural diversity, which is not just skin deep ''it covers so many different bases here, and i enjoy the fact that you can go from a strict vegan restaurant to a deer processing plant, to an electric scooter startup office, to a cowboy boot store, all in the stretch of a few blocks  that s exciting to me ''peter attia  though i ve never really bought the argument that people in new york and southern california, which are the two places i spend most of my time are   i never bought the argument that those super snotty places and nobody s nice,  cause i do think that people are actually pretty decent everywhere including in the middle of manhattan, but that said, it s a different level of nice here that is completely foreign to me  yeah, it is  i remember when i first moved to austin and i had a number of neighbors drop off cards or come to the door to ring the bell to ask if i wanted to come over for dinner, and i didn t even know how to respond, which really ''peter attia  you re like,  what are they selling?   told me more about myself, that i was so mistrusting perhaps, but in san francisco that does not happen as far as i know  i ve never heard of that happening  certainly in new york it ll be time to check your security system and consider your avenues of getting out of the house, but here that s just par for the course and it s really been nice to embrace that ''even within texas, austin is known for being very, very friendly, and i ve met many different people here who ve moved from houston and other parts, which are also fantastic in their own way because of the general level of friendliness  so i m a fan, i m a fan  i always thought i would be, felt the gravitational pull here when i graduated and did not get the job here that i so coveted at trilogy ''it turned out being a blessing in disguise that i didn t get the job, and i think also for trilogy because i most likely would ve been a terrible employee, but that took me to nor cal, had a great stint there, but that chapter came to a close and it was just the right time ''peter attia  well, as i said, it s been amazing to be here  not my first time here, but each time i come, i like it more and more  i guess with that said, we are kicking off effectively the first episode of a podcast that you more than any other friend, although several friends have played an enormous role in the so called cajoling as i referred to it earlier, in making this happen  if this ends up sucking  i ll take all the blame ''peter attia   i m blaming you, and if this ends up doing okay, i m thanking you  but either way, i think this will be fun  i think my customary 30  is very reasonable ''peter attia  30  of what, right? now obviously this podcast is on some level, and probably on a large level, going to come down to things i think a lot about and hope to bring to people  you asked me the other day what am i hoping to accomplish with this, and i don t have a great elevator pitch on it, but one of the things is i find myself so often having conversations with people that i think,  god, this person s so much smarter than me and know so much more than me, and they re letting me be a sponger right now and absorb so much information from them  ''so many times i find myself at the end of those discussions thinking,  i can t believe nobody else got to hear that  what if i didn t extract everything from that correctly? what if there was more to be gathered?  and so it s really that desire to have as many of these conversations as possible, and be able to share them in their natural state, that i think is a large part of this motivation ''while most people associate me, i suspect, with thinking about longevity, we probably don t spend enough time talking about what longevity means  but the way i talk about it with my patience is, it s both enhancing lifespan but also health span  lifespan is the easier of those two to understand, because enhancing lifespan just means not dying, which is not to say that that s easy, but it s conceptually easy ''i think the health span stuff is harder to understand and as i have come to learn in the past three or four years, i believe for most people it actually matters more  many people think if you helping me doesn t add one day to the length of my life, but improves the quality of my life, especially at the end, that would be sufficient ''so in many ways what i want to talk about today is one piece of health span that i know the least about by far, but also i think is the one that we are least likely to talk about as a society, which is mental health  now you ve spoken really publicly about your interest in that  i knew a lot of this before you talked about it at ted, but can you tell me a little bit about that?''tim ferriss  i can, and i m thrilled you re doing a podcast because i do think just as a bit of overlay on what you said, there is so much focus on extending lifespan, rightly so, but the equal level of obsession that you bring to performance and health span, i think creates a compelling combination that i don t find in many places ''i find the combination of those interests very common, but the combination of competencies broadly speaking in both of those domains is very uncommon  so i m excited to listen to other episodes of the podcast  as it relates to mental health, i should as maybe a introductory preamble say that this is not a topic i ve always been comfortable talking about publicly ''in fact, i would say for the vast majority of my adolescence and certainly throughout high school and college, i somehow came to the conclusion that i was just not designed to be happy  that evolution did not optimize for happiness, and i just did not have the code for happy and that was okay  that i would be an instrument of competition, i would learn to be good at various things that were valued at colleges and then by the business world and so on, and that it was not worth trying to be happy, or to not just love myself, but really have a high opinion of myself ''in fact, that was self indulgent and that i would just focus on being the best competitor possible, and hopefully turning that into something that was not only of value to me to that i was rewarded for, but that would help other people, and that perhaps i would find some joy in the joy of other people, but that was the extent of it  suffered from many different bouts of extended depression for as long as i can recall really, and that is also something that you can spot very easily looking back at my family history on both sides ''if you look back to grandparent and great great grandparents, a fair amount of alcohol consumption certainly, a fair amount of alcoholism  i thankfully have not soothed myself with excessive amounts of alcohol, but you see a lot of patterns that scared me certainly, but the depression was one that i could just not seemingly navigate around  the ted talk opened with a particularly close call, the closest call i ve ever had ''this is not a common experience for me, but in college where i came very, very close to killing myself and actually got to the planning stages, it wasn t just rumination about,  what if?   i wonder what it would be like to take my own life?  no  it was a decision that had been made and i was already in the planning stages, and to give people the short punchline to that, which explains why i m here today, i had reserved a book which was going to be the last of many that i had read on this subject related to suicide ''it was already checked out of the firestone library at princeton, where i was at the time taking a year away from, and it was checked out to some other poor student  so i put in a request to be notified when it came back into the library, but i forgot to update my address at the registrar s office, and the address that i had on file after taking this leave of absence was my home address in new york where my parents lived ''so my mom got this postcard which was,  dear tim ferriss, this is to notify you that    and then whatever it was, the final solution   whatever it might have been,  the how to kill yourself manual has arrived  please come to claim your book within the next x number of weeks or it will be released to the next person who has it on reservation   whatever the postcard said, and i got this very heartfelt, understandably nervous call from my mom with her voice cracking, asking about it ''i lied  i was very fast on my feet and i said it was for a friend at rutgers who wasn t able to get the book for a dissertation or a thesis that he was working on, so i reserved it for him   no, everything s fine   but in that moment after that call i realized how these, in retrospect, little waves, small events, can be blown   or even large events, can be blown so out of proportion or seen as permanent in such a way that regardless of socioeconomic status, regardless of race, regardless of gender, people can be so knocked off course that they end up taking their own lives ''certainly recently that s been very dramatically demonstrated and tragically demonstrated with the deaths of many people, including anthony bourdain who comes to mind most recently, and that s just on the high profile side  but in my case personally i realized how my blinders and pessimism in this downward spiral had led me to really only focus on my pain  i didn t realize how, until that phone call, committing suicide would ve been like taking 10 times the pain that i felt and imposing it on the people who loved me the most ''that was a huge wake up call  so that is why i m here today, is the lucky accident that i did not update my address at the registrar s office  if that had not happened, i mean i was ready to pull the trigger, so to speak, although that wasn t how i was going to go  but it was all specced out  it s terrifying to think of, really, really terrifying to think of  some of my best friends in high school who you never would ve suspect it from the outside looking in, kill themselves  college, same story ''i just know so many people who have taken their own lives, and it always came as a shock to people, at least who knew them in school for instance  they seemed to have it all together  they seemed to have the good relationship, or the good job, or the good grades or whatever it might be  the good family  that s led me in the last few years in particular to at the very least want to focus on discussing mental health, different facets of mental health from an experiential firsthand basis, simply to tell people if assuming i don t have any type of ready answer for them, you are not alone ''this is exceptionally, exceptionally common, but it s the dirty little secret that so many people carry around and are unwilling to discuss  so at the very least i want to say, you re not alone  there are millions upon millions of people fighting similar battles and everyone you meet is fighting some inner battle you know nothing about, so do not assume that you are alone  i think in that, hopefully people can find some solace ''then beyond that, i ve spent the last few years really investigating, using the contacts and network that i ve developed through the books and the podcast and the technology investing to explore avenues and potential treatments or interventions that can certainly help people who are on the brink, get back to stability potentially, but also to take people who might view themselves as stable or normal and to mitigate against the potential of losing their footing ''then we can go beyond that certainly, but that is   my interest in this certainly began on a very personal level  how do i   is it possible i should say  forget about how, is it possible for me to manage this? the type of thinking that triggers the most dangerous downward spirals is, what s the point if i m constantly going to default to this negative thinking? i m so blessed for a, b and c reasons, what s the point? and that is a really, really poisonous, toxic mental landscape to immerse yourself into and get caught in ''is it possible for me to somehow decrease the frequency of those types of episodes? is it possible somehow to decrease the severity of those episodes? is it possible to look at my quirky biochemistry, my software in a way that i see some blessings within my day to day, month to month experience, then in some way counteract the tendency to view myself so harshly when the inevitable dips come?''long answer to a short question, but that s really been, particularly in the last i would say two years, three, mostly starting about five years ago, but in the last two or three, really diverting a lot of my attention that was going to startup investing, a lot of my resources that were going to startup investing, to areas that are related to this ''peter attia  there s so much of that stuff i can t wait to talk about today, because you ve brought a lot of people along on this ride with you, so obviously i can only speak from my own personal experience, but we have so many mutual friends who have also been heavily influenced by a sense of awareness that you ve brought to us with respect to all of these things, but also potential solution spaces that are outside of our realm of thinking ''you said something at the outset, which was that you just thought you weren t wired to be happy, which i mean i can resonate with that completely  i remember as a child my mom would always say to me,  peter, do you just not want to be happy?  i would look at her like,  i don t know what kind of dumb question that is  like it s not an option  you might as well be asking me if i want to be 12 feet tall, like i have some say in the matter  ''it s not about wanting to be happy, it s just about metaphysically not being able to be happy, and then furthermore my thought, which was even a bit more obscure or maybe bizarre was happiness was a bad thing, because you would stop being hungry  it makes you complacent ''peter attia  yes  i really  right along with self indulgence, there was that ''peter attia  yeah, it was like,  mom, if i was happy i wouldn t get up at 4 30 in the morning and run harder and faster than anybody else to   and of course, i didn t have the   i don t think i had the mental framework to probe that idea further, which is what are you proving? who are you proving it to? why do you feel the need to do all of these things? but it wasn t until quite recently that i even began to entertain the idea that being happy is not a bad thing  or put it another way, that it s a good thing ''peter attia  yeah  the double negative  yeah, right  right  just to touch on a few things that you just mentioned, which i think are really important, the self talk  jim lear, who s a performance coach who s worked with many, many of the most famous tennis players and other athletes in the world, i had a chance to spend time with him for my last book, and then also for some tennis training in florida ''he spent time with one of my very close friends, josh waitzkin as well, who s best known for being the basis for searching for bobby fischer, for those people who are familiar  he talks a lot about the inner voice  the most important coach and voice you ever hear is your inner voice  i ve learned to pay increasing attention to the words i use, particularly when i m ruminating, referring to myself, talking to myself, making a note to self ''that s a long story, inside joke guys  another time  i found myself using, perhaps very unsurprisingly, similar language to yourself  if i were happy, i wouldn t be doing the things that are very clearly contributing to my success, whatever that means  not only that, but on every possible level, if i were to find joy in too many moments, or to not feel deficient or inadequate, or loathe worthy, which is honestly how i felt for the majority of my life ''now i don t just not love myself, like there s a deep sense of, i hate to use the word hate, but it s the right word  like loathing  like how could you be so stupid? how could you be so lazy? how could you be so   fill in the blank  toughen the fuck up  you may not have control over all things, but you know you can get really, really good at doing is absorbing pain ''i get really good at absorbing pain  it was like,  okay, if you work hard and i have a high pain tolerance, maybe you can win  maybe you can be successful   i should put win and successful in quotation marks, because they re so seldom well defined by people who use this type of language, including myself for decades  but what i ve come to realize, and this is also i think a common concern among type a personalities who consider, or are told by people they respect that they should take a stab at meditation for a period of time ''there is this highly prevalent, almost universal concern among type a personalities, by which i just mean driven, like hard charging, head through walls, i can take the pain, fuck it, i m just going to grit my teeth and white knuckle through anything that comes my way, which, hey, let s face it, that serves people very well up to a point in certain ways ''they worry about losing their edge  this is the exact wording that i hear so often, and the exact wording that i use with my friends when they first recommend it  a few of them, rick rubin and chase jarvis, very specifically rick rubin, legendary music producer   that doesn t   it s not even a drop in the ocean of what rick does and who rick is, but rick rubin and then chase, very, very famous photographer  also the ceo of a company called creativelive, which is an incredible company in and off itself ''both of them recommended meditation to me, and i resisted for more than i year i want to say, because i was afraid of losing my edge  even though what i came to realize was, if you want to use your edge indiscriminately like a kitchen knife, which is only a blade, right  like the handle is also bladed on both sides, you can continue doing what you re doing  if on the other hand you ought to put a nice ergonomic handle on that beautifully honed blade so that you can use it as an instrument for its highest purposes, you can utilize different tools, meditation being one of them ''we can talk about all the different types of meditation as well, because i think they do have slightly different applications, is a tool in the toolkit that allows you to build this beautiful kitchen knife instead of holding onto the blade itself just bleeding over and over again  scabbing, bleeding, scabbing, bleeding, which is i think day to day how many driven people experience life, whether they are financially stable to not, if they are compulsively active, if they are using the distraction of constant motion and absorbing pain and seeking pain to numb themselves so they don t have to be in their own head any longer than possible, which is what i did for a fucking long time ''pardon my french, but i mean decades  if they re able to develop other skills that allow them to   i ve certainly   less than seeking happiness, i have been looking for ways to both develop in myself and help others to develop a sense of peace, even if it s 10 minutes a day, that that does nothing negative in my book, other than magnify your strengths and allow you to, maybe for the first time, see some of your weaknesses that are very often self imposed in the blind spots that have been like an invisible hand guiding your life for, in some cases, decades ''i really see no downside to that, and since i ve had two cappuccinos and i guess have some extra personality, i ll further extend my long ass answer by saying my books very clearly track my priorities in some respects  you have the 4 hour workweek, which looked at different types of currencies, time being the most valuable non renewable of those, and how to address a few rungs on maslow s hierarchy of needs ''as i ve moved along and suffered my own burnout of different types, not necessarily financially related, but certainly 4 hour chef took me out for the count  i bit off more than i could chew in part because i was having some personal difficulties in some relationships, and i wanted to numb myself  i went back to that numbing behavior, which included taking stimulants, which included over caffeinating in addition to the pills and so on  using alcohol at night to wind down, engaging in exercise that was far more painful and ridiculously punishing than it had to be for any type of health or performance purpose, and i crashed and burned ''that led to the podcast as a way to take a break from book writing, which led to the explorations and talking to people like bren  brown, talking to people like tara brach, talking to people like jack kornfield and many, many others, then led to tools of titans, then tribe of mentors  where i am now where i look at this maslow s hierarchy of needs and realize, at least for myself, let s say you cover your food, you cover your shelter, you cover   and you get up to these rungs on the ladder where you ve checked off success ''you are blessed, you are hopefully healthy, your family might be healthy, and you can meet all of your basically needs and probably have some disposable income, and yet you have trouble living with yourself  that s a fucking tragedy  i mean it s to have deciphered how to achieve, and yet not be able to appreciate, is just the tragedy of tragedies  it s this kind of fools errand that could ve taken five years, could ve taken 10, could ve taken 20, and then you see people like that who do not know which way to turn and then ''see people like that who do not know which way to turn and then perhaps just withdraw into a shell  and, you know, sit at a table with their family and look at their phone for the entire dinner over and over again  because they don t know how to emotionally engage with themselves, let alone other people  or you see the more dramatic cases where they re like, alright, i thought these things would make me happy  i was told these things were the necessary ingredients for eventually solving this emotional rubik s cube that i ve been struggling with my whole life  where i assumed that, poof, one day i would just wake up and have made  even if having made it just means you re not struggling with alcoholism and rent like your parents did or something like that ''and i ve come to realize you don t need to, and you should not, wait until you think you have all of the other pieces   non emotional, non psychological pieces of the puzzle together to start working on self acceptance  among other things  and untying some of those gordian knots that you have that you might have carried for decades since your childhood  and that it is not esoteric, it is not intangible  and you start to address some of those things, it makes everything more effortless  it makes everything more rewarding  and that, i think, is a project worth tackling ''it s a lot, but that s   yeah, this depression, i think particularly among men who are very, very, very bad generally   and i m just gonna paint with a broad brush because it makes this type of conversation a little easier  but broadly speaking across cultures, it really doesn t matter where you go  women are generally better at social cohesion and building groups of friends who are mutually supportive  and we could look at it through an evolutionary lens, but men very often biologically, culturally, who knows? fill in the blank  trained, and maybe born to just bite their lip and suffer in silence  and i do think there are certain places for that  look, if you re gonna be a navy seal commander, waking up every morning and like telling your direct reports like about your really hard dream you had, probably not like strategically, tactically, professionally, or ethically the right thing to do when you have to go out and then risk your lives doing things that are mission critical to fill in the blank, right?''so there is a time for that  but to make that your one coping mechanism for navigating life or like the   sort of the mesh that is imposed on everything else, that you suffer in silence and that the solution to that is just to get tougher, to get better at accepting pain   to use cheesy tech parlance, doesn t scale  it just doesn t scale ''peter attia  you know, when i was on your podcast the first time, which i don t know how long ago that was  it feels like it s probably been three or four years ago  one of the questions i remember you asking, which of course you ask many of your guests, is what book have you gifted more than any other? and i remember the book i mentioned at the time  it was and remains a great book  but i know have to update that answer  what was it? just for people who are curious?''peter attia  it was mistakes were made (but not by me)  which is just an amazing book on the psychology of cognitive dissonance  but of course, that now has been surpassed  there is now a new book that is my most gifted book  and amazingly, i can t believe i didn t bring a copy to austin to give you,  cause i now   i think i just buy amazon out of this book  like, i just have stacks of it all over like you have stacks of certain books in your place  and this book is called i don t want to talk about it, by terrence real  who i ve since reading the book and becoming obsessed with   actually, it comes back to you  you introduced me to esther perel  esther recommended the book  the book was one of a series of little nudges that ultimately led to me meeting terry  and of course, that book has now been the book i have given most ''but what you said is spot on, which is there is just this epidemic of male depression  and it s not always overt  that s the thing, right? people have this image of what depression is  but, you know, like a guy who s constantly angry or emotionally volatile, he can be quite depressed  so depression isn t always dysthymia  and i think that s where people miss this idea of how much pain people, both men and women, carry around  but how men have this more orthogonal way of displaying it that makes it get masked longer and longer ''and i want to go back to something you said earlier   cause it really hit home about a year ago when a mutual friend of ours, paul conti, made this point to me  which was, the way you treat yourself is ultimately how you will treat those you love most  and, you know, when he really pushed me to think about that   which is, do you want to be the guy who treats his kids the way you treat yourself? and it had to be put that way for me to think, no  i mean, if i m gonna be brutally honest, i would not want to watch my kids get treated by another human the way i treat myself  even though i think it s good for me to treat myself this way ''so again, i think the challenge is   by far, the hardest part is getting people to accept that maybe what they re doing isn t the right thing  or maybe right s the wrong word  it s not the best thing  it s not the optimal thing  i loved your analogy of taking the best blade in the world and not having a handle on it  i mean, it s a limited tool  yeah  and there are   so i would say, just to maybe put a fine point on it, going through life merely tolerating yourself   which would have been a dream for me  i mean, i actively loathed myself and any weakness, any mistake  any foible  any flaw  i was, and still at times, am so incredibly violently critical in my own head that it is not the treatment that i would wish on anyone i care about  that is not a state you have to accept  it is not programming that you have to accept  and there are ways to begin to chip away at that and to rewire it  and to reformat in a sense certain behaviors that you have experienced for so long  many of them are thought patterns, self talk, that you ve come to believe they are completely unchangeable  and in my experience, and more and more the experience of dozens and hundreds of   and thousands of other people, i ve observed in the last five years, it is patently untrue that you have to accept that ''and i think what you said is really, really important to digest and ponder  and that is how you treat yourself is how you re going to treat the people you most care about  and i think it was actually gloria steinem who had a quote   and i don t know if this is accurate, but somebody on the internet i m sure will fact check this   who said, in effect   i m paraphrasing here   but you have to remember that the golden rule goes both way  so we all know do unto others as you would have them do unto you  if you flip that around, it is do unto yourself as you would do unto others  and that is really   has very profound and wide reaching implications  when you really sit with it for a minute and   suffice to say, you don t have to accept the inner voice or the patterns that have led you to pursue success with rare glimpses of any type of inner peace  that is not something you have to accept ''peter attia  so one of the most profound experiences i ve had and sets of experiences i ve had in the past few years are experiences we ve shared together around certain plants that honestly i was completely unaware of and ignorant of for most of my life  had never really given them any thought  and probably much of the stuff that you ve talked about, written about in the past   in particular, there were two podcasts that you did  one was with martin, and i m trying to think of who the other  martin polanco and dan engle ''peter attia  dan engle, that was the other one, yeah  and those were two separate podcasts  but they were very close together, if i recall  they were a couple of months apart  there were a few together, and then a few apart  so you had james fadiman  and then dan engle and martin together ''peter attia  that s right  and then later, michael pollan ''peter attia  yep  but that first wave was probably 2015 ish  yeah, it was a few   it was  crosstalk 00 41 07  ''peter attia  about three years ago  that was the thin end of the wedge  and interestingly, the thin end of the wedge for me was around something that wasn t a personal issue, but more of a societal issue  which is i was blown away by the discussion and the clinical results that they were achieving in mexico using a plant called iboga and using ibogaine as well to treat patients who were opiate addicted  and that s something that even back when i was sort of in my residency and you would see in a city like baltimore what the effects of heroin addiction are  and of course today, it s even a much bigger issue, and it s spread far beyond just heroin ''so that just interested me, purely for an intellectual standpoint  which is, wait a minute  we have a drug or set of drugs that are so categorically addictive to so many, for which our only treatments are, at best, useless  and there s this other thing that, admittedly, comes with plenty of risks and plenty of unknowns   but it seems to fundamentally change the way a person s brain is wired  which would seem to address the root issue as opposed to the band aid  that led, of course, to me wanting to understand more about those entire classes of compounds  and that led to my first experience with them, which i shared with you  meaning which, you know, you helped me through  which to this day remains one of the most profound things i ve ever done ''and if anybody s listening to this who s thinking what are they talking about? what are these psychedelic agents? aren t those drugs? all these things   one of the most remarkable things i remember after the first time i tried psilocybin was, i don t feel like doing that again any time soon  like, these are the most anti addictive compounds on the planet ''what started your interest into that space?''tim ferriss  the interest began   and for those people listening who are wondering if we ll discuss any other tools, i think we should also discuss some other options on the table, aside from this  although this is very fertile ground for discussion  so we can talk about meditation, some other tools and books and so on later  but the   my interest in psychedelics began long ago with a close friend who introduced me to psilocybin contained in what is commonly called magic mushrooms  must have been in college  midpoint perhaps in college  and it became an annual ritual  and once a year, i would meet up with a few of my closest friends and we would consume mushrooms  in retrospect, it was very haphazard  we were not measuring any doses  we were just have a big bag of mushrooms and split it up  and then hope for the best  which is not ideally how you go about things ''and nonetheless, despite the lack of controls   and i do not recommend anyone use these compounds under uncontrolled circumstances   i experienced what i began to refer to as a reboot  and i would have this anxiety and depression plaguing me  i would go very, very deep  and looking back now, i was almost certainly consuming minimum of five grams  i m sure i was consuming quite a high dose of mushrooms  which is, for those people who might read the writing or listen to some of the presentations of someone named terence mckenna, five grams is referred to as a heroic dose  and that is a dose sufficient to flatten even the most resistant ego  i believe is the wording that was used ''in any case, i felt this decrease or even complete removal of depression anxiety that extended far beyond the supposed duration of effect  let s just call it five to eight hours  and there would be this afterglow period that certainly lasted most acutely for a day or two after the experience  and i was going into this also with none of the best practices that we know of now in terms of preparation, intention setting, perhaps  some of the preparatory steps you can take and then integration, there s none of that  so this was very bare bones, haphazard experimentation with a few friends ''nonetheless, there were these periods of   let s just call it two weeks to two months   where i was able to finally see things clearly  appreciate all of the incredible chance blessings that i experienced in my life  and make decisions about things i viewed as serious problems or challenges or opportunities  whether it was making a decision about academics, making a decision about a relationship, to either start a relationship or end a longstanding relationship  these were things i was able to look at very calmly and make decisions about ''and ultimately, after i want to say four or five years of this, had a very, very, very scary and dangerous experience which was, again, with no sitters  in other words, no sober person supervising this  any number of things can go wrong  and one is, people can wander around and get themselves into dangerous situations  in my case, i ended up coming out of my trip very late at night, walking on the side of a street with cars whizzing by me  i mean, that could have very easily been the end  and that scared me enough that i stopped  so never again  too dangerous, and i stopped ''i didn t revisit psychedelics until   let s think about this  10 to 15 years later when a girlfriend at the time, who had some very, very, very difficult traumatic experiences as a child, traveled to peru, which has its own set of very real risks that we can talk about if you would like  if you are going down explicitly for the purpose of using a psychedelic  the most commonly   in this case, ayahuasca  but her experience was strong enough and meaningful enough that she came back and said to me that she wished it for me because it was like 15 years of therapy in two nights ''well, if anyone knows anything about any of the books that i ve written or the way that i tend to view the world, that is a very, very effective sales pitch for tim  15 years of therapy in two nights? interesting  and i put that in the back of my mind  did not move ahead with it because of my fear, which i think it was well founded  i had what could have been a very, very dangerous experience or fatal experience ''things had to get much worse for me to finally decide to reenter that world  which i did, first through a guided psilocybin experience  i did not want to go straight to ayahuasca, which i to this day believe is a very, very big gun, and can be very destabilizing  i didn t want that to be my reintroduction, so i had one guided psilocybin experience  which also lacked much in terms of any type of prep, integration, or post  so it was effective in the sense that it was like a returning home, and it was a familiar feeling that i came out of unscathed  i took an absurdly high dose, because i didn t know what i d taken before  so for those people that know anything about it, i began at seven and a half, and then i did a booster at nine  which for me is such an absurd overkill as to almost defy believe at this point ''which, by the way, is a counterproductive  taking too much is counterproductive  it is not more is better by any stretch of the imagination  being strapped to the icebreaker is very rarely what someone needs  in any case, came out of it realizing that you could approach this in a safer fashion  with a container, physical and otherwise that allowed you to avoid the risk i had  that it scared me off  then went into the ayahuasca experience about six months, perhaps six months later  took it very seriously  had people sign non disclosure agreements  had someone act as my proxy to try to vet people in several different countries  and ultimately honed in on someone i spent two nights with  and it was one of the most disorienting, awe inspiring experiences of my life, without question ''the first night, i was prepared for all of the sickness and vomiting and terror that i knew could be part of the experience  and it was blissful  it was an incredible first night  second night was, without any exaggeration, the most painful experience of my life  at one point, i experienced full body seizures  some grand mal uncontrolled, uncontrollable seizures for about i would estimate two and a half hours  ended up with rug burns all over my face and hands and feet  and was completely lost  there was no contact, no footing in this reality whatsoever  and my subjective felt experience was one of being torn apart a thousand times a second  dying a thousand times a second, only to remanifest and have that repeat infinitum  it was beyond horror ''and when i came out of the experience, or the main rollercoaster was coasting to an end   let s call it six to eight hours   i was partially detached from reality for probably 36 hours  and i had very fortunately paid someone in advance to babysit me and act as a chaperone for that extended period in the off chance that it happened, which ended up being the case  and the entire time   as soon as i was coherent enough to even think in english, which took a while, i thought never again  never again will i touch anything like this  and it was only six to eight weeks later   and i should mention that my intention   i did have an intention this time going in  to the second night specifically, which was to let go of anger  towards myself, towards other people  a handful of very specific people  and i swore i d never touch the stuff again  it was just too scary, too potentially dangerous  i thought there was a real chance i could lose my mooring from a sanity perspective and never come back ''and i realized six to eight weeks later, after spending a lot of time with someone i ve known forever who i ve had a very contentious, emotionally volatile relationship with, lots of triggers  things i thought were beyond repair  meaning couldn t spend more than an hour with this person without feeling extreme agitation and anger well up in some fashion  and i had given up on that, changing that long ago  i realized, let s just call it six weeks, after my two nights that 90 percent of that was gone with this person  and completely gone  and to this day, it has not come back  and that has repeated itself or i ve seen that in a number of my closest relationships  the value of that is hard to overemphasize  it s hard to even put into words  and it s so far outside any conceptual schema in medicine or therapy that i ve run into  it s hard to convey in a way that makes any sense ''so i ve had so many people ask me, well, how did that happen? i do not have a good explanation for that  all i do know is since then, having explored this both on an experiential level, having spent time in several countries working with people who are some of the best at what they do   and i do think i ve very, very good at vetting that  hopefully people believe that, after looking at the books and the podcasts and so on  i m really good at getting a hold of people who are really, really good  and i m very good at vetting  and having explored this space also from a scientific standpoint, it just gets more interesting  it just gets more unbelievable, yet at the same time compelling  and some of the changes i have seen in people are, they defy explanation by any conventional means ''and i ll throw in a few examples  but before i throw out the examples, i want to make it really clear that these compounds are not for everyone  there are contraindications  things can go wrong  and, they re not a panacea  they do not fix everything by any stretch of the imagination  but for certain types of debilitating conditions, thought patterns, and fear, they are remarkable  really, really impressive to the point that it is, outside of the care and feeding and love of my family and myself and my closest friends, it is what i am most focused on  furthering from a scientific standpoint, certainly ''peter attia  so you and another friend, who s a mutual friend of ours so it s all this big circle of people we know, shared an equally remarkable story with me about a single experience he had  in this case, it as psilocybin as opposed ayahuasca that also took him to this place of, you know, incredible emotional pain that led to a change in a belief  in this case, it was for this individual it was a belief system around a person who was no longer alive  so someone they had lost ''i will never probably forget my first experience with psilocybin for the same reason  it s interesting  i didn t know that that experience you described came from your very second time with ayahuasca  i was familiar with that story because you shared it with me before  but hadn t pegged it to such an early time  but my first experience with psilocybin, if not for the fact that i had that experience, i wouldn t know what the hell you were talking about right now  because it seems so improbable, implausible, and impossible that something that occurs over a span of six or eight hours that is nothing more than these compounds that come from these plants, could so fundamentally alter the way we interact with other people ''and in my case, it was very similar  it was a very important person in my life for whom i d not had a great relationship in a very long time  because i simply had no empathy  now, michael pollan has written about this so eloquently, and i wish i could even half reiterate what he said  because i remember him writing about it going, that s exactly it  which is for the first time in your life, or at least for me, i m not seeing the world through my eyes anymore  and david foster wallace has talked about this so eloquently in his talk, which is one of my favorite talks, this is water  every experience we have is through our own eyes ''and these plants give you that ability to be out of that  and i still remember watching myself as a 13 year old boy in this situation  and for the first time ever, not seeing that situation from my vantage point  instead, seeing it from the vantage point of others  and that led to the most profound emotional breakdown  which, again, these are very durable changes  i mean, i m a couple of years out of this, but i truly believe that 40 years from now i will still have this exact set of feelings about this particular individual and this particular experience  and you re right, there is   how do you explain that?''tim ferriss  it s very difficult  and these compounds, many of the classic psychedelics   let s just for the sake of argument, we ll leave lsd out of the running for a number of reasons  including the political pr baggage that that acronym carries  if we re looking at, say, mescaline, which is found in peyote  it s found in the san pedro huachuma cactus in south america, among other places  and we re looking at psilocybin, found in quite a few different mushrooms  these are compounds that have been used for hundreds of years, probably millennia by different civilizations  and you have amanita muscaria which was used in europe  you have psychedelics that have been used all over the world  psychedelics referring to   and there are different ways to try to define this term   but mind manifesting is what the word refers to if you look at the etymology ''but i would say, experientially, one of the defining characteristics of psychedelics   and we probably will talk about   we might have a chance to talk about mdma later, which is in some way can be used for many of the same conditions, but i wouldn t consider a psychedelic simply because psychedelics provide what is often referred to, at high enough dosages, ego dissolution or a controlled death experience  where you cease to exist as the subject who is viewing your experience of reality ''peter attia  that is so powerful that i   again, we talk about with these sort of   in this sort of banal way, but until you experience that, that statement is so difficult to comprehend  it is  imagine if you will   and there are different analogies or metaphors you can use   imagine if your whole life, you have been the protagonist  at least in your own mind  you are the primary actor in the play of your life  and you ve always been the primary actor in the play of your life  and there are other actors, of course  all these people you ve ever met  and for the first time, you ve realized that it is a play, and you re sitting in the audience, and you re the playwright  you re the person who has the ability to look at it from every perspective and you can change the lines of the primary actor  that person known as tim, in my case  that person known as peter  if you want to change their lines, you want to change their backstory, you want to change the stories they tell themselves, you have the ability to do that  because you re sitting in the audience as an observer of this person who is known as peter or tim ''and this is similar to the type of experience that people can have through meditation  and they might describe it as instead of being outside standing in the storm, you re standing inside looking through the window at the storm  or you are instead of being inside the washing machine, you re zooming out 18 inches so that you re looking into the washing machine and you re observing what is happening, as opposed to being tumbled by it ''and, in fact, the state achieved through psychedelics and in very experienced meditators   although i m convinced that you can achieve this state pretty quickly through meditation, it doesn t have to take 20 years   is remarkably similar as best we know   or there are some similarities, i should say  neurophysiologically in the sense that both seem to not necessarily de activate but decrease activity in something referred to as the default node network  and this default node network, and peter, you may do a better job explaining this  michael pollan does a fantastic job of describing this in his book, how to change your mind  which i recommend to everyone ''peter attia  yeah, we ll link to the book  we ll also link to your interview with michael recently, which was excellent as well  even if people say they re not quite ready to read the book  at the very least, they should invest the time and listen to the podcast  and by the way, i would not suggest that anyone jump out and tomorrow go on craigslist to try to find a shaman to take you through some experience  even if you felt like that was an inevitable step you want to take, there are some things that i would recommend first  they can by themselves be exceptionally, exceptionally useful  so to come back to it, though, the ability to for the first time, view this ego that refers to itself, in my case is tim, who is a combination of many different things  the identity that we have had foisted upon us or conditioned into us  but also that we ve created for ourselves by the stories that we tell ourselves  that we ve always told ourselves ''oh, my wife always does this  my dad always does that  i always do this  i never do that  these stories that we ve told ourselves for just so long that we ve come to accept it as just a fiber in our being  to look at it and realize that you can reformat almost every part of that  or you can take trauma that you experienced as a child and for the first time ever, recontextualize it as an adult without   to look at it with a level of emotional calmness so that you can finally close that circle is difficult to describe  so i don t want to try too hard to put words to something which, by definition, if we re talking about mystical experi ''by definition, if we re talking about mystical experiences, which is a corollary to the durability of these effects   let me restate that in english that is a little easier to understand  when you look at research that has been done, whether it s johns hopkins, nyu or other places   i ve gotten to know the team at johns hopkins quite well, and i have a huge amount of respect and admiration for what they ve done, and continue to do  in many of the studies, whether they re looking at terminal cancer patients and end of life anxiety, or they re looking at lifelong smokers who came into a study specifically to look at how psilocybin can be used for the cessation of smoking, the duration of effect, the durability of effect is very closely linked to something that you could refer to as a mystical experience ''it turns out, as you would hope, there are different types of scales and measurements one can use to determine if something is a mystical experience or not  there s some debate about this, but there are ways that you can assess whether something qualifies as a mystical experience based on looking at the historical accounts and writings who we would consider mystics  one of them is ineffability, the inability for someone to verbalize their experience  that the words somehow do violence to the experience, or don t do it justice ''peter attia  colin gives a great example of that in his book  i believe it was michael pollan in his book, how to change your mind about, you take somebody from a thousand years ago, put them in a time machine, bring them to times square, let them hang out for five hours, shoot them back  can they describe what they saw? not really  they could say that it was big, loud and bright, but other than that they couldn t explain what a car is, they couldn t explain what a building is, or a skyscraper, because the vocabulary hadn t even been developed  that, to me, is the greatest example, albeit somewhat glib, of this idea of being ineffable  which is, you and i can sit here and talk about it in shorthand, but it s very difficult to explain to one of our friends who hasn t experienced this ''again, these things sound so goofy when you say them, like, these experiences  you ve seen yourself from outside of yourself  you know, if someone has an experience, i can understand why someone would look at you a little funny and say,  okay, intellectually i understand what you mean by that, but why would that matter? why would that be profound? how would that disrupt your ego?  it s very difficult to convey, and i would say that, what i ve experienced, and what i ve certainly seen and heard other people experience in their reports to me, and in writing in various books that i ve read, is the importance of the felt experience  in some senses, it s not that you have a psychedelic experience, you have three realizations, you bring those realizations back to this ordinary reality, you take certain actions based on those realizations, and based on that intellectual legwork your life changes ''it is not something strictly in the domain of words and thinking, and just thinking harder, and working harder  in other words, you re not taking the things that got you here, if you ve achieved anything professionally or personally  the pro and con lists, the spreadsheets, the logical arguments  it s not that you just get a better set of those things that you bring back, it s that you are finally able to see, and experience, and feel something like empathy, deeply for the first time, for someone you ve never felt it for  or, you feel love for yourself, truly, for the first time, and you think holy shit  like, that s what s been missing  i ve never even felt that  if someone had asked me, what does self love feel like, i wouldn t have had an answer for it ''these are the things that really stick, and i think given the plasticity of the mind, or the plasticity of the brain, that allows   one researcher put it to me   you to, instead of going to the top of the ski slope, and then taking the tracks that have been worn, and of course, the deeper the tracks get, the harder it is to hop out of them as you re skiing  but, to get to the top, and to have four fresh feet of powder fall on the entire mountain so that you have the ability to choose an entirely new path, an entirely new record to play  it s hard to verbalize ''peter attia  but, one way to think about it, for me, has allowed me to come to grips with this, because there s a part of me that has sometimes thought, this is too good to be true, it s going to go away  this newfound empathy i have for person x, or this reduction in this horrible negative emotion i ve had, that s going to go away in six months  i ve thought of something, which is, when you look at the opposite of that, which is, how often is a person s life changed for the worse based on one event? the answer is, all the goddamn time ''a child could be abused once, and that can change their life forever  again, we re not going to go into that now, because it s its own topic, but so many of the horrible habits that we carry into adulthood are really because we never became adults  we are basically adaptive children who are taking on a set of behaviors to protect wounded children  sometimes those wounds occurred very acutely  so, in many ways these experiences with psychedelics, if administered correctly, in the correct setting, with the correct integration can act as the exact opposite of a wounding event ''in other words, with something that is so acute, and so poignant, you can just change the direction of this trajectory, this vehicle  it doesn t necessarily mean it s orthogonal  and, of course, there s so much more to it than that  many people go through similar types of abuse, and they don t all have the same impact  similarly, many people can experience a psychedelic and not have the same impact  when i started to think of it in that way it started to become much more understandable why this could happen, just as something could alter the course of your life ''one of the podcasts i ve already recorded, that will be coming out later this summer will be with cory, who you and i have spend a couple of days with up at kern  it s a maximum security prison ''peter attia  yeah, when we did this, we spent this time up there with the defy ventures  the story of cory s life is unbelievable  at no point in there is cory using any of these things that happened to him when he was young as excuses for the road he went down  but, it s impossible to argue that those experience, many of them very acute, in this moment, on this day, in this place, at this time, completely set him on a different path than he could have been otherwise ''as you said, i love the idea of the stage analogy, because to me that s one of the best analogies i ve heard about how mindfulness meditation works, is it s the awareness that there is a stage  that s simply what it comes down to, and to be able to leave your vantage point as one actor to step back and see that you are an actor on a stage is, i think, one of the most empowering things  that s why is sort of love this interplay between meditation and these psychedelic agents  there s an interplay, there s an inter relatedness, there is a mutual reinforcement also  i d love to mention a few things just to give people a chance to crack their knuckles and stretch for a second in non psychedelic territory  there are a few things that i d love to suggest to people which help you to develop the same types of meta awareness that you can be thrust into through psychedelics that serve a purpose, whether or not you ever choose to take one of these compounds  one would be, certainly, mindfulness meditation, and i think by the time this podcast we re recording right now is live, sam harris s waking up app, i think, is just tremendous  i think it does an exceptionally good job of this ''there are certainly guided meditations, if you search, say, mindfulness meditation, jack kornfield, tara brach  both outstanding  sam harris also has some guided meditations that he d recorded  awareness meditation, and peter, you feel free to jump in if i don t do this justice, but awareness meditation being different from, say, other forms of meditation, many of which i have used, and still use on occasion ''perhaps one of the more popular of which being, say, transcendental medication, mantra based  it is a concentration practice, where you are repeating a mantra to yourself over, and over, and over, and over again as a way to hone concentration  although not everyone s going to love this description, to give your psyche and self a break from the incessant monkey mind  you really can reach a transcendent space where you feel like you are a point of consciousness floating if you do the 20 minutes twice a day very consistently ''that is a concentration practice  if you were thinking of a candle flame, and that were a focal point for a period of meditation whenever you found yourself swept up in thought, you would turn to a candle flame  that would also be a concentration practice  within awareness meditation, there are different types  if you re doing something, i think it s sometimes called open monitoring, where you re paying attention to anything that comes up as it comes up   there are different ways to approach this, but very often begins with the breath, so it is, in some sense, a concentration practice, but you re focusing on the breath  you re not chasing it, you re simply observing it ''then you focus on sounds, then you focus on any discomfort or weight that you feel in your body, then, perhaps later, after 10 daily sessions, begin to practice with your eyes open, which i had never really done before sam s app, which i found tremendously helpful as a bridge into then waking reality  these are all practices that help you to spot the gap between sensory input and cognitive response  it s that you become more response able, in so much as you have a tiny gap within with you can choose your response, as opposed to simply reflexively going through lift, like some type of slug that s been shocked in a skinner box or something  you have more optionality  you suddenly realize there are more options on the menu than,  oh, whenever so and so does this, i always get pissed off   there are more options on the menu ''by the way, having that basic ability, having the abcs of that awareness and control will give you a tremendous advantage, and allow you to very often get much more value out of any psychedelic experience  because, you will have had   let s just call it 50 sessions on a boogie board before they re like,  oh, cool  here s a surfboard, it s hurricane season, have fun, good luck   like, maybe you can catch a wave  chances are, your first experience is going to be getting tumbled a lot  you can steep in the learning curve really dramatically, for later, getting more out of psychedelics very often, if you develop some of this basic awareness beforehand ''peter attia  i m kind of amazed at how difficult it is for me to convince some of my patients at the importance of meditation  i find, sometimes by telling them about my own struggles, and my own journey to accept, first of all, that this was something that was beneficial, even when it didn t feel beneficial   and, two, to realize that you have to figure out what s going to work for you, but it s worth making that effort  i agree with you  i think, even putting the apps aside, it s different people have different ways of explaining things ''i remember a math professor i had in college, and this was early  i was either a freshman or a sophomore  he said something that always resonated with me  because, now you were sort of getting outside of rudimentary calculus and stuff, and mathematics were starting to get very abstract  he said,  look, if you re reading a proof and you don t understand it, assume that the person who is presenting it doesn t know how to present it to you  find somebody else  ''i think that really holds also for meditation, which is, there are just going to be some people who guide in a way that you re willing to be guided, and you shouldn t be put off if someone s listening to this thinking,  you know, every time i try meditation it doesn t work for me,  or something like that  i don t want to name the apps i went through, but there were many apps that i went through that just didn t resonate for me  just the way they talked about this didn t make sense to me  then, when you find the ones that do, and there are several that do for me, including sam s waking up, which you and i have been lucky enough, along with a number of other folks, to get the beta version of that  it s been six months  it s been a while ''peter attia  yeah, i remember sam giving it to me in january  the way sam explains it really resonates with me, and there are others that do so the same  jeff warren is also one of the guides on dan harris s 10  happier  no relation to sam harris  i just love the way he explains stuff  so, i would say to anybody who s listening to this, who s feeling sort of bearish on meditation, try a different app, try a different guide, try a different book, try another way  keep going until you find someone who can walk you through how to do this in a way that resonates  i ll just mention two others, since they re very easy to test  another is headspace  i think the 10 in 10 program is a very, very well done format for beginning this  10 minutes a day for 10 days, and it is quite well done  calm, for some people who like the background nature sounds, for instance  i ve used that app, and many of my friends really find that to be, with a female guide, to be their preferred mode of meditation ''then, you can meditate in silence  you can consider taking a tm course, as i did, which really serves to kickstart a lot of my meditation, because it costs money, so i had that sunk cost working in my favor  and, it s effectively for lunch breaks over four days, i want to say, if i m remembering correctly  you have to meditate in between those sessions, so you have homework, and you are going to feel like a doofus, and a disappointment, and feel embarrassed if you don t do those sessions  so, you have someone holding you accountable, ie the teacher to actually put this into practice for at least a four day period ''chase jarvis   i ll give him credit again  i remember chris jarvis  i ll give him credit again, at one point said,  tim, you can afford it  it worked for me  what is the downside if it doesn t work for you? you still get to meditate with someone else for four days  might that be worth it?  i didn t have a good counter, so eventually i acquiesced and took that step, which was one of the first times i finally felt what   i had the first hand experience of what meditation could deliver, which is, in some ways equally difficult to describe as the psychedelic experience ''when you have your first session where you ve completely lost any rumination, or compulsive thinking about your to do list, and it might just be the last 5 minutes of a 20 minute session, and you come out of it and you just feel this serene peace that perhaps you haven t even touched on for 10 years, you go,  oh, okay  now i get it   if this is something that i could actually call upon reliably, that is a super power ''for that reason i would say that, if you re going to commit to this, commit to it like you would a workout program or a diet  you don t go to the gym once and come back and wake up with six pack abs the next morning  for me, at least, if i take a break, and there are periods when i lapse ''peter attia  especially, by the way, if you ve eaten like we ve eaten in austin this week  yeah, we have  there s so much good food here  you have to be very careful about portion control  but, if you want to get a taste for what meditation can do, i would say commit to 10 days  for me, at least, if, for whatever reason i lapse, and there s certainly periods when i lapse   this happens to me with diet, it happens to me with exercise, and occasionally it s like,  you know what? i haven t meditated for two weeks,  for whatever number of reasons  it will take me, i would say, five to seven days to finally stop grinding gears, and shift into a calmer state  there s a certain loading phase, almost, like creatine or something  it takes me five to seven days to click into that different gear, at which point, i go,  oh, yes, this is why it s so important  now i remember  ''peter attia  there s a great book out there called altered states, which i read this year, that i think does a great job of parsing that concept out  which is  is it altered states, or altered traits?''peter attia  oh, it s altered traits, and it makes the point that it s not about the state  thank you for that correction  we would have had a whole bunch of people potentially going to amazon, going,  i can t find this book   or, maybe that book does exist, and it s completely the wrong book  but, that s exactly the point, which is, we don t meditate for the state  the state can be pleasurable  to be honest, i don t find it that pleasurable  i don t actually enjoy meditating that much  sometimes i do, but as many times as i do, it s difficult for me, it s work  sometimes, truthfully, it feels like i suck, like,  boy, it s really amazing the frequency with which thoughts keep entering my mind  ''again, i can t remember if it was sam harris or a different guide who made this point  actually, i think it was jeff warren  he described it as,  the bicep curl of the brain is not the cessation of thought  it s the recognition of the thought that then allows you to go back to the breath, or whatever the focus is   again, that s just an example of, like, that s not a particularly profound, difficult to understand concept, but it s exactly what i needed to hear, which is, don t be discouraged that you keep having thoughts  that s the exercise  the exercise is acknowledging it, recognizing it, going back to the focus  which, in this case, could be the breath, or a sound or something like that ''so, it s not about that state that you may or may not achieve  just as some people, you and i, we love exercising, so we actually get a pretty good state out of it  if exercise provided no benefit, i would still do it, just because of how i feel when i do it  for many people that s not the case, but exercise is still valuable  if you spend an hour a day exercising, it s really what it s doing for you that other 23 hours  i guess that would be the next thing i would say to anybody listening to this, who s tried meditation, who has found it to be unpleasurable, or uninteresting or whatever  it s like, that s okay  you re not doing it for what you experience in that 20 minutes  i would also add, and this just occurred to me   because, i think in some ways you re alluding to this, that   in my experience, having observed hundreds of thousands of listeners and readers attempt or not attempt, succeed or not succeed with different forms of meditation, it s very important   and, this applies to many, many different things, including physical exercise, as far as i m concerned  the good program that you follow   let s lower it even further  the consistent program that you follow is better than the perfect program that you quit ''so, if you re having trouble following a meditation program, and you ve committed to doing it daily, which is a very important commitment in the beginning, keep lowering the bar  if you think 20 minutes is too much, do 10 minutes, 10 minutes is too much, do 5 minutes  if concentration meditation is too difficult, use a guided meditation ''at one point, there were two things that i recall having been said to me  it think tara brach mentioned the first  i could be misattributing, but i think it was tara brach that first said this to me  her book, radical acceptance, by the way, ties into everything that we re talking about beautifully  it had a huge impact on me, and has had a huge impact on many people  it s the type of title that s going to scare off a lot of people, because they think it s going to be a bunch of woo woo hand wavy stuff  there s a little bit of woo in there, but it is a incredibly good book, radical acceptance  if you have any type of emotional patterns or thought patterns that seem to control you, as opposed to the other way around, this is a worthwhile book ''her guided meditation is very good, but we were chatting  i had her on my own podcast, and i believe it was tara who said,  the repetition, if we were doing the bicep curl, isn t the 20 minute session where you sit perfectly, without having a single extraneous thought occur  the repetition is, when you get distracted, and something comes up, and then bringing it back to the breath   so, you should be happy when that happens, because that is the work  the work isn t doing it perfectly every time ''peter attia  it took me three years to understand that  three years of frustration and,  am i doing this right,  and,  why can t i stop thinking,  and just all of this misunderstanding  but, boy, once you get what the bicep curl is   it s freeing, and it makes the pass fail bar lower, which, for many of the people who most need meditation   which, i think, has a branding problem  it should be called emotional non reactivity training, or something that sounds very appealing to type a driven people  emotional non reactivity conditioning program  there you go  or, just warm bath for the mind might be appealing to other people  but, meditation, as such, is a word that s become so overused, and unfortunately, could use a re brand  but, for the time being, meditation, and a successful meditation session should, in the beginning, be as easy as possible to fit into your life  you need to stack the deck, particularly in the beginning ''tm, transcendental meditation was very good at instilling this in the training, for me, at least  they said,  if you say the mantra once in a session, that is a successful session   you have 20 minutes to say a two syllable mantra once  that s a successful session  you might even drop it further, and say,  you know what? this is the goal, this would be miraculous, but if i just sit for 20 minutes with my eyes closed, that s a successful meditation session   and, sometimes i ve honestly wondered how much of the benefit comes from some of the mental practices, versus just sitting still and breathing with my eyes closed ''peter attia  well, that s actually really interesting  that gets to something i want to talk a bit about, which is the study of psychedelics  but, while we re on that topic, it s hard to sometimes study these things because of these performance biases  it s hard to disaggregate the effect of just sitting there for 20 minutes  luckily, some of those experiments have been done, which is, you take a group, and instead of saying the control group just doesn t do anything, maybe you have the control group sit in silence for 20 minutes  then you can sort of disaggregate those things ''so, tim, you ve spoken with me quite a bit about your interest in funding science, and that goes back to even before the discussion of psychedelics  but, very recently you ve made a pretty large commitment  are you comfortable talking about that publicly?''tim ferriss  i am  i am very comfortable talking about it publicly  i have almost entirely redirected, not just what i would have invested in startups, but a multiple of that into scientific research  i ve made the commitment, for me, which is, by far, the largest commitment to, not just science, but even any given startup that i ve ever made financially, and that s a minimum of a million dollars over the next several years  several meaning three or four  i expect i ll see that one million dollar amount with primarily a focus on psilocybin and mdma  but, that could extend to other compounds, which i also find to be under studied, and that have been, in some ways, shelved for decades for primarily political and not scientifically justifiable reasons ''peter attia  when we started talking about this, when you were thinking about it, i remember one of the stories that you really liked was a relatively unknown story in the world of philanthropy, unless you dig deep in the annals, about a woman by the name of katharine mccormick  that story really resonated with you  yes, it did ''peter attia  what was it about that story?''tim ferriss  well, you should tell this story, because i think it s so noteworthy on a number of different levels  but, what struck me was how, if timed right, and if thought about intelligently, where you re focusing on points of leverage, how even a single person with relatively moderate amounts of investment   and, moderate is relative, right?''let me rephrase that  how someone, or a small group of people, if concentrating on points of leverage in furthering, in this case, scientific studies, can really bend the arc of history in a way that most people would find unbelievable  because, when folks think of, say, pharma, or bringing a new drug to market in the largest scale senses, billions, and billions, and billions, and billions of dollars ''that story was appealing to me because, on many levels   but, i d love to do is have you tell it, and then i will point out the parts  if this were a kindle chapter, which parts i would highlight to go back to, to remind myself of certain things  but, why don t you tell the story? because, it s such a great example of what one person, or a small group of committed people can do  i ll leave it at that ''peter attia  well, it can probably be read about more eloquently than i can restate it  but, the gist of it was, katharine mccormick in, i believe, the early  60s or late  50s, met a gentleman  i believe his name was gregory pincus, if i m not mistaken  i think that s right  at a dinner party, right?''peter attia  yeah, and basically he explained to her that he was pretty convinced he could chemically synthesize hormones that could be served as a birth control pill for women  she was no dummy herself  she went to mit  ''peter attia  yeah, i believe so   and, had also been involved with funding housing for additional female students so they could attend ''peter attia  yeah, and her hypothesis was, if we could create a birth control pill, we could completely change the interaction that women can have with education, with work, with the family balance, et cetera  now, we take this, we listen to the story today and we think, what s the big deal? so what, she funded the research for the birth control pill  but, the reality of it is, at the time   again, i can t remember  i must have the dates wrong, but certainly it was long enough ago that this was viewed as an absolute no go  i mean, birth control was such a taboo ''what s really interesting is, she decided to fund something that was incredibly risky, that no pharma company was willing to touch with a 10 foot pole, because it was viewed as just a way to sink money into a bottomless pit that could never achieve the regulatory approval, and, again, using a relatively small sum of money  i believe in today s dollars, it s to the tune of about  25 million she sunk into the work of this guy, pincus, and one other gentleman whose name is escaping me  over the span of something like, what?''peter attia  about a decade  about a decade, yeah ''peter attia  maybe, eight years  my favorite graph that i ever saw, which was kind of the holy shit moment was, the graph of the number of women in graduate schools  professional school, law school, business school, whatever, pre and post the introduction of the birth control pill  you don t get to see a lot of hockey sticks  as one of my friends once put it, it s really cool when the data don t need statistics to be analyzed  it s not like,  well, there was a statistically significant increase in the rate at which women entered the workforce   no, no, you didn t even have to say the words statistically significant  it was a step function change ''i don t know, i thought that was such an interesting story, and i remember when you and i were talking about this a while ago  i don t even know why i told you the story, but you seemed to really grip to it  there were many reasons for it  i think, partially, being, at the time in silicon valley, and surrounded by venture capital, i saw some of the stupidest   i don t know how else to put it  just stupidest non viable ideas raise tens of millions, or hundreds of millions of dollars  let s just be ''peter attia  philanthropic dollars, or for profit dollars?''tim ferriss  no, i mean for profit ''peter attia  okay  startups repeatedly   i mean, you just saw dozens, and hundreds of examples over time of this  it struck me that we find ourselves in a unique time, which i suppose is something that goes without saying  every time is a unique time, but in the sense that, long ago   this is worth discussing for a quick second  psychedelics, specifically lsd, were through the controlled   i think it was the controlled substances act, put into the schedule 1 class of drug classification, which means high potential for addiction, no demonstrated medical application  putting them in the same class as heroin ''peter attia  and, to be clear, for the listener who might not appreciate that, even cocaine is schedule 2  right ''peter attia  which means it still has potential for addiction that everybody acknowledges, but it does have at least one viable medical application, which is it turns out to be a pretty good local anesthetic in the nose  which, is ironic, of course  but, therefore it does have the medical use, and it s used routinely in ent surgery  so, if these compounds are so useful, if they can have some of the effects ''these compounds are so useful if they can have some of the effects without guaranteeing of course  it s not batting a 1,000 every time  if you have a 100 people at random who are using these  some with direction, some without, you re not going to have a perfect record but if, if even some of the time the effects can be achieved, the outcomes can be seen that we re discussing, how did these compounds including lsd end up in this category?''it s a multifactorial problem and it s hard to say there s one causal agent but there are a few things that happened at the time  number one, many people don t realize, pollen gets into this  really fascinating  but lsd25 which was first isolated or synthesized by albert hofmann was developed on the part or on behalf of a pharma company  it was later used ''peter attia  it was roche, correct?''tim ferriss  i want to say it was sandoz ''peter attia  oh you re right, you re right  it was sandoz  and then it was later used in a program that if i m remembering correctly was cia led called mk ultra where it might be used as a truth serum for interrogations and things of this type  or to confuse and sabotage enemies of the state  and it got out into the wild and then the adventure began so to speak  lsd was widely distributed and at the time you had parents who had never experienced psychedelics  we were going into the vietnam era and we had a number of characters come onto the scene in a very high profile way  one of them being, and he cannot be even though he is often given the blame i don t think it s fair to do this unilaterally but tim leary came onto the scene  he was at harvard as was richard alpert who later became ram dass  the things exploded at harvard and they were both i believe fired  i don t think they resigned preemptively because psilocybin was given to an undergraduate when it was only supposed to administered to graduate students ''at some point leary decided that science was too slow and the way to affect cultural change was to have tens of millions of people, he had a specific number in mind and that that would effectively lead to a tipping point where all these positive effects on society would be inevitable ''if you think about the cultural setting you have a lot of young people being told to drop out of school, to resist war efforts and all of that made a number of figures including leary very high profile targets that could not in some ways be ignored by the administration  and so nixon famously said,  timothy leary s the most dangerous man in america   and you had parents who could not in any way conceive of the experiences that their children were having on these compounds and that along with dozens of other things was a recipe for political crackdown which is exactly what happened ''what you have now is you have parents who are in many cases certainly products of the 60s who have had psychedelics experiences  you have people who are in positions of power or in regulatory organizations who have in some cases experienced psychedelics  you also have studies now being conducted even though it s with great difficulty because of all the approvals and dea oversight and so on that s required that are going back to the dozens and hundreds of studies that were performed before the crackdown and rescheduling and applying more rigorous scientific standards ''that is combined with a number of as you mentioned earlier, epidemic level problems that we re experiencing that are costing i would have to imagine, billions upon billions of dollars  namely opioid addiction, depression, ptsd  if you add up the costs associated with those three if you want to be a little crass about it and just look at the profit loss it makes a lot of sense based on the data thus far to explore some of these compounds  and that s part of the reason why for instance in the case of mdma and ptsd, the fda has granted mdma breakthrough therapy designation which means that not only is the process expedited for ultimately phase three trials but the fda is in a sense a collaborator ''so instead of saying,  all right, your methodology is approved,  and i m going to apologize in advance, this is not, phase three trials are not my area of expertise so if i make any, if i misspeak i apologize and certainly feel free to correct me in comments somewhere  but the fda s effectively a partner who helps them to navigate the entire process  instead of saying,  your methodology is approved, see you in three years and you re going to get a pass fail   which is a precarious position for any compound let alone something that is currently scheduled the way that mdma is  and we don t have to get into it right now but there s also something called special protocol assessment, spa, which should hopefully if the stars align in some ways which i think they very well might, give mdma a very high probability of ultimately being prescribable, with and used in supervised settings  it would not be a take home drug in other words ''but, ptsd and specifically with respect to let s say returning war veterans or a victim of sexual abuse, it is a highly bipartisan issue  or i should better say it s an nonpartisan issue  it s very hard for someone to say,  fuck the vets   so the risk of that getting shot down politically, i m not going to say is zero because it s never zero but there are more attractive targets if you re looking for reelection or looking for press time, there are safer targets to go after to achieve that than this  and then within the scientific community looking at psilocybin which there are least two entities right now that are presenting phase two data to the fda and i m optimistic that within the next year at least one of them will proceed into phase three trials ''psilocybin has shown remarkable efficacy at least base on preliminary data for end of life or i should say, event based depression in people with terminal diagnoses, terminal cancer diagnoses  and that may end up getting extended to major depressive disorder which is to be continued  to be determined  but i ve already helped to raise funding and also applied funding myself to a study that will be looking at treatment resistant depression at johns hopkins utilizing psilocybin  and that means i believe by the book chronic depression that has failed at least two interventions or two other treatments ''peter attia  are there other agents tim? i mean loosely speaking and this is a gross oversimplification and we ll probably get into a few of these time permitting, certainly as you said, mdma has really shown pretty remarkable efficacy in ptsd  it s wild  it s one those similar to the graph you mentioned related to mccormick ''peter attia  it s just not subtle  it s not subtle ''peter attia  you don t need the p value to see the difference  no, no, no  it s i think i m getting this right, anyone interested can certainly look up maps, you can find them at maps org who have spearheaded a lot of this  but i believe that psychotherapy alone, something like 27  effective at reducing the scale measurement  and i m ad libbing a little bit here but let s just say that there is a rating of zero to 10 for determining the severity of ptsd  anything above a three is ptsd  something along those lines  this is a bit of ad lib but i think it s something between 20 and 27  decreased to below a three so they were no longer, they would no longer be diagnosed as having ptsd with psychotherapy alone  i don t remember the time frame  when psychotherapy was combined with mdma it was something like 70   just not subtle at all ''peter attia  which again we could spend just two hours just talking about the relationship of trauma and psychological damage and how mdma can help with that  the other thing of course which we talked about very briefly earlier was iboga and ibogaine in the treatment of opioid addiction which probably has the worst success rate amongst societal epidemics that are being treated by conventional means  there really aren t great options for the individuals with opiod addiction  and then of course psilocybin as you said on end of life depression, major depressive along with smoking cessation  i heard it s even being looked at now for alcoholism  it is  and there are a few predominant classes people can look at when it comes to psychedelics  i believe you have the, there are the tryptamines and then the phenethylamines i believe it is but we don t have to get into all that partially because i ll just embarrass myself  but coming back to the default mode network which i think is worth returning to for a second  which listeners might recall is this collection of different parts of the brain that appear to be active when you are doing nothing  what is doing nothing mean? and this was discovered i believe in part when scientists were doing calibrations within fmri machines  they said,  all right, just do nothing, we want to get a baseline  ''peter attia  so this is the part of the brain that keeps lighting up  yeah, what the hell is going on? and it appears to be highly activated when people are engaging in any type of self referential thinking  i, how does it affect? not only think about fear but what makes you fear? what makes you fearful? okay, boom  and then default mode network seems to light up  any type of temporal projection  in other words, thinking about the past, thinking about the future seems to also light this up  and pollen does a great job of digging into this in the book and a number of people have written about this and in very eloquent terms  robyn cahar harris of the uk is one of them but to just pose a question that i think is something that s being explored currently, if say anxiety is being stuck in the future and being depressed is being stuck in the past, what happens if you re able to temporarily suspend or deactivate that system to some extent? and to give yourself that witness perspective so you look at yourself without being yourself ''the implication if many of these psychedelic compounds are able to achieve that is an even tom insel who i think is the former head of the national institute on or of mental health and imh, if you look at ocd, you look at different types of depression, different types of anxiety and so on, these are nice, these are very cleanly separated out in some type of, what is the term for this? desk reference that people use for  ''peter attia  dsm?''tim ferriss  dsm  in the dsm  but they may all be slightly different species of the same thing  which is why something like psilocybin appears to be lsd very similar story, mescaline probably very similar story in high enough doses can be used for anything that appears to involve obsessive thought patterns or behaviors  that includes alcoholism, it includes smoking, it includes opioid addiction and there are studies that are seeking funding right now i know at johns hopkins related to opioid addiction through the lens of psilocybin treatment which i m very, very interested in  eating disorders like anorexia  these may in fact be very interrelated phenomena and conditions ''so you mentioned a few that are lsd i think is off the table not for scientific reasons but for political reasons  it s just too loaded  there s just too much baggage  let us not forget that the media plays a very large role in how politics responds to things  in today s day and age i do not have a high level confidence that lsd since it was once painted as the villain is not, it s too seductive i think in a clickbait world to not fall into the same bear trap in a way ''so psilocybin, then you have mdma which is thought by, referred to as some people as an actogen or empathogen  this is not probably not scientifically too granularly accurate but it appears to tone down, that s not a scientific term  but tone down the amygdala and fear response that we have to say recalling or reliving traumatic events and it allows us to, people say with ptsd who have seen their friends  heads blown off or had to blow other peoples  heads off, whatever it might be, people who have been raped et cetera, to in some sense clean up a very messy experience that did a lot of damage  and to help people to heal themselves in nonverbal ways  this is really key  it s very hard for many people to talk their way out of something they didn t talk their way into ''peter attia  that s so well said  you said in one sentence what i tried to say in 20 sentences a while ago about the experiences that can cause pain can be so jarring that it should be at least acknowledged or considered that equally jarring chemical experiences might be necessary to put that new powder on the slope  definitely  so you have mdma  mdma i ll be honest, i was biased in some ways against mdma for a long time because a, i didn t have much personal experience with anything chemically related to mdma  i had a fear associated with it because of research which i think has since been largely debunked in terms of risks for people who are predisposed to depression for instance  it was also at one point viewed as and is still used recreational as a party drug  and i ve really been swayed to the other side  i m very bullish on mdma as a therapy  i think that is extremely, it s an extremely powerful and flexible tool that does not entail the type of perceptual distortion that some these psychedelics do  which is not to say i am not bullish on psychedelics, i am  but it requires much more sophisticated training to administer  so mdma  iboga and ibogaine ''peter attia  going back to mdma, i do think it is important to point out if anybody s listening to this thinking well of all of these compounds, mdma s pretty easy to get and you can get it packaged in other things and it s ecstasy et cetera  but this goes back to intent setting and integration  i really do not, i am not convinced that just taking mdma going to a party is somehow going to unwind any of these problems  i would go further than that and i would bet against it  if someone gave me a 100 grand and they said,  all right, this person is going to take mdma, go to a party 10 times, what is the likelihood that it s going to fix x longstanding problem?  i d go a  100,000, every single dollar against  i would short it  and i know people in fact who have used mdma recreationally and then used it in supervised settings and it is as if they are taking a different drug ''peter attia  yeah, that just can t be overstated  and i m not just saying that  cause i m a doctor and i m supposed to say something responsible  i mean that regardless  and that for me is the urgency around this stuff  i think about myself frankly but i think about my patients and i think about a lot of my patients that would benefit from these things that i ve experienced or even things that i haven t experienced that i ve seen people experience and i ve never had such a sense of urgency around this  prior to this the most urgency i ever had was waiting for pcsk 9 inhibitors to come on the market when i read that first paper in the new england journal of medicine about 12 years ago on the discovery of this type of, these individuals who had missense mutations in that enzyme  it lowered their ldl significantly  but boy the anxiety, anxiety might be the wrong word but the anticipation i had for that class of drugs which anybody listening to this is probably falling asleep thinking, that s you re an interesting guy if that s what was keeping you up at night waiting for that drug ''but this takes it to another level which is almost nobody i know has not been traumatized on some level  it doesn t always have to be something that is so obvious  so we ve all been traumatized  we ve all sort of been hurt  we re all dealing with these things and yet i feel how quickly can these things go through this regulatory pathway to get into the hands of people who would know how to administer them? i certainly wouldn t  even if these things were legal today that s only half the battle  it s can you create enough practitioners that know how to select the right patients and how to apply the treatment   cause this is in many ways harder than any other treatments we have today ''people talk today about the importance of combining psychotherapy with antidepressants but that s really the tip of the iceberg compared to this stuff  and it s also tricky from a commercial standpoint in so much as part of the reason these compounds haven t been picked up like a football and run to the end zone by big pharma is that many of these studies only involve two or three sessions with psilocybin  a naturally occurring molecule  in these cases it s synthesized but there is a lot more money to be made in something that you can charge an arm and a leg for that you have to take on a daily basis or an every other basis indefinitely as opposed to two or three times with some pre work and post work with durable effects in many cases that that s financially an unattractive model to many people  and i think it s a mistake  there are some for profit companies out there, i should say startups who are going after this  and i ll be very disappointed if they try to make their money on the molecule by blocking other people from doing research or manufacturing and good manufacturing in gmp facilities and so on  rather i think they should make their money on the services, on the therapy  that s maybe a separate discussion ''peter attia  now why has ibogaine taken the longest track? and why is that still the one that seems to have gained the least traction for testing in the united states? i ve spoken to a number of people, philanthropists who are really interesting in this opioid addiction problem and yet they are understandably not interested in funding research outside of the united states and basically their view is, until the dea and the fda allow for a similar pathway we re not interested in funding this and i worry that there s a bit of stalemate there  is this thawing?''tim ferriss  i don t think it is yet to thaw  there are some researchers and i m blanking on names i apologize  but there are a number of researchers who are doing very good work looking at ibogaine and have been studying it  iboga and ibogaine in the united states  part of what makes ibogaine tricky if on one end of the spectrum you have mdma which again i don t consider a classical psychedelic but as a tool that can be applied to some of the same conditions  what makes mdma attractive is general low toxicity, relative ease of administration, short duration if we re looking at i want say four to six hours let s say  maybe a little bit longer, four to eight hours  ibogaine falls on the opposite end of the spectrum ''now before we get to put that on the opposite end of the spectrum, i should say i know people very directly who had family members who were heroin addicts and say prostituting themselves, on death s door  if they weren t going to die from an overdose, they might die from getting shot in the street  and in a case like that where nothing else has worked including some, say alternatives like methadone, i ve seen kids arriving and it has worked ''peter attia  don t the practitioners of this offer that at one year the recidivism is only 20 ?''tim ferriss  i don t know the exact numbers but that s given what else i ve seen with these compounds it wouldn t, i don t find that unbelievable ''peter attia  if i m recalling that s only with two weeks of intervention  now these are people that are put into a very heavily supervised detox environment where the iboga and the ibogaine itself are administered over a one week period outside of the pre and post integration so i think the entire therapy if i recall is about six weeks  there are many different formats  and i know people who have been involved with running some of these clinics  certainly there are people like gabor mate who have looked at opioid addiction very closely but ended up as i understand at least looking at ayahuasca and others for helping people who are addicted to opiates  ibogaine is very, it s unlike some of the others such as psilocybin in that it acts on a whole slew of different receptors and let s discuss what puts it on the opposite end  yes, it can have these seemingly miraculous effects on opiate addiction  and part of the reason for that experientially is i understand it and i ve never gone for a full ride ibogaine or iboga psychedelic experience and i have no desire to  it is very unpleasant  it is very long  it can last as i understand it and people can feel free to correct me but 24 to 36 hours  that is a long time ''many people experience a full review of their lives and a controlled death experience whereby they get to see from the beginning of life almost like a slideshow  the decisions they ve made  how they ve hurt themselves  the other people they ve hurt  how their addiction has affected things  and what gabor mate would, how he might frame it is instead of asking why the addiction? ask, why the pain? and the addiction is often a response almost inevitably but often a response, i ll say often, to some type of trauma or pain  and if you don t address that in some fashion, allow people to reintegrate that somehow, the likelihood of recidivism very, very high  so just from a phenomenological perspective which is fancy way of saying subjective experiential standpoint, many people report that ''biochemically and there are people who are looking at for instance using a metabolite of ibogaine, noribogaine, which may mitigate some of the risks and this is part of the reason ibogaine hasn t taken ''peter attia  and the risk, i think we ve stated explicitly  cardiac risk ''peter attia  cardiac arrhythmias  people have and can die of cardiac events in using ibogaine  i don t know the specifics but i believe you can screen for this in a number of different ways to minimize the risk and then certainly you can monitor in ways having other types of more conventional pharmaceuticals on hand in the case there is some indicator of a pending cardiac event or cardiac event itself  that s one of the major risks  it is one of the more potentially dangerous psychedelics  it almost certainly is compared at least to say lsd or psilocybin for which i don t believe there is a known ld50, meaning well you can explain this better than i can ''peter attia  the ld50 being the dose at which 50  of a population would receive a lethal dose  exactly  biochemically what i was going to say, putting all that stuff aside for a moment, what s so odd about this and i m not an opiate specialist but i ve had family members die from opiate overdoses, i don t even know if i ve told you about this  relatively recently  and my best friend growing up on long island also died of a fentanyl overdose  so i have first hand experience with the pain of losing loved ones to this epidemic  it appears that many people can come out of these ibogaine treatments with close to no physical withdrawal symptoms and i don t know how that works  i really don t  but it does seem to be certainly one of the constituent pieces of this experience that lead to the success rate that many people are reporting ''peter attia  which is really interesting because it s true that opiate withdrawal is not physiologically harmful the way alcohol withdrawal is so delirium tremens, these dts that people get when they withdraw from alcohol will be fatal  so you actually have to manage these people with benzodiazepines and other medications as you taper someone off  you don t have to do that with opiates but the withdrawal is nevertheless psychologically devastating  that s interesting that you could mitigate that ''i ve read accounts where people talk very similarly about ibogaine the way you described or the way, i don t know if it was you or if it was michael pollan on the podcast talking about the smoker, i think it was michael pollan talking about the smoker who says,  you know my lungs are just too beautiful to be insulted with this stuff  and i realize that   and as silly as that might sound to someone listening to it, that experience if profound enough, can have a life changing event that is durable  the key is the durability ''and similarly i ve read these accounts of people who have been completely addicted to narcotics  the account i m thinking of in particular was someone using heroin  and they came away from this thinking, i could never stick that needle in my arm again  i could never do that to myself again because i now saw this connection i have to a plant and or another person and or another organism  again i know that i realize when i say that it sounds really silly  it takes us or brings us full circle in sense also back to the beginning when i said that you shouldn t and you don t have to go through life simply tolerating yourself at best  because there are a 1,000 things that could follow because  but in part if you don t have any regard for yourself, if you think you re worthless or if you think you re fatally flawed, if you think you re a fuck up, if you think you can t get anything right or you just don t have some intrinsic love for yourself  you don t see any beauty in yourself, why wouldn t you be addicted? why wouldn t you stick that needle in your arm? why wouldn t you smoke pot five times a day and tune out? why wouldn t, not to say there aren t applications of cannabis, don t freak out people out there  it s an interesting space, we don t have time to get into it right now ''but there are so many ways you can numb or damage yourself which is a in some ways a logical coping mechanism if you have a low regard for yourself  but when you sense an interconnectedness and you suddenly have empathy not just for other people like we ve felt through our experiences but an empathy for yourself  you look back at the 10 year old peter, or the 10 year old tim and i m just like jesus christ, fucking poor kid  i can sit with that feeling and actually identify with that kid and forgive that kid and assure that kid everything s going to be all right  it s right now in words through this microphone probably not going to have the impact that i would hope it to have but for people to feel that as if you are in the same room with that younger version of yourself, can be transformative beyond anything that i could convey right now ''when you have an experience like that as ludicrous as it might sound, the idea of injecting some type of numbing agent into your body just become inconceivable  in the same way that it would be inconceivable as you mentioned earlier, how you treat yourself is ultimately how you would treat others  well would you inject your son with that to numb his experience of life? of course not ''peter attia  yeah, that was just one of the most powerful experiences i ever had when i really finally accepted all of the issues i needed to accept and go into therapy was something they made me do which was carry around a picture of me at a certain age before certain things had happened that were pivotal in sort of shaping both the positive and negative aspects of my personality  and the idea was, and again it just works out that way, it worked out that way for me that my oldest son is at about that age and just for what it s worth, looks like me  so it became a very easy way to look at him and say,  well that was me   and it turns out that that was the bridge to understanding  it s actually if you re a parent, what parent can t find empathy for their child? and that s like this stepping stone ''and so to think that these agents can do that  because maybe not everybody has that luxury of having a child or having a child that looks like them at the same age when they were traumatized or something like that  it s very powerful and it just, i guess it s there are many problems to which i really honestly have no, not even the foggiest clue how to go about solving them from a practical standpoint  like talk about climate change  we could talk about climate change all day long and we could certainly wax philosophically on lots of regulatory things that could be done to mitigate it but you start to realize very quickly that politically these things become challenging and you have all sorts of different economies around the world and they d all have to be in lock step  and you sort of not to be dismissive of these things or say we shouldn t work very hard at solving these but the solution space isn t that clear to me ''and yet when you see a problem that in my mind is the single most important problem that s plaguing our civilization, i know that s a big statement  that s a super big statement  and i realize it s also probably na ve when you consider that there are many other problems going on  but unhappiness is at the root of more pain i would suspect than any ailment that falls in the quote unquote physical body  and to think that we have compounds that could play such an important role that are really facing challenges in getting approved, i just find that really frustrating  it s frustrating and it has been frustrating for people  like for instance rick doblin who heads up maps ''peter attia  he s been at it since 1986  1986 ''peter attia  which is just amazing  and probably beforehand if you take into account i believe that s when maps was officially formed, if i m not getting my facts wrong ''when maps was officially formed, if i m not getting my facts wrong, and we re at a very exciting time now  mdma s being expedited  psilocybin is certainly on its way  for people who are interested in learning more about this, i think maps org is a fantastic place to look  in fact, one of the areas where maps could use support, as i understand it, is in taking their approach to legitimizing mdma use therapeutically in the us to europe  there will be steps they ll take with the ema, i think it is, which is the fda equivalent in the eu for, hopefully, facilitating mdma use in europe ''that s certainly if you re looking to become involved with exploring and potentially supporting this as i am, that is one clear and present need and we re also at a very exciting point because psilocybin is one example which has a lot of good research to support and there s a lot more being done at places like hopkins and nyu and many other places now ''may have, and this remains to be studied, but it s plausible that it could have profound applications to opioid addiction, for instance  this comes back also to the mccormick story with birth control because the   i don t recall what the first compound was that was fda approved, but it wasn t approved for birth control  i think it was approved for menstrual disorders ''peter attia  that s right  that is the thin end of the wedge was women whose menstrual cycles were unusually heavy or uncomfortable were the first approval  exactly ''peter attia  that s the most important step is it s much easier to use something off label once it s been approved than to get something approved  you pick the right indication  that s what s also impressed me about these organizations is just the strategic thought they ve put into this which is understanding a road map that is interested in the least resistance  right, because to   what does it take to reschedule something? if you want to take it from the same classes of heroin and put it into a class where it can be prescribed with proper medical supervision, you need to   one of the approaches like cocaine and the nasal anesthetic demonstrate one clear medical application and if that is depression in terminal cancer patients, that is a legitimate medical application and then that entire train can get in motion ''peter attia  that s one nice thing about where the dea and the fda fall out is for the most part, there s a sense that,  look, once we, as these agencies, done our job in scheduling something, we re going to put faith in the practitioner to use his or her judgment as to how much latitude to grant around the application   i ll also mention one thing just in case we have regulators or lawmakers, policy makers, people within the fda or dea who are listening, and that is read pollan s book, check out pollan s book and immerse yourself in this fascinating area of research and i ll give, like a lot of people, you just don t have the bandwidth to dedicate a lot of time to this, something that pollan has referred to on a number of different occasions and that is the addictive potential ''what is the addictive potential of these compounds for looking at, let s say, psilocybin specifically? we could use other examples, but if you take a rat, put it in a cage and you give it one dispenser, a little lever that they can push to dispense food and another dispenser with cocaine, that it can use to dispense cocaine, it will consume cocaine to the exclusion of food until it dies in many cases ''if you do that with food and, say, psilocybin and it gets delivered a whopping dose of psilocybin, it will press that lever once, and then the rat s like,  okay, that was enough,  and it goes to the food  rather than having high addictive potential, many of these compounds have anti, as we ve already discussed, anti addictive potential  my god, it is terrifying when i look at where i grew up on long island and you look at the obvious   putting aside all of the stuff that i don t see or hear about, but the obvious among people i grew up with, among my friends who have died of overdoses, family members who have died of overdoses, these are, in some cases, educated people in some cases not ''they were using prescription medications  these are widely distributed, easily prescribed medications that have demonstrated incredible abusive potential  to think that we have these molecules that can be produced at relatively low cost at scale that are not just non addictive, but anti addictive, really provides some hope that we can counteract some of these incredible epidemics  i mean, you might have been the person who told me this  it could have been someone else, but was it last year that opioid deaths exceeded automotive accidents?''peter attia  yeah, for   it used to be that automotive accident was the leading cause of death for people up to a certain age and i believe the age is 40 and now, opioid overdose has offset that  this isn t an isolated issue anymore  for me, i think the rate limiting step is actually going to be training the clinicians to administer these things  i think that s going to become the bottleneck and that s why i hope that   we have friends who are psychiatrists, psychologists who have become very interested in this and that, to me, is really heartwarming because they re actually going to be among the people who need to lead the charge on this  there are groups thinking about this  certainly both maps and other organizations that involve psilocybin are thinking about this, people who have come to the table to provide some funding like myself and for instance the bronner family, of  dr   bronner soap and others, certainly there are technologists who have come to the table many of them have done so anonymously are very well aware that having these compounds legalized for supervised use is step one and that there will be a very real need for training clinicians ''the wheels are already in motion with prototyping some of this  there s a group called  ciis,  out in california, which is prototyping some training protocols for therapists who are licensed in various ways already, so that when these compound are available through prescription that there are trained clinicians who can administer, so we ll see ''i m very optimistic, but this is where i would be applying a lot of my focus and these problems do not discriminate  these problems, these addictions, depression, anxiety that people experience on a daily basis don t care what color you are, don t care what gender you are, don t care how much or how little money you have ''i mean, given how publicly i ve talked about, for instance, the content of the ted talk that i put out there on the depression, i ve had people come out of the woodwork from my listenership, my readership, some of the wealthiest people in the world who suffer from debilitating depression, whose kids are addicted to heroin  on the opposite end of the spectrum, people who listen to the podcast who are just scraping by, same set of issues, debilitating and  ''in the last few years, i ve developed a real sense of optimism about myself and my life quite frankly  number one as a starting plan, which i think is a starting plan, before you try to save the world, it s a good idea to try to save yourself and i have come away completely convinced that many of these stories i told myself, which were crippling, were unnecessary and that they can be wiped and you can write new stories, new narratives for yourself  we talked about meditation  there s a book you introduced me to that i think we should certainly mention also ''peter attia  it s the solve for happy?''tim ferriss  solve for happy  can you talk about this?''peter attia  yeah  rick gerson, who is a mutual friend and you actually introduced me to rick probably about five years ago, he gave me a copy of this book and it was one of those things that just sort of sat there for, i don t know, six months and it was just in the queue but i didn t really appreciate why i ought to read it as soon as it was given to me  something in the midst of a crisis sort of brought it to my attention a little more quickly and i just devoured it and so if the terrence real book, i don t want to talk about i, he s now jumped into the number one spot of books i ve gifted most, solve for happy is probably in the number two spot and  mo gawdat  i m not sure if i m pronouncing that right, but m o, last name, g a w d a t ''peter attia  that s sort of pushed mistakes were made (but not by me) into the now number three spot, just ahead probably of surely you re joking, mr  feynman! it s weird, isn t it? it says something about us, the books we like to give people, doesn t it?''you thanked michael pollan at the end of your interview or maybe it was somewhere in the midst of it, but i thought it was at the end of the interview for writing the book that he did because you said it was the book you wanted to read and that you wish you could have written, but you re no slouch yourself when it comes to writing books ''is there anything that if michael hadn t had done that and you would have been writing that book in addition to all the stuff we ve talked about today, is there anything else that you would have included in that book that wasn t included? he s a tough act to follow  very tough act to follow and i m so pleased that he wrote the book because i have been very clearly biased in the sense that i am a   i ve seen the power of his compounds first hand and i m not shy about, as we ve seen in this conversation, putting myself clearly on the side of support ''i don t think they should be available at every 7 eleven  some people think every drug should just be available for anyone who wants to pick them up at any time  i disagree with that position completely, but i am nonetheless exceptionally bullish on the scientific research and ultimately, the rescheduling and widening of making these compounds available to people through qualified professionals and supervision ''michael has such a pedigree and is so widely respected as a, and i don t think he would mind me saying this, a highly skeptical investigative journalist that i couldn t be happier that he published his book before anything that i might write on the subject ''if i were to write a book about or including, i should say, a discussion of psychedelics, it would differ along the lines of pollan s and my writing styles, meaning pollan is so brilliant at taking the history and science and characters in a given field and weaving it into a first person narrative of his exploration of all of those things, much like john mcphee  i don t want to digress, he s also a hero of mine, but they re both so good at that  i would never try to out pollan pollan, i ll get my face ripped off  my book would just be a poor, poor, poor imitation of something that he would do masterfully ''peter attia  as i m writing a book now, sorry to interrupt, it makes it that much more apparent to me when i read good books, how much i suck and i m not saying that in a   that s not a negative self talk, although it sounds like it, it s just the reality of it  it s like, look, i mean, these people are great for a reason and it s exactly what you said, it s like the best books are not lecturing you, they re bringing you on a journey and when they can do that in really complicated topics and bring you along, and also interweave history non linearly  it s amazing, but i would say, just to give you a smooch on the forehead, that much like the best meditation approach or app or teacher in the world for me may very likely drive you nuts and is not the right person for you, that stylistically, some writers, some books will speak to you or grab your attention in an otherwise overflowing workload  and some won t  and that differs person to person ''rather than trying to out pollan pollan or out mcphee mcphee for god s sake, that would be a losing attempt  i ve realized that i m not   what i enjoy doing is providing firsthand accounts of my self experimentation followed by prescriptive recommendations that aren t intended to work for everybody, but that serves as more of a  choose your adventure  buffet of options that i have vetted to at least work on myself and a number of close friends who span some different genders, different age groups and so on ''that s what i did with the 4 hour body, that s what i ve done with all these different books, so if i were to write a book including psychedelics, it would likely include experiments with other modalities, other vehicles, other tools that also produce not minutely noticeable, but profound changes in consciousness, which is really the stage upon which everything happens, right? in doing so, provide you with an opportunity to rewrite the story of your life or to gain perspectives that are otherwise inaccessible and that might include sensory deprivation tanks, it might include neurofeedback, it might include other types of non psychedelic pharmaceuticals  it might include ''peter attia  ketamine, for example  we didn t get into that  that would have taken a while, but  ketamine, for instance ''ketamine is a whole separate kettle of fish  i think my book would be more diffuse in that sense, thematically connected but with independent module or chapters that include some likely extreme experiment that i conduct on myself and then report back and say,  guess what? i pushed the envelope and went way too far so you don t have to  let s dial that back 80  and here s something you can try that i think has an acceptable risk benefit profile   that s probably the book that i would write ''peter attia  speaking of your book, i don t know if i told you this story  i think i did, but if not, it s worth retelling  totally unrelated it is, but it just made me think of it  maybe a year ago or so, i m in the airport and i just remember my flight was delayed and i was sort of   a friend who i don t talk to that often, maybe once a year, he called me and he s like,  dude, i just read about you in a book today   i think i know where you re going ''peter attia  i was like,  really? what do you mean?  he s like,  yeah, yeah  you re in this book  it s called biggest tools  i was like,  what?  he goes,  yeah, yeah, yeah  there s a chapter on you in this book   i mean,  do you mean tools of titans? he s like,  yeah, yeah, yeah  that s it, that s it   he just didn t even   he s israeli and he has an accent so it s like   you could tell that the expression  biggest tools  didn t mean to him what it meant to me  i just thought that was the funniest thing, so to this day, i feel proud to be one of the biggest tools  well, that would be maybe the alternate title of the podcast that you and i have joked about which is  dumb things that smart people do   that s a separate conversation, but there s so many ridiculous habits and obsessions that anyone who could be considered smart has if you have not seen it already, just   where should people find egg boxing?''peter attia  we ll link to it, but there s a   it s got its own facebook page at this point  it s hilarious  that ll be a teaser ''peter attia  i do have one final question that s not on the topic at all of what we ve discussed, but given that we have now between the two of us in the past two and a half hours drank, i want to say 20 topo chicos, my bladder right now is probably at its maximum capacity  i think pretty soon i m going to develop hydronephrosis so we re going to have to bring this thing to a close ''one of the questions i get asked all the time is people say,  you re such good friends with tim  does he still do x? does he still do y? he wrote about this  he talked about this  i wonder does he still do it,  and so i was thinking for the person out there who s sort of wondering how has tim evolved, when you think of all the things you have written about, when you think about all the lessons you have codified for people, what are the three, four, maybe five things that you have written about in some of your books that still consistently shape how you have continued to optimize your trajectory?''tim ferriss  the three to five things that i would say i return to most reliably are perhaps unsexy to some people, but one would be some type of hinging exercise movement  i notice that problems crop up when these are omitted for any extended period of time  by hinging movement or hip hinging movement, i mean some type of deadlift or kettlebell swing, two handed kettlebell swing  very, very simple to incorporate that into an exercise program  i do not believe unless you have some type of competitive agenda that you need to do these more than once a week  you can certainly do them twice a week for extra credit, but kettlebell swings or deadlifts once a week prevent a whole host of issues and improve a whole host of performance factors  that would be one ''number two would be fasting and entering a state of ketosis for at least one week, at least once a quarter  in conversations with peter, in conversations with dom d agostino, a mutual friend, very impressive, not just published researcher and scientist but also athlete himself, the intermittent use of autophagy and entering this state of fasting and ketosis seems to me to deliver a host of potential benefits with very minimal downside ''i also like just the pure estheticism of the practice, so we have the hinging movement, like a deadlift or kettlebell, we have fasting plus ketosis for an extended period, at least once a quarter  i just actually finished my latest segment about a month ago ''number three would be some type of meditative practice first thing in the morning  i m also asked constantly one of the question that i ask sometimes which is,  what advice would you give your 20 year old self? what advice would you give your 30 year old self?  it would be meditate 10 to 20 minutes first thing in the morning  don t do it after you check your email and do a, b and c because you re going to fail 50  of the time  you just will not go back to it ''wake up, right now for instance, i have a foldable chair that goes on the floor  i believe it s called a  backjack  or  jackback,  something along those lines, used quite often in meditation centers, right on the floor in front of my bed that faces out a window looking at a bunch of beautiful trees and i get out of bed, throw some water on my face, sit down and meditate ''i would say that s number three  absolutely some type of non reactivity training for 10 to 20 minutes or put in another way, non reactivity rehearsal, which is another reason why meditation sessions where you feel entirely scattered and you only return to the breath a few times, feel like a waste of time, but they are absolutely not a waste of time is that there are going to be periods throughout your day on many days when life is going to just roundhouse kick you in the face over and over again and you are going to be in that scattered state  it is good to rehearse mindfulness in that scattered state, which is exactly what you re doing ''all right, so we have the hip hinging movement at least once a week exercise wise, ketosis fasting, meditation would be three  number four would be the importance of group ritual and this is something that very often falls by the wayside that i forget because i ve so often retreated into myself whenever i felt pain or depression or anxiety  i don t want to impose that on anyone else and i feel like i should be able to figure it out on my own and just climb back into the cave that is my brain ''this very often results in isolation where i m just by myself, even if i m surrounded by other people, by myself sitting in a coffee shop by myself in my own head  group dinners at least once or twice a week  cooking, i have found, and this was not always the case for people interested, you can check out the 4 hour chef for all the reasons why i find this so incredibly therapeutic, but don t have to cook  i just happened to find it adds another level of decompression, but group meals at least once or twice a week would be number four ''then if i had to pick a number five, i would say   i m not going to use the psychedelics because we ve been talking about this entire conversation  if you feel like you re having trouble making yourself happy, try to make someone else happy  i think that that is the workaround that very often then improves your own state ''it s like if you re feeling just awful or depressed or in a funk, go get a coffee and pay for the person behind you  just exercise some of those random acts of kindness, think about someone who has helped you and called them and leave them a voicemail or get them on the phone to thank them for how they ve helped you and closely related to that that ties back into the meditative practice is if the  me, me, me  practice focusing on your breath, focusing on your thoughts, focusing on  your, your, your, your, me, me, me, me,  it is maybe exacerbating some of your problems and you feel like you re having trouble escaping your own head ''take a look at metta meditation, m e t t a, also known as  loving kindness meditation  and i have found that to just be powerful beyond belief  i didn t think it would do anything  i found that kind of cheesy, i thought it was kind of cliched ''i wrote about this a bit barring from the teaching of someone named chade meng tan, who was an early engineer at google and created a class called  search inside yourself,  which was hugely oversubscribed by employees at google  i think it had some insane waiting list and this was one of the techniques he recommended, so loving kindness, it s hyphenated, loving kindness meditation which jack kornfield has some fantastic examples of  jack kornfield, k o r n field and loving kindness meditation also known as metta, m e t t a, meditation ''there have been multiple reports  i ve certainly experienced this myself, but by doing metta meditation, say, at night before going to bed, do that for a few days and you might have the most at peace week you have experienced in years  it s really something else  it s just worth experimenting with  i would say those are my five, at least the five that come to mind right now that i would feel very comfortable defending and backing ''peter attia  well, tim, that s super helpful because we manage to somehow figure a way to spend so much time together that when you say those things, i m like,  yeah, of course, that s just what you re always doing   i think it s great for people who are listening to this who don t get to interact with you frequently to get that little update on stuff ''you ve been incredibly generous with your time, but what people probably don t realize is how generous you ve been with your time off this podcast including sending me the links to which pieces of equipment to buy for the recordings and sitting down with me and giving me not just the 101, but the full course on,  look, do this, don t do that  waste time and energy on this, don t waste time and energy on that  ''i really want to thank you  i can t imagine having anybody else be the number one episode of this podcast, and i do hope that this podcast continues beyond the initial 12 or 13, but even if it doesn t, this will have been incredibly worthwhile and thank you again for your hospitality this weekend in particular ''i remember i put out something on instagram the other day about what was the over, under on how many topo chicos i could drink in a weekend and i think i set it at 15 or 16, but we have blown through that so much  i can t imagine  anyone who s listening to this who doesn t know what we re talking about, we re talking about a sort of bottled water, it s in a glass bottle and it s a carbonated water, but anybody who s tried it will agree it s not like a perrier, there s something different  little touch of magic sodium to keep you coming back for more among other things ''peter attia  anyway, tim, i can t thank you enough for taking the time to be on a little rinky dink podcast at this point, but anyway, it s been wonderful  my pleasure, man  i expect to see you right up there with our mutual friend jocko, who you introduced me to, so thank you for helping to unleash jocko on the internet  ever since our episodes on my

137,145,145: Cal Fussman ,"   hello boys and girls  this is tim ferriss  welcome to another episode of the tim ferriss show, where it is my job to deconstruct world class performers of various types from all fields including entertainment, military, academia, research, and otherwise, sports, etc  this episode is a very special one and features a verbal jedi who never really gets interviewed himself, cal fussman  you may not recognize that name, but that is going to change  cal fussman, at cal fussman, c a l f u s s m a n on the twitters, is a new york times best selling author and writer at large for esquire magazine, where he s best known for being a primary writer of the  what i learned  feature  now, what i learned, what is this? well, it is comprised of interviews with icons that you ll recognize  the austin chronicle described cal s interviewing skills as quote peerless, end quote and i would have to agree with that  i've met a great many writers and interviewers and cal is just hands and heads above everyone else  i'm not sure if that makes nay sense  i've had quite a bit of wine  it is about 1 in the morning in new york city in the land of chaos, and that sounds like the right expression to use  in any case, cal has transformed oral history into an art form, conducting probing interviews with icons who ve shaped the last 50 years of world history, including mikhail gorbachev, jimmy carter, ted kennedy, jeff bezos, richard branson, jack welch, robert de niro, clint eastwood, al pacino, george clooney, leo dicaprio, tom hanks, bruce springsteen, dr  drew, quincy jones, woody allen, barbara walters, pel , yao ming, serena williams, john wood and mohammed ali and countless others  born in brooklyn, and this is the part where the bio sounds unbelievable, and as far as i can tell, it s totally true  here we go  born in brooklyn, cal spent ten straight years traveling the world, swimming over 18 foot tiger sharks, rolling around with mountain gorillas in rwanda, and searching for gold in the amazon  he s also made himself a guinea pig  he s boxed against world  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    champion julio cesar chavez when he was undefeated and served as a sommelier atop the world trade center  he now lives with his wife, whom he met while on a quest to discover the world s most beautiful beach and has three children in los angeles, where he spends every morning eating breakfast with larry king  and that is, in fact, how i met cal for the first time was at this particular breakfast at a jewish deli with larry king, where larry eats honey nut cheerios and that is it  go figure  in any case, you guys have to check out cal  i really loved this conversation  he s been a mentor to me in this game of interviewing and asking questions, which is really about not just probing into the lives of others but thinking more clearly yourself  and cal is really the obi wan kenobi of this particular area of expertise  so i hope you enjoy  check him out  i want to help out cal  he is doing a lot of interesting stuff at expanding outside of writing  so be sure to check out his website, calfussman, c a l f u s s ma n dot com  say hello  on twitter as well,  and without further ado, as i always say after a long intro, please enjoy my conversation with cal fussman  tim ferriss   cal, welcome to the show   cal fussman   thank you  i have arrived   tim ferriss   you have arrived and i'm so excited to have you here because we ve gotten to know each other a bit over the last however many months  and it s been such a joy because as i've tried to delve into this craft of asking questions and crafting conversation, i've realized there s a lot to it  and i've been a fan of your work for so many years  the subtleties are just so powerful and i thought this time we could turn the tables and i could interrogate you in public  i love asking you questions about your process and you ve been so generous with your time in terms of reviewing some of my episodes, providing feedback  so first and foremost, thank you for your work and for all of the help   cal fussman   i m delighted  you re good  you re good   tim ferriss   i think i have a lot of room to improve  this is one of these episodes where i'm a little self conscious because i know that i have a very unusual memento like, sometimes non chronological  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    approach to interviews  and for that, i'll apologize in advance  but we can do a post game analysis afterwards  perhaps we could just start with something that we were discussing before we hit record  we were talking about the live event that was here in la at the troubadour  we were doing a bit of analysis, what went well, what didn t go as well as planned, and so on  i mentioned that, i suppose due to also some insecurities of a sort, that i try to, when i do these rare live events, if it s, say, two hours long i'll stay for an additional two or three hours and do q a or something like that  and you said that s straight out of quincy jones s book  i know this is an unusual place to start, but maybe you could just provide that anecdote because it seems like you have an endless trove of these types of anecdotes  but why quincy jones? cal fussman   quincy jones will go to a book signing and there will be long lines of people  he will not sign his name and, move them on, next  he will stop, ask everyone who they are, engage in a conversation and then write a personal note in his book to them  and the line may be around the block  he ll be there until 3 in the morning, keeping the people at barnes   noble open because he wants to make it a joyous experience for everybody  so bravo  you ve followed the master   tim ferriss   inadvertently  the story, of course, if we rewind the clock, begins at the beginning  where did you grow up? i actually am ashamed to know i don t know the childhood background  where did you grow up?  cal fussman   i'm born in brooklyn and moved to yonkers, new york, where i did second grade and third grade  that s where i had, when i think back on it, like a pivotal moment asking questions  because that time, second grade, was the time that i was sitting in miss jaffe s classroom, and she came into the room   she was out for some reason  when she came in, you could look at her and know something just happened that i don t know but it s different from anything i've ever seen before  this was november, 1963, and it was miss jaffee who told the class that president kennedy had been shot  and so we all got sent home, found out that he had died  and i really would love to see myself on videotape that night  because i knew, man, something is going on here  they explained to me that lyndon johnson was the vice president, and he was now to  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    become the new president  and i'm thinking, man, what must it be like to be that guy? what is he feeling? i know he probably wanted to be the president, but he couldn t be the president  and then he was the vice president, and now the president gets killed and he gets to be the president  so i picked up a piece of paper and a pencil, and i just wrote to lyndon johnson  tim ferriss   you wrote a letter to lyndon johnson?  cal fussman   i wrote a letter to lyndon johnson and said, what does it feel like? and about six months later, i got a letter back   tim ferriss   that s incredible   cal fussman   and it was from his personal secretary, juantia d  roberts, and the cool thing about it was the first sentence was  thank you for the friendly thought in writing  so i don t know what i wrote him but somehow i must have tried to make him feel comfortable that this question was coming  and then the second question was  in answer to your query  what that said was she was treating me like i was legit  i had just turned seven   tim ferriss   bonafide adult   cal fussman   exactly  and you know, when you did the interview with ed norton, he talked about having a mentor in high school who treated him like an adult   tim ferriss   that s right   cal fussman   and that is what that letter felt like to me  and only now, when people are starting to ask me questions, did this come to me  but that s when i realized that asking questions is kind of natural for me   tim ferriss   so that was in second grade?  cal fussman   second grade   tim ferriss   i have to ask  when you wrote the letter, something back to second grade  was it written on paper that had the dotted line in between the intact lines for the lower case letters? do you recall what kind of paper it was on?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    cal fussman   i don t know  it was probably on loose leaf paper, if i was making a guess  i was talking to the historian robert caro, who wrote volumes about lyndon johnson   tim ferriss   also wrote the power broker, am i right?  cal fussman   that s right   tim ferriss   incredible book   cal fussman   exactly  this guy has spent decades knowing everything about lyndon johnson as possible  and i'm telling him this story, and he s like getting goose bumps when i say juanita d  roberts  you got a letter from juanita d  roberts? he started asking me all these questions about the letter, and where it could be, and how i sent it  and i realized, as he was doing it, yeah, he was made to be a historian  nobody else in the world would have gotten that high over the words juanita d  roberts  but some people are just born with the proclivity to do certain things   tim ferriss   what do you think, even if it s god given talent, what gives you a gift for questions?  cal fussman   i think part of that has to do with the evolution as an interviewer, as a journalist  because as we talk it through, you ll see that i interviewed differently when i was, say, 18 than when i was 24, and differently in my 40s than i when i was 25  so it really is like a lifelong voyage of learning about questions and reactions  it was only when i started to think back on that first letter did i realize okay, this is   i guess it would sort of be like being a basketball player and you know that you re born with big hands  if i go up for a dunk, i can grip the ball with one hand  carmelo anthony can t  it s like a big secret  he can t get his hands around the basketball  he s great but some people are just born with big hands and some people don t have big hands  i'm only now starting to realize okay, i was kind of born to do this   tim ferriss   did your parents facilitate that and cultivate that in any way? or was it the nature more than nurture in the household?  cal fussman   it s a good question, and maybe they did in that my dad loved sports  i grew up in the 60s at a time where mohammed ali came  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    into play  he was my childhood hero  in some sense, that was the start of i t  because he was more than my hero just because he was the heavyweight champ of the world and he could dance and make sure nobody ever hit him  and then when he wanted to hit you, he could hit you 16 times before you even blinked  it was more than the fact that he could make predictions with poetry and make you always laugh  his actions made you ask questions  he would take his olympic gold medal and throw it in the ohio river, and it would make you wonder, hold it  how is it that a black guy can win a gold medal in australia and come back after representing his country and not be able to sit at a lunchroom counter at a woolworth s next to white people  he would defy the government and refuse draft induction, wouldn t go in the army  and basically say  hey, i ain t got nothing against no vietcong  and he would make you think  hey, what is going on over there in vietnam? so that was a huge, huge part of my childhood  tim ferriss   did you have any particular career aspirations? what did you want to be when you were a kid, say from second grade onward? were there any particular professions that you knew you wanted to go after?  cal fussman   two things  i wanted to see my face over a column in a big city newspaper, and i wanted to write a magazine story about mohammed ali   tim ferriss   wow, very prescient   cal fussman   no, i knew what i wanted to do  only later, after i'd done it so quickly, did i realize  oh, what am i gonna do now? which we can get to   tim ferriss   you mentioned 18 and 24, so two very specific ages  take me to, say, 18 and then 24 and contrast your two styles  but if you could tell us where you were at those two points, also   cal fussman   sure  when i grew up, i grew up thinking an interview was meet the press  i grew up thinking it was what happened in the locker room after a sporting event  so i knew in order to achieve my dreams, i needed to go to journalism school  i asked around and found out university of missouri had one of the best, so that s where i went  i learned to ask who, what, when, where, and why and went through the whole journalism cycle   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    this was also an interesting time  it was the time of watergate  so journalists were seen at the highest point that maybe they ve ever been  it was really cool to be a journalist  a journalist actually brought down the president when they caught him lying  so it was a great time and i went into sports  so basically after i graduated, four months after i graduated, i was sitting ringside when mohammed ali won the heavyweight championship for the third time  a year after that, if you lived in st  louis and you opened the post dispatch sports section, you saw my face over a column  and a year after that, i went to the big time, new york  an amazing magazine called inside sports got started up  tim ferriss   how old were you at the time?  cal fussman   i was 22 by then  basically, this magazine was really unique  it was set up in the day that sports illustrated was as big as it gets, and it was set up to compete with sports illustrated  and it brought in all these great writers  so i'd be going to the bar at night and sitting next to hunter thompson, the gonzo journalist who d be throwing back shots  the next morning i'd be getting up and going on a plane to pittsburg   tim ferriss   wait, hold on one second  you did shots with hunter s  thompson?  cal fussman   oh, yeah   tim ferriss   okay, we re going to come back to that  please continue   cal fussman   this magazine attracted all these writers  the guy who started it was a guy named john a  walsh, who went on to start sports center for espn  he had one of the most amazing things i'd ever seen at the time  i didn t really even know what a rolodex was  i walked into inside sports for the first time  it was a friday afternoon  i called him up and i said  hey, if i come into new york to work, i'm not asking you for a job, just make sure i don t starve  and he said  come on in! i showed up at the office at like 4 00, and there were two guys with a dolly stacked with beer  it was case after case of beer  i got in the elevator right behind the dolly  they hit the same floor number that i needed to go to, and they just rolled it out into the offices of inside sports  and i said, this is where i need to be  this magazine attracted guys like david halberstam, who is a pulitzer prize  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    winning writer, just the best of the best  basically, i got to sit next to all of them  i was only a kid  i was 22  every night everybody would go across the street to a bar called the cowboy  tony the bartender was behind the bar  at the time, i had no money so they would put out these little hors d oeuvres  that was where my dinner would be if the guys with expense accounts weren t going out later  tim ferriss   the mixed nuts and olives     cal fussman   that was dinner   tim ferriss   crappy maraschino cherries   cal fussman   but it was great because you re sitting next to frank deford, who was the big sports writer of his day  a guy named gary smith came to work there  he was a national magazine award winner for many, many years  and it was just a blast  it was the best time   tim ferriss   it sounds incredible   cal fussman   and then, like a lot of artistic successes, it was not a commercial success  and like a lot of startups, it went belly up   tim ferriss   sounds like the paris review and many, many others   cal fussman   there you go  so here i am in new york, and basically i've now achieved everything i'd set out to achieve when i was a kid  and i'm looking around saying, what am i gonna do now? where am i gonna go? i had no idea  because i knew if i took   inside sports was not a job, it was an experience  it was an event every evening  who s coming tonight? i didn t know what to do so i called up my mom and dad  and i said  you know, i think i'm going to take some time off and travel  and my mom, who s always really supportive, said  oh, cal, that s wonderful  and little did she know when i said it that i wasn t coming back for ten years  but i didn t know it, either  i just bought a ticket to go over to europe, left with a few guys, and that started a ten year odyssey of cal going around the world   tim ferriss   oh, god  let s hit pause for a second  i want to do some backtracking here  the first question, and i have not forgotten  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    about hunter s  thompson, but when you said   and p lease correct me if i'm getting this wrong but i don t need a job  i just don t want to starve  and he said come on in  why did he give you such a warm welcome? cal fussman   he had actually reached out to me  and again, this went back to university of missouri journalism  that s where he had gone to school  i found all through my travels this school and its network, i was always linked to them in some way  and you knew who was really good from that school  everybody knew it  so if i found out that somebody was doing really good work, and they were an editor and i knew they went to the university of missouri, it s an easy phone call for me to make  it s interesting because i didn t have to make those calls often because there was like a nexus of people who bumped into people and you were ferreted to the right place  so when inside sports folded, ultimately one of the editors there got the job at the washington post sunday magazine  but when i was traveling around the world, i didn t really write   tim ferriss   i have so many questions about the travel  the preceding contrast, so if we looked at, say, how you interviewed and asked questions when you were at the tail end of your first professional gig, and then at the tail end of inside sports  what changed?  cal fussman   nothing really changed there  basically, the idea was to get the information you needed for a story, to fill out a story  back in that day, i know it s hard for sports writers to believe it because they ask me to speak at colleges in front of journalism schools and in the  70s, women s sports got no coverage at all  they would beg you to go to their games, go into their locker rooms, whatever you wanted  i was talking at the university of nebraska journalism school  they can t even interview women s volleyball players in a very relaxed fashion  they have to go through the sports information office, and they won t be able to ask personal questions  so it s a completely different time  when i would go out to do a story, i might spend a week, two weeks with somebody  and now, that just doesn t happen because of all the proliferation of the media and everybody s asking for that time so it s pretty much shut down  so basically you got to hang with people  the questions basically filled out the story  but for me, it was very different than the next stage because that first stage was very who, what, where, when,  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and why and what might have been underneath  what was your childhood like  and it filled out a sports story  the next step that started when i was about 23 or 24 was completely different  tim ferriss   and that was, just to place it in the timeline, that was before you left?  cal fussman   no, this was the moment i left  inside sports shut down and there was actually like a run on the bank to go over, people to get their last checks   tim ferriss   sounds pretty common   cal fussman   right after that was when i decided to start traveling  and that s where interviewing changed for me forever   tim ferriss   two quick questions before we get there  first is what was it like doing shots and having drinks with hunter s  thompson?  cal fussman   it was fantastic  he was a very funny guy, and it was all anecdotes  there were a bunch of people in the bar, everybody was telling stories  it was completely natural  what s kind of interesting about my memory of it is later on, i interviewed johnny depp, who played hunter thompson  and he just reached into this vegetable plate that was in front of the hotel   tim ferriss   are you talking about depp?  cal fussman   yeah, depp  and he pulled out a carrot and put it in his mouth the way hunter thompson would smoke those long cigarettes, and he became hunter s  thompson  it was wild  he said  yeah, it comes out in me every now and then  the thing about hunter s  thompson is you think about him almost as a caricature  but like at the bar, he was a regular guy just telling stories  i remember him telling stories about being a bowling writer in san juan, puerto rico  and we d be laughing about things like that  so it was very human  the conversation wasn t with the caricature of hunter thompson, it was with the guy   tim ferriss   when you went out to drink with the guys, hopefully with the expense accounts, what was your drink of choice? did you have a go to drink?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    cal fussman   back then, it was before i knew anything about wine  back then, it was guinness or a black and tan, or maybe a gin and tonic  those were the three things  you know, one time i remember   this is really crazy  you want to know why inside sports went out of business? they had one of the photographers who had worked with sports illustrated in the past  and so i was sent out on a story with this guy, and this guy was saying  oh, i gotta show you how to use an expense account  i can see you re a very young novice, here  and before he d do any work, he was straight to the bar  and i'm saying, are you sure? like maybe we should go out and do interviews  no, no, no  he starts to say  you know, i think we need to have some green chartreuse   tim ferriss   oh, lord   cal fussman   this guy must have knocked the bar bill  and his point was  look, this is how we do it at sports illustrated  like if you don t run up a bar bill like this, nobody's going to think you re big time   tim ferriss   sounds like fear and loathing in las vegas   cal fussman   it was a little like that  it was all like this day to day event  i was meeting the athletes that i grew up watching on tv, and talking to these sports writers  it was one of those times that comes around once in a life and then when it s gone, you can never really have it again because part of it is you re naivety making it so grand  and then it was over  the magazine was dead  and oh, man, at the time i thought i've got another 50, 60 years to live  what am i gonna do?  tim ferriss   so how did you decide on travel?  cal fussman   i didn t k now what to do  i had met, when i was in st  louis, a woman from france  and she came from monpazier and she says  oh, you have to come visit monpazier and pick the grapes  so in my mind, i always thought i've got to get to monpazier  so we bought tickets, i bought a cheap ticket through iceland air  they would land you in iceland and then fly you into luxembourg  and the idea, i guess, was to get you to somehow stay in iceland   tim ferriss   it is  they still sell it  it s like the stopover destination  stay for a few days, please   cal fussman   and you know what? people should because one of the playboy centerfold photographers told me that that was one of the best places that he d ever been to in terms of meeting women  he said it  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    was like outrageous  you d go there on a saturday night, and everybody knew everybody but by 4 in the morning, people were naked doing cartwheels on top of the bar  and like who would have thought of it, from iceland? tim ferriss   iceland, it s a limited number of activities, depending on the time of the year  but i actually went to iceland for the first time with my family to see the aurora borealis about two winters ago  just glorious, fantastic, entirely mystical word defying experience  it really was fantastic  so that s maybe the other more brochure friendly side of iceland  but yeah, a lot of booze  and elves  they like elves and gnomes, also  but booze   cal fussman   that sounds like a magical moment in your life   tim ferriss   it was  it was   cal fussman   did you have a notion of what it would be, and then did it top it by ten times?  tim ferriss   the back story, not to turn this into   well, i guess it is the tim ferriss show so here we are  but to digress into my own stuff for a minute, my mom had always talked about wanting to see the northern lights before she passed on  this came up many, many times  and eventually, i was like fuck it, why haven t we gone to see the northern lights? let s figure it out and that s how the trip came about  and in my mind, of course, the image was informed by the photos that i had seen  it turns out that the colors that are captured by all of the photographs or equity that i've seen, are very different when you see the phenomenon in real life with your own eyes  it s just the most ghostly, fantastic   meaning phantasm like experience that i've ever had visually without aid of plants  we really just got the willy wonka golden ticket  because we showed up, and we were there for i want to say ten days, which is important because you could have a few days of cloud cover  and if you re only there for a night or two nights, you could go all the way out into the middle of nowhere in iceland or norway, for that matter, or other places, and never see it  but we saw it, i want to say, seven out of ten nights  it was unbelievable  so it exceed all expectations  it was really a trip to remember   cal fussman   i've just got to ask you one more question   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   please, no   cal fussman   what did your mom s face look like when she got the view that she wanted to have?  tim ferriss   a kid in the candy store, or the description that came to mind first was like a baby who opens their eyes and sees their favorite mobile above them  like just that completely dazzled look where there s nothing else in the world that exists for them in that moment but just the pure joy of that experience  it was great  one of the most gratifying things for me, certainly, that i've ever done for my family, which makes me feel like a bad son for saying   cal fussman   why?  tim ferriss   because it took me that long  it was a great experience  i will say, for those people who are listening who are thinking about it, when i say there are very limited activities, i really mean it, in iceland  we stayed at this place called hotel   i think they pronounce it rangald but it s ranga, r a n g a, which is in the middle of nowhere  and if you do go, two things to note  it s dark all the time, and number two, there are activities that you can pay for but they tend to be on the expensive side  so you can take a helicopter over live volcanoes, which actually was phenomenon  or you can go snowmobiling, etc  but they all tend to be on the pricey side  so you do need to check your budget before you sign up for something like that  yeah, it was glorious  but  so iceland  so you got a cheap ticket on iceland air   cal fussman   cheap ticket on iceland air and landed in luxembourg  and i was with a bunch of friends   tim ferriss   how many friends?  cal fussman   let s see  very interesting  i mentioned one, his name was gary smith  but for these purposes, i'm just going to say there was a friend who was very skinny   tim ferriss   i can t wait to see where this is going   cal fussman   and a friend who was portly   tim ferriss   such an underused adjective, portly   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    cal fussman   i am completely  these are my best friends, okay? the skinny guy, the portly guy  the skinny guy was just coming off a divorce and had basically felt like his whole life had been constricted in this box around wilmington, delaware, and wanted to go out and just see the world, see whatever was out there  and of course, my eyes were open to this because i didn t know what i was going to do or where i was going to go but i wanted to see the world, too  monpazier, let s go pick the grapes! and then the portly friend was a guy who was kind of like the mayor of his job, and the mayor of his city in terms of if you go to the bar in st  louis, he s a fixture  everybody loves him, knows him and the bar, the restaurant, everything is very kind of fixed   tim ferriss   the mike was always his  he could hold court   cal fussman   holding court but even more than that  if you were in st  louis, you knew if you went to llewellyn s bar at 8 30, you were going to see him  and accordingly, where he was going to have dinner  it was only one of a few places  if he wasn t at one, you can go to another  you know the book story  he walked into the place across the street where we got chocolates  so he lived on sort of a ritual  so now, the three of us are let loose in europe  now, the portly guy s only got like ten days  he s on vacation from his job  the skinny guy who d been working at inside sports with me, he s got some time, now  and i'm just kind of walking around with my eyes open wondering where this is all going to take me  so we end up in a mountainous town in italy  it had two names because these countries would get involved in wars and then sometimes, wherever the winner was, they were named  i remember the german sounding name was dorf tirol  and it had a huge mountain  and we found out that on this mountain, ezra pound the poet had lived in this castle  so the skinny guy is like all excited  oh, we gotta go see ezra pound s castle  so we took a hike up to this mountain  the portly guy s coming along, we re having a great time just talking and just breathtaking scenery  we get to this castle and we meet some people and they say  oh, if you would just keep going over this mountain, you will have an unforgettable experience   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    there was a farmer there that is living   you literally will go back to the 18th century  that s how this farmer is living  just keep on going over the mountain, and just walk down this trail  not many people go over the mountain but if you do, you will find this farm  he will put you up for the night  tim ferriss   it sounds like the beginning of a dirty joke   cal fussman   and so we start to get up to the top of the mountain  and now it s getting darker and darker and darker  maybe it s 8 00, i don t know what time it is but we ve reached the peak, and now we almost can t even see where we re walking  but the skinny guy knows if we get down this mountain, we re going to have an experience like no other and that s what he was wired to do  and the portly guy s saying  hey, fettuccine is being served down in the restaurant  they both look at me and say, okay, what are we doing? what do you think i did?  tim ferriss   oh, this is a toughie  i want to say that you went for the village but by the very fact that you asked me   cal fussman   what would you do? and you love both of these guys, and you know that one guy really wants to go over the mountain  the other guy really wants the fettuccine   tim ferriss   i say you can always get fettuccine  it s not going away  but easy to say as the armchair listener of stories, as is the case right now  what did you do?  cal fussman   well, i looked at them both and i just realized, look, if something were to happen by going down, i'm gonna regret it  and i knew in that moment, you know what? there s gonna be a lot of those moments  that was the moment i knew i'm going over the mountain  not tonight  i want to make sure my portly friend is taken care of, he eats his fettuccine  in a few days he s getting on a plane, he s going to go back home  but after that, i'm going over the mountain  and that s what set off the trip  it became completely addictive because i woke up every morning not knowing what was going to happen  and then, you asked before, where does the interviewing shift? so what happened was i had hardly any money  i would go to a bust station or a train station, and i would just walk up and say where s the next train leave out of, or where s it headed? and they would say a name and  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    i'd say okay, i want a ticket  so i would buy the ticket  destination had no meaning to me whatsoever  what had meaning to me was i'd never been there before and i'm going to take this trip down the aisle  the trip down the aisle was where all the stakes were  because as i'm going down that aisle, i've got to look for an empty seat next to somebody who seems interesting  somebody i can trust, somebody who might be able to trust me  and the stakes are high because i know that at the end of that ride, wherever it was going, that person had to invite me to their home  because i had no money to spend night after night in a hotel  tim ferriss   i was going to ask you how you paid for the trip  so it was just savings based until it was extinguished?  cal fussman   well, there was very little money  i'm trying to let you know the stakes that were involved when i got on that train   tim ferriss   they were very high   cal fussman   it was like an athletic event where you re going out and you had to get a roof over your head that night  i'll tell you how seriously i took this, and i'm going to tell you a story after this which shows you what i learned  i'm walking down that aisle and i see an empty seat next to a beautiful woman  i look at her hands  no rings  she s looking at me  she s smiling at me  she could be a super model  i swear i walked right on by   tim ferriss   why?  cal fussman   because there was no way she was taking me home! there was no way she was taking me home  now, nobody can see me but if you saw me, you would know  the super model was not taking me home   tim ferriss   in fairness, billy joel got christie brinkley   cal fussman   christie brinkley  that s right   tim ferriss   no offense to billy joel, and i'm not comparing you to billy joel  i think you re a very handsome man, but just to say about how things happen   cal fussman   i'll tell you a story about this, that i came to later regret that, alright? so it s years later, and i get set up working at esquire,  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    where i do this what i've learned column  and i get set up to do an interview with petra nemcova, the super model  i'm waiting  she s supposed to arrive at 8 00 or something and she s late  so i'm sitting there waiting for her, and then she sits down and we start talking  we have this amazing conversation  people may not know but she was in thailand when that tsunami hit, in a bungalow with her best friend who basically lost his life and she was swept away by the tsunami and narrowly survived  this is an amazing story  it took an hour and a half just to tell the tsunami story  she s telling me these great stories, and we re really hitting it off  and finally, and the interview is supposed to go for an hour and a half  we re at four hours  and it s not an interview anymore  i feel like completely connected to her, the way i would have been had i met her on a bus or a train  and i said to her, i said  petra, i'm going to tell you something, i apologize  and she said, what for? and i said, because all those years, those ten years i was travelling around the world, if the empty seat was next to you, i would have walked right on by you just because you were good looking  and she had a very amazing reaction  she grabbed me by the hand and squeezed my hand, and she said  well, don t worry cal, tonight i sat next to you  which is very cool but it made me realize   and this is really   if you re a good guy who s a little scared to approach that woman, you should remember that story  because they want to be treated normally  i was talking to another actress about this, and she really started riding me  she said  okay, so you don t take that seat and now some asshole takes it and i've gotta put up with that asshole for the next hour and a half  thank you very much, cal  tim ferriss   so you walked by this woman when you got on the train  you walked down the aisle, you choose survival and housing over the prospective romance   cal fussman   waked by the super model and i'm looking, looking down the car  okay, that grandmother with no teeth eating the crackers out of her purse  there s the winner  so i walk up, sit down next to the grandma  let s say we re in hungary, and this happened in many cultures  but for the sake of the story   and this happened in hungary  i sit down next to her and i'll ask her about goulash  now, of course she can t speak english  my hungarian at that point is hi, how are you, i need to go to the bathroom   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and some of the younger people on the train are watching me and grandma try and talk to each other  and naturally, they come over and they start to translate  he wants to know what makes a great goulash  this grandma s chest just burst with pride  and now she s talking about her grandmother making goulash, her mom making goulash, all the ingredients that go into goulash, how they ve got to be put together just the right way  and then she looks at all these young hungarians and said  you know, i've been riding on this train for decades  not one of you has asked how i make my goulash  this american, he asked  you tell him he has to come to my house because i am going to prepare him goulash so he knows what it s like to eat goulash in hungary  all the people on the train, they come along  now i'm staying with grandma  not only does she invite the people on the train  all her neighbors, all her friends, her relatives  now i'm at the table, a room full of people  they re all surrounding me  the goulash is in front of me  and i slowly lift it to my lips  i taste it  my eyes shut and i smile  and there s just a roar from this place  he loves grandma s goulash! the party goes on for like four days  and during the party, one of the neighbors says, have you ever tasted apricot brandy? because nobody makes apricot brandy like my father  he lives a half an hour away  you ve got to come to taste the apricot brandy  that weekend, we re tasting apricot brandy, having a great time  another party starts  another neighbor comes over to me  have you ever been to kiskunhalas, the paprika capital of the world? you cannot leave hungary without visiting kiskunhalas  now we re off to kiskunhalas  i'm telling you, a single question about goulash could get me six weeks of lodging and meals, and that s how i got passed around the world  tim ferriss   that s incredible   cal fussman   ten years  ten years   tim ferriss   so what else did you learn about asking questions or, if you want to tackle it a  inaudible  way, feel free to take it in any direction but what are some common mistakes that people make in asking people questions, whether it s on a train or otherwise? but feel free to tackle either   cal fussman   you know what, that s a good question for a little later because that s what i discovered later on  at the time, and i'll bring it directly toward hiring people where questions are being asked of  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    job candidates like, what s your biggest weakness? which they ve already prepared two hours on how to answer that question  you re not going to get a spontaneous, good response to that  tim ferriss   i work too hard  sometimes i get accused of being too detail oriented  got it   cal fussman   you got it   tim ferriss   nailed it   cal fussman   that is the wrong question  but we ll get to that  because i wasn t there yet  i didn t even know what i was doing other than okay, you ve got to figure out a way to make people trust you through your questions  and i no longer had to fill out a story  i didn t need a who, what, when, where, and why  it was just pure curiosity  and then it zoned into this basic fact  people want to talk about their lives  and often, especially if you go to a small town somewhere, people may not be able to talk so much about their lives because everybody talks about everybody in these little towns, and everybody knows the gossip, everybody knows the feelings and you have to keep some things to yourself  but if this guy comes into your house and he s from 7,000 miles away, you can open up in ways and tell him things you would never tell people close by, knowing he s going to leave  and keep in mind, there were no cell phones  there was no social media  there was no facebook, there was no going on the internet and finding out what this person just told me  it was like a secret   tim ferriss   it was a safe haven   cal fussman   yeah  i was completely safe with these people  not only that, but i was a safe haven for a lot of women  because if they were in a small town and they are meeting somebody from their small town, everybody s going to know about it  but if you meet this traveler, your eyes are going to be open to this new world, plus you can go over to the next town and have a meal and start talking and get to know each other  and you re kind of free of all the constrictions of where you live  and so in a way, i became handsome  you know? it s like i can remember in college going into a bar in colorado and like all the guys were 6 foot   i don t know what it was at night but everybody was like 6 foot 4 or taller, you know? and the  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    girls were over 6 foot, and i'm just kind of walking around, and i'm like much smaller  i just realized i don t fit in here  it s just a different  i'm not handsome here  tim ferriss   it s like every dutch or swedish party i've ever been to  similar feeling   cal fussman   there you go  i'm traveling around, right, and i meet a 6 foot 2 dutch girl  want to share a room as we re traveling? okay, fantastic  it was so easy because we were in a different place and once you re traveling, you re a much different person than you are when you re at home  people see you differently and they treat you differently   tim ferriss   you see people differently, too   cal fussman   yes   tim ferriss   wouldn t you say, in a sense?  cal fussman   that s right   tim ferriss   i don t recall who said this initially but people will travel to the other side of the world to pay attention to things that they routinely ignore at home   cal fussman   bingo, yeah   tim ferriss   it seems like a modern day, or i should say a different manifestation of this is sitting down on an airplane next to someone  you can get people to open up, or they ll volunteer to open up in ways that they might not to other people because they assume, rightly in most cases, they re never going to see you again   cal fussman   that s it, 100 percent  when you talk about seeing people differently, when you re waking up in the morning and you don t know what s going to happen, and then you meet somebody, the person becomes the most fascinating person in the world in that moment  and they feel that because you don t know their life, so you re starting to ask some questions  and they re getting this attention  i don t want to say you re making them into a rock star, but they re getting the same kind of attention, the questions that are coming  why did you do that? what kind of friends do you have? what s this culture like here? and all of a sudden, they re feeling like they re in the spotlight and  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    it feels good  and for women, it feels great  and i'm sure if you re feeling boxed in and you meet somebody from afar, i wonder what it s like in america? maybe he ll like me  maybe he ll take me home with him  maybe i can visit  and so all of these conversations are just filled with possibilities and potentials  it s beautiful  tim ferriss   in both directions, too, i think  i remember just in some of my travels, you come across not just the natives but you meet other people who are traveling from distant lands and kind of finding their own way in the same way that you are  and you start to wonder, maybe i should visit turkey  maybe i should visit the paprika capital of hungary  it s just sort of the endless possibilities when divorced from the routine of your life at home that are so exciting   cal fussman   it s that and also, i remember that the skinny guy and i were in yugoslavia  this was right before the olympics in sarajevo, and it was cold  i remember we looked at each other and just were like, it s too cold here  we didn t have winter clothing  i said to him  you know, there are camel races in deus, tunisia  and a day later, we were in tunisia  we just got on a flight and flew to tunisia and headed to deus  we missed the races but the next thing you knew, we ve got pictures of us in the middle of the sahara desert  so there was just the possibility  look, it s even more like that now  you ve got the internet to help you connect with somebody  you can get on a plane and be in a different world   tim ferriss   sure, couch surfing  there are cost free options out there   cal fussman   if couch surfing was here when i was going around the world, i don t know, i might   tim ferriss   still be going?  cal fussman   i might still be going  i'll tell you that it was the end of the trip that changed my style of interviewing again  if i could have been couch surfing, i can t even imagine the potential i would have had because from what i'm told, you get rated  it s sort of like uber  you rate the driver?  tim ferriss   that s right   cal fussman   so you rate the place you stay and they rate the guest  so basically, i'm coming in with all these stories to regale you from these  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    different parts of the world  i'd get a ratings and 5 star ratings across the board  and then everybody would want  come to my place  please come to my place  but there was none of that and every day i had to get on the train or the bus unless people were passing me around  after awhile, it became easier and easier  because it was  well, you know, i've got a cousin here  and then i get off the train and the cousin would be waiting for me  and a party would be waiting for me at his house when i got there  so really, it was like a ten year party  tim ferriss   i do want to get to the end of the trip and the impact on the interviewing  and i can t believe i haven t asked you this before, but how did you hone your ability to tell stories? because you re very good at asking questions but that doesn t automatically make one good at telling stories   cal fussman   maybe part of that is the writing, because that s what i was doing  i would interview people and then i would have to put what i got down in a specific order or a non specific order in order to manipulate people into leaning closer  what s gonna happen, what s gonna happen?  tim ferriss   meaning like an in media rest sort of in the middle of the action type of start to pull them in?  cal fussman   yes, exactly  you started to pull them in and then wait, wait, wait a minute  now you have to go back to the beginning  i suckered you in here  but then there are other, more complicated ways where you don t start that way in the beginning and you save it for the end, but you do it in a more nuanced way  it s almost like okay, i'm reading but something is   tim ferriss   can you give me an example? i m so curious  because for people who aren t writers, and i'm to going to lose track here but i haven t been to journalism school  but when i've taken some writing classes that talk about the lead, and at least for non fiction stuff you get a couple of statistics, you need a couple of quotes  like three people is a trend and then you sort of piece it together  don t bury the lead, meaning bring this attention grabbing piece to the top, and so on  we talked briefly about the in media rest  what would be a more subtle way to approach an opener?  cal fussman   okay  just say you had a murder story, and you were operating by that principle in journalism like put it right at the top  and then  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    okay, this horrible thing happened  let s go back to the beginning and now you ve got to add everything up to see why that moment happened  another option is to start it in a very ordinary way with just a twist that tells you something s going to go on, here  i don t know and you just keep reeling them in slowly, just give a little more  oh, man  and then they met this person  what s going to happen now? and then, you save it until near the end of the story  part of the problem is when you do that in a magazine, they ll give it away in the headline  tim ferriss   i was going to ask about the headline   cal fussman   yeah  but you can still use that tactic of telling a story that slowly grabs you in and it just puts out a little bait and gives you that smell there s something interesting here  and then you re dragging the line so that they ve got to keep following it  and they re feeling, you know what? something big is behind here  and make them get to the end  and then if you can deliver, i don t want to say it s orgasmic but   tim ferriss   it s funny  i was thinking of this sexual analogy  instead of the wham, bam, thank you ma am quick fix, it s like okay, i didn t think i needed some tantric sex and two hours of this, turns out it s pretty great  and then you get the pay off and you re like, you know what? that was totally worth it   cal fussman   you ve just named it  it s the tantric sex     tim ferriss   the tantric structure   cal fussman     story telling  that s it  sting would love it  six hours   tim ferriss   so at the end of your travels, what happened that affected you?  cal fussman   so i'm going around, i'm having a great time  after ten years, i got a pretty good network of people  so i don t really even have to rely on meeting somebody   tim ferriss   grandmothers eating saltines   cal fussman   because enough people know me and when you re in brazil, oh, there s this  speaking foreign language  farm where they grow the cocoa beans  and great couple, just go there  we ll send the  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    letter in advance and they ll be expecting you  so i am, at this point, it s almost like i'm a guest that s now expected  tim ferriss   part of the family   cal fussman   really, i'm part of the family before i even arrive  and a friend, the skinny guy, got married  and he decided to take a year and spend it in cochabamba, bolivia  so i hear that, and i'm thinking   tim ferriss   i hope his wife to be knew that plan before signing up   cal fussman   oh, she did  and that was it  we don t have any kids  let s do something outrageous that nobody expected  and so naturally, i hear cochabamba, bolivia  hey, i was in peru  now, skinny guy is moving to cochabamba  hey, i'll spend a few months in cochabamba  so i'm there, and i get a call from the washington post sunday magazine  and again, going back to this nexus, the guy in charge had worked at inside sports and now he was in charge of his own magazine  and he called me up and he said  you know what? we re doing an issue about great beaches around the world  we know you ve been to brazil before  is there a story about a beach in brazil that you could write up for us? at the time, i said look, i'm in cochabamba, bolivia  you would think it s crazy but i was really getting into cochabamba, bolivia  it s like a completely different culture, there s al de plano, it s a landlocked nation  you really are experiencing something different as a traveler  but i said okay  i said  you know what, i actually heard of a beach in brazil  you might not want me to go there because you re probably doing this as a travel issue to basically get travel agents and airlines so people can go to these destinations  this beach that i heard of is in the north of brazil  from what i heard, you can t even get there unless you go on a crude sailing vessel and on mule back  and the editor is saying  you know, why don't you just check this place out? so i say okay, and i leave cochabamba, i go to brazil  i end up in a city called fortaleza  and just as i arrive, the first trip to this isolated beach, sand dunes that look like they re straight out of the sahara abutted against the most sparkling waters of the caribbean, the first tour bus is going to go to this place  there are going to be dune buggies  we don t have to go by mule, we don t need the crude sailing vessels and i'm just right on time   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and so first bus leaves at midnight, friday night  i buy my ticket, get on the bus and i let down my guard  and i spoke to the beautiful woman on the bus on the way to the enchanted beach in brazil, and that was the end of the trip  i would tell you the rest of the story, except it takes two hours to do  you re not doing it on tape but if  inaudible  any limits, we ll be out of there  the important thing about it was that was the moment where my style of interviewing had to change again because i was no longer traveling around the world  the woman and i got married  we moved to new york, started to have kids and then i began to write for esquire magazine  and all the things that i'd learned on busses, trains, i was then able to project into esquire s what i've learned column, which consists of interviews with the most celebrated, accomplished and creative people on earth  tim ferriss   i have the handy recorder, the h4n on top of one of these, in fact  the what i've learned, this is the third volume, is that right?  cal fussman   that s the third volume  these interviews have been done for almost 20 years, now with everybody from presidents to premiers to movie stars  basically people that you know  and the idea is for me to interview them and using their own words, show them in a light that you never really knew  so you think you know these people, and then you listen to their experiences and you say  whoa, i never knew that about robert de niro or mikhail gorbachev  so that is where these conversations on the trains were so important  because i did not approach these interviews with woody allen or wolfgang puck, george clooney, as if i was a journalist  i approached them as if they were sitting on the train next to the empty seat and i just sat down next to them  that is where the evolution continued, until actually very recently  it was 20 years  so it took me ten years that an interview as more than meet the press, but then another 20 to figure out that it was more than sitting down with george clooney and having the time of my life  because a crazy thing happened to me, caught me completely off guard and made me think about interviewing in a whole different way  and this was only very recently   tim ferriss   can you talk about that?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    cal fussman   oh, yeah  no, 100 percent   tim ferriss   can you mention that, just because you brought it up and then we ll dial back the clock?  cal fussman   sure   tim ferriss   can i share something first, also? i've digested this entire thing with highlights and so on  there are notes on writer s block, jody foster s comment, one of my favorites just for folks  in the end, winning is sleeping better  i just love that  it s so good  highlighted woody allen  it just goes on and on  so i love this entire copulation and encourage people to check it out  but what changed so recently?  cal fussman   i was asked to give a speech on a cruise  and i never, ever, went on cruises before  in fact, i've got to say it s almost laughable because there are certain people, they hear cruise and they turn up their nose  and i think i was one of those people  in fact, i had a friend who is a writer, and his wife wanted to go on a cruise  and she kept on pestering and pestering him  my wife finally said to him, why don't you take your wife on a cruise? and he said  because i draw the line  and i said  oh, man, maybe i think about cruises that way  and then i was invited to speak on a cruise  but it was a special cruise  it was a cruise called summit at sea   tim ferriss   yep, done by the summit series guys   cal fussman   okay, so you know these folks  so basically, it s a cruise ship filled with 4,000 entrepreneurial minds  and that was wild to begin with because i had limited experiences with entrepreneurs  and then you put yourself on a ship with 4,000 entrepreneurs, your life is going to change   tim ferriss   a lot of potential energy  it s like ted plus coachella plus infinite amounts of alcohol   cal fussman   there you go  and you can t even get on an elevator without meeting somebody, somebody on the elevator is goin to say, what s your name? i'm michael  this is where i work, this is what i do  who are you? i felt, at the end of three days, my head was really, it was kike getting pumped up with helium  i was about to explode  it was an amazing experience  like you re sitting down at dinner and the guy next to you says  oh, this is a rocket ship pump  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    building  you want to see? and he pulls out his phone and he shows you his rocket ship  this is like wild  it was like traveling around the world except the world came to you  tim ferriss   i think jane goodall was there, also  it just goes on and on   cal fussman   the world is coming to you and wanting to hear you and tell you what they re up to  so in three days at summit t sea, you literally can go around the world  i was totally unprepared for this  i was asked to give a speech called  decoding the art of the interview   i'd never spoken before, didn t know what it was going to be like  but i have experience with mikhail gorbachev and donald trump and de niro and mohammed ali later on in life  they re good stories  i'd been telling these stories as i was traveling around on saturday nights and people were always like  oh, tell ali s story  so i knew, okay, i don t know how to give a speech but i can tell these stories  and so i go up, and here s the thing about it  there are 20 events going on at once  generally, when you look at that what i've learned column, i'm invisible  i don t write a single word  i just interview them, the subject, and then put it down in their own words  so i'm not a guy who you would ever see on tv that you would really know  i'm invisible  so i'm thinking, yeah, there are people who know what i do and people in the know will come up and tell me hey, i respect what you do, in odd ways  but i'm figuring okay, i'm on this cruise ship  maybe 20 people are going to show up at best  and in fact, i had read pencils for promise by adam braun  he talked about giving   it might have been his first speech  and i guess he was expecting a crowd, and he had maybe six friends attending and only one person other than his six friends showed up  and he went out and he gave this speech, and what he realized was you give the speech as if that one person is the entire audience  and it turned out that she was so enthused that she later went to work for his charity  so i went in prepared  that book prepared me  if there s on person i there, i don't care  i'm going to give that person the best  i'm not going to be disappointed  i'm just going to go out, tell my stories, give a few lessons, and let s see how it goes  maybe the same day that i'm supposed to speak, they move my event  so now even in the program, you re going to the wrong place   tim ferriss   you re going to the wrong place   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    cal fussman   so now i'm thinking okay, i'm down to like ten people  that s cool  i'll speak to the one  the time for the speech comes  people start filing in  i had set up this speech around wine, and there s a reason for it because in one of the stories   we can get to it a little later   i went out to learn about wine by becoming the sommelier at windows of the world at the top of the world trade center right before the planes hit it  so i'm very attached to wine, and what i wanted to do was to have everybody drinking a glass of wine while i told these stories  so if i messed up, they were still  inaudible      crosstalk  tim ferriss   helps with reality bending, also   cal fussman   that s right  we set it up so that all the wine is there ready to be served to people as they come in   tim ferriss   but budgeting for ten people?  cal fussman   no, i said okay, there are 150 seats  if 150 people show up, fine  have the glasses and the wine but let s face it, you may only go through a bottle  so they wwere all prepared  the place seated 150  it was this funky nightclub  and all of a sudden the time starts to roll around, and i'm watching and people are just flooding in  they take up all the seats  i was very specific to the people serving the wine  i set up this speech to have toasts throughout to keep everybody s involvement going  so everybody had to lift their glass and scream with me  it was to keep everyone engaged  so i said to the people delivering the wine  look, i need you to be able to walk down this corridor down the center and keep everybody s glasses filled because it s bad luck to toast with an empty glass  and so we re all set, and now every seat s taken and there are still like ten minutes before the speech is set to start and people are still coming in  and now they re coming down the aisle and they re sitting at my ankles  and they re filling the aisle, they re sitting cross legged in the aisle   tim ferriss   you re sitting behind the bar   cal fussman   that s right   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   taking up the foot space   cal fussman   to the back, the complete back and now there s a line of people out that can t get in  i've become like the hottest nightclub in new york city and i've never done this before   tim ferriss   not to derail this, but what do you attribute that to?  cal fussman   i think what happened is we   tim ferriss   they switched you with richard branson in the program? i'm just messing with you   cal fussman   no, that s good  i'll have to work on that next time  i think what happened was we titled it  decoding the art of the interview with mikhail gorbachev, robert de niro and donald trump   and naturally, it said cal fussman has interviewed these people but people came in wondering what s it like to interview gorbachev, or de niro, or donald trump?  tim ferriss   and we ll definitely dig into some of that   cal fussman   okay  and so i'm watching all these people flood in, and now the aisle is completely cluttered  i can t get wine to people  now i'm starting to freak out because i i don t want people toasting with an empty glass  the back of the room is getting jammed packed  and so i just said, well, just go out and give your speech  so the speech, it lasts for about an hour  it gets a really good response  but what was surprising about it was afterwards, there was this long line of people to see me, and they re business people  the first couple came up, two women  they say okay, you taught us about asking questions  we ve got a problem  we are really passionate about our business  we can t seem to find people to work for us that are just as passionate as we are  what can we do? what can we ask? i said oh, that s easy  just tell them the dr  dre story  dr  dre story? yeah  i said i was interviewing dr  dre and i said to him, what s the longest you ve gone, working on a passion project without sleep? and he said  oh, man, when i'm working on something i really care about, i'm in the zone  i don't think about sleep  it s just i go until it s done  could be 72 hours  so i said  just tell the person you re interviewing, dr  dre, he goes 72 hours  what s the longest you ve ever gone on a passion project  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    without sleep? you ll be able to tell something about that person by their answer  and look, they may tell you, you know what, i get eight hours of sleep every night because i come to work every mooring fully charged  and you re going to know, hey, maybe that s the right person for a certain job in your company that s not going to be the most completely passionate person, but maybe they re the person that s got to do something nuts and bolts  tim ferriss   right, the cfo or the guy who interacts with wall street   cal fussman   exactly   tim ferriss   or gal, in fairness   cal fussman   yeah  and so you will find out through that answer something that s going to help you make a decision  and you could tell they re looking at okay, that  sour question  we ll tell them the dr  dre story  and then people started coming up to me, like running successful businesses who had to hire a lot of people all at once because the business is doing really well  and you could tell they were nervous  because all of a sudden a business that starts with an idea and only them is now taking on 1,000 people in a year  how are you sure that those 1,000 people have what you had when you started the company, that essence? because if they don t have it, the essence of the company is no longer what you wanted  and guys like that, and women, are coming up and saying  you know, next time you re in san francisco, can we get together? because i can tell there s obviously an issue with hiring  it s funny because now i'm starting to ask everybody about it and i'm really becoming very conscious that this is like an issue that s really important to a lot of people   tim ferriss   oh, it s the challenge  we were chatting before we started recording about silicon valley and some of the issues surrounding attracting and retaining top talent  it s the fundamental challenge for a lot of these startups in particular, when you go from perhaps hiring   say if you bootstrapped for a period of a time, ten people in a year to hiring ten people a day or a week  it s a massive challenge, putting together a process for that  a question for you about the presentation  if we were to try to decode decoding the art of the interview, is that the name?  cal fussman   decoding the art of the interview   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   if we were going to try to meta that and decode the presentation itself, what story or stories   and i don't think i've heard any of them, for that matter yet, did people seem to respond best to? there s one that i have tucked in the back of my mind because when alex, a mutual friend of ours, asked me if i had heard this story and i said no, he was just   i'm not going to say disgusted but just speechless at how i had not managed to hear this yet  but what did people respond to best in terms of stories?  cal fussman   interesting  different people respond differently to the different stories  if i was deconstructing the speech, one of the things that i wanted to do was to explain how much you can do with a single question in a short amount of time  to back that up, i told a story about my meeting with mikhail gorbachev  so i'll take you back to, say, 2008  i think it was february  we re in new orleans and i m in a hotel lobby  i'm all set to interview mikhail gorbachev for esquire s what i've learned column  we ve got an hour and a half  fully prepared, ready to go, couldn t have been happier  and i get a call  i pick up the phone  hi, cal  it s the publicist  sorry i have to pass this on but the interview with mr  gorbachev is going to have to be cut short  and now i'm thinking oh, man, is it going to be down to an hour? because that s the thing  with this what i've learned column, i can t fluff it up, i can t fill it out  i can t use my words  they have to be mikhail gorbachev s words and they have to be wise words  i need, at the very least, an hour to move into his soul in a way that makes him feel comfortable and extract that wisdom  at the very least, 45 minutes  so i say to her okay, okay, how much time do i have? ten minutes  ten minutes? i don t want to ay are you nuts but that s impossible  i can t do this interview in ten minutes  cal, look, i understand but a lot of very important people have been added to the list to see mr  gorbachev  there s nothing we can do about this  do you want the ten minutes or not? what am i going to do, say no? okay, i'll take the ten minutes  so i'm sitting down and the more i'm thinking about this, the worse it s getting because number one, i'm knowing that all of my questions are going to be translated into russian, and all of his answers are going to be translated back into english   tim ferriss   so you actually have five minutes   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    cal fussman   yeah  we re moving down  plus, you re going to sit down, you re going to exchange pleasantries  it s not going to start in a finger snap   tim ferriss   you have two and a half minutes   cal fussman   yeah, exactly  it wasn t two minutes but it wasn t much more  and so the publicist leads me into the room, and at this point i'm thinking okay, if it s two and a half minutes, just do your best  i look up and there he is, gorby  and he s a little older than i remember  he s about 77 at the time  he was in town to speak about nuclear weapons and why they should be abolished  and we sit down, and i'm looking at him and i just know, just know he s expecting my first question to be about nuclear arms, world politics, paris troika, ronald regan  he s just ready  so i looked at him and i said  what s the best lesson your father ever taught you? and he is surprised, pleasantly surprised  he looks up and he doesn t answer  he s like thinking about this  it s as if, after a little while, he s seeing on the ceiling this movie of his past  and he starts to tell me this story  and it s a story about the day his dad was called to go fight in world war ii  see, gorbachev lived on a farm and it was a long distance between this farm and the town where gorbachev s dad had to join the other men to go off to war  and so the whole family took this trip with the dad to this town to wish him well as he went off  and gorbachev is talking about this trip and he s providing these intricate details, and i'm transfixed but i'm saying oh, my god, i asked the worst possible question  this interview is going to be over and he s not even get to telling it  finally they do get to town, and gorbachev s dad takes the family into this little shop and he gets ice cream for everybody  and gorbachev starts describing this ice cream and the cup that it was in, this aluminum cup  and as he s telling me, it s almost like he s got his hand out in front of him and the cup s in it  it s that vivid to him  and it s as if in this moment, we both have this same realization  that cup of ice cream is the reason that he was able to make peace with ronald regan and end the cold war  because that cup of ice cream, just the memory of it, is the memory of what it felt like for his dad to go off to war, for him to see his dad going off to war  that cup of ice cream in the memory was the dread that he knew of the possibility of never seeing his  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    father again  we re looking at each other like oh, man, this is deep  he didn t expect it any more than i did  just at that moment, knock on the door  it s the publicist  the publicist comes in, very efficient  mr  gorbachev, cal, the time for the interview is up  and he looks at her and he wags his finger and he says no, i want to talk to him  publicist puts up her hands, yes sir, and she backs out sheepishly  the door shuts, conversation continues  now we re getting deeper  ten minutes later, another knock on the door  this time, the publicist comes in a little slower  mr  gorbachev, cal, and gorbachev says, no, i want to talk to him  she backs out  ten minutes later, knock on the door  this time she s in a panic  tim ferriss   the train cars are just piling up   cal fussman   mr  gorbachev, please, i've got the mayor of new orleans right outside, there s a long line of people, we re way behind schedule  and gorbachev just smiles  he didn t say anything but the look on his face was hey, what can i do, cal? so i said thank you  i knew i'd pushed it to as long as it could be pushed  i left, and the interview was a success in that it had a little story like that and people could understand something about gorbachev that they might never have known  but for me, when i look back on it, what i realized was the power of the first question going straight to the heart and not the head  because it was that question that went into his heart that took us to that very deep place and enabled the interview to continue to go  and because the interview could go, i was able to fill out the page for esquire  otherwise, that would have been it  there would have been no way the interview would have run  so lesson number one, when people ask me what tips would i give, is aim for the heart not the head  once you get the heart, you can go to the head  once you get the heart and the head, then you ll have a pathway to the soul  and so basically, the speech was lessons tied to stories that backed them up  whether it was with gorbachev or donald trump, or robert de niro or mohammed ali, each story allowed the listener to understand something very basic   tim ferriss   i'm going to pick a name that we haven t heard yet, just because this is the one that made alex dance around because that s all he could do to respond before he insisted that i ask you about it  so julio caesar chavez   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    cal fussman   that s another story  it goes back to a time when i was a teenager  again, as i started out, you knew that my childhood hero was mohammed ali, and so i followed boxing  naturally, i wanted to fight  where i lived, there were no boxing gyms around  what we had in new york was a tournament called the golden gloves   tim ferriss   golden gloves, big deal   cal fussman   yeah, sponsored by the daily news  the final sold out madison square garden every year  i had no idea how to fight and i wanted to do it  so basically, a month before the golden gloves started, i showed up at a gym that was a few towns over in a bad neighborhood and said i want to train for the golden gloves  you had to be 16  i had just turned 16  i entered  this manager pulled me aside and said no, that s not the way it works  you don t know how to fight  you don t know anything about fighting  what you do is you come here every night and we ll teach you  within a year, we can put you in with people who have your experience and you ll learn, and then a year from now, you ll have some experience and you can go into the golden gloves  if you re good, you ll do okay  i said no, no, you don t understand  i came to fight   tim ferriss   thanks pops, but listen   cal fussman   that s right  and basically, i wasn t on the tall side so i was a short guy with very short arms  my style was basically hey man, i'm just gonna rush across the ring and i'm just gonna start throwing punches   tim ferriss   joe frazier style   cal fussman   that s right  and you ll see what happens  because like joe frazier knew how to fight   tim ferriss   right   cal fussman   all i could do was just throw reckless, wild, crazy punches one after another  i was in good shape so i could throw punches three minutes a round, just start to finish  it was actually, for the people in the gym, it was kind of comical to watch because everybody knew think about when i finally got in the ring, one of two things was going to happen  maybe i'd be able to just simply overwhelm whoever was in the ring just by sheer virtue of, i'm coming at you to throw everything i've got and i'm not stopping   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   that tasmanian devil strategy   cal fussman   that s right  you got it  a month passes or so, and it s time for my fight in golden gloves  there was somebody at this club that was going to represent me  i show up at the club  he was going to drive me into queens, new york  i was living on long island at the time, and i was all set  so i show up for my manager to pick me up and he s not there   tim ferriss   left at the altar   cal fussman   right  now i don t have a manager, i don t have a lift to get into this place  there are no cell phones  you re standing by a pay phone throwing in quarters, like who can help me? i've got to get to the fights  i've got to fight  and of course everybody in the school knows about this  so it s at a high school in queens with a very large gym arena  it s like a catholic school  i managed to get somebody to drive me down there and i arrived just in the nick of time  but now, i'm all nervous just to get there  i'm able to check in  i wrap my hands, get my gloves on and out of nowhere comes my opponent in the dressing room  and in the most causal way possible, he just puts out his left hand and says, jesus  that was his name  but you couldn t tell  not only was there a scar down one side of his face to his lip, but you could just tell he had done this like 400 times before he was 8 years old   tim ferriss   right, this was like checking in for work   cal fussman   that s right  it s complete  now i'm starting to realize, uh oh, this could be a predicament  i get somebody who i'd never met before to work my corner  and this guy has no idea of my style, no idea  he thinks okay, i know how to fight  so he says okay, kid, listen  we re going to go in the ring  i want you to just take it nice and easy, move around a little, show him the jab and let s see what happens  so we start to walk in the arena, and this is like mid  70s  in fact, it s a few years before the rocky movie came out, the great white hope  i'm like the only white fighter on this card, and 90 percent of the audience is all white, okay? so when i come in the ring, it s like the great white hope has finally arrived  people are standing, cheering, going nuts  i'm looking around and it s like  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    it s surreal  i've lost sense of where i'm at  in one ear i've got  okay, move around, jab  i've forgotten who i am  we get to the ring go to the center, get the instructions and i am completely lost  i do not know what happened  all i remember was getting up  actually, my eyes opening and seeing three fingers that were very blurry, and i'm hearing four, five, six  i get up and now i can kind of see clearly, and jesus is coming at me  his right hand comes back, and it s right in front of me, right in front of me and the bell rings  so i go back to the corner, and now i'm pissed  like what just happened to me? get in there! throw your punches! just go at him! and i'm sitting on the stool, the manager is saying something and i don t even hear what he s saying because all i'm hearing is myself just screaming at myself  throw punches! remember who you are! in the meantime, the ref is coming over and he s saying  son, are you okay? are you okay? i m saying, of course i'm okay  i'm gonna kick his ass  i m gonna come out and you re gonna see some punches! next thing you know, the referee is waving his hands and stopping the fight  i didn t respond to him  i was out  tim ferriss   so this dialogue that you were having with yourself, that was entirely internal?  cal fussman   that s right  i had no idea  no idea  the worst part of all of this is my dad is in the crowd, and he brought two of his childhood friends  so now, you can imagine what i'm hearing  any time there s a family reunion, any time this comes up, we need a funny story  it s like oh, remember cal and the golden gloves  i'm hearing this again and again and again over the years  and finally almost 20 years later, right after i meet the woman in brazil, she moves to new york, we get married, and i'm watching the tv and julio cesar chavez, the great mexican champion, junior welterweight, 140 pounds  he was 85, 86 and 0 at that point  i'm watching him on tv as he s cornering an opponent  i've got a big bag of chips between my legs and at this point we re right after the marriage, i ve put on a bunch of weight so i've got a beer belly  i've got a beer in one hand, chips in the other, belly between them and i'm screaming at the tv  come on, finish him off! what are you doing? finish him off, julio! and my wife looks at me and says  hey, calm down  we ve heard your boxing stories  because that was the first thing, when my family met her, that they indoctrinated her  you know about cal and the golden gloves,  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    don t you? so i look at her, i look at the tv, and it s clear what needs to be done, here because i've got to get my manhood back  and i said to my wife  you know what? do you see that guy on the tv? julio cesar chavez? i'm gonna fight him  naturally, my wife is like, you re crazy, forget it  we ve heard the story  but now i know i have to do this to close this chapter of my life, no matter what  tim ferriss   now just to place it, so at the time you re writing for esquire?  cal fussman   actually, when we moved to new york, i was writing for a magazine called gq  my editor at gq was a guy named david granger who later became the editor of esquire and when he did, he brought me and a bunch of writers with him  so this all started at gq  the day after my wife is laughing at me, i march into david granger s office and i say  hey, you want to buy a story? i m gonna go fight julio cesar chavez  he says, what? i give him the background and he said alright, let me go in and check with my boss   tim ferriss   let me see what our insurance policy looks like   cal fussman   that was the first thing  you re going to have to sign documents saying we re not responsible for this  this is all on you  i said, that s fine  i go down to the times square gym on 42nd street at the time and up these rickety, old, wooden steps  it was like something out of the past, like you could literally hear each foot that you put down and there s the drumbeat of the bags and you walk up there  and since i had followed boxing, i knew who people were and i just start looking around at the trainers  there was a guy i recognized  his name was harold weston and he had fought tommy hearns, the welterweight champion   tim ferriss   tommy hearns was nasty   cal fussman   yeah  he had actually done pretty well  he was a very slick boxer  he wasn t that tall, and tommy hearns was likesix two, six three  tremendous reach and unbelievable power in his hands  that fight went awhile  i know tommy scored a tko but harold had done pretty well avoiding the punishment  so i went over to him and i said  hey, i'm gonna be fighting julio cesar chavez  do you think you can train me? now he s just like, what is this?  tim ferriss   who sent you here? looking for the hidden cameras   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    cal fussman   you got it  that s exactly it  he s going  this guy says he s gonna fight julio cesar chavez  everybody in the gym is like  are you a professional? no  are you an amateur? well, i have one fight in the golden gloves 20 years ago  it didn t turn out  and now, harold s saying  okay, okay, you re really gonna do this, huh? i'll tell you what  you come back tomorrow, like 3 00 and we ll do a little workout and we ll see  so i come back the next day, and this guy, he just tortured me  the whole point was  get out of here  you re not fighting julio cesar chavez  you have no idea what it s like to be a boxer  like, a little respect for the craft, here  after three hours, literally i was reduced to tears again and again and again, and i just kept going  i remember getting home to my apartment and i rang the doorbell  the door opened and i literally collapsed into my wife s arms  it s like she dragged me to the tub, had hot water going  she threw in some epsom salts and i just laid in there for three hours, unable to move  when i left the gym, everybody in the gym was placing bets whether i was going to come back the next day, and i did  that was the first moment where  hey, that s interesting  and he said okay, i understand you re writing this for gq  he was a fashionable guy so that lured him in, the style element  he said  so you re really gonna do this? i said  yeah, look, i'm just asking for one round with julio cesar chavez  one round  that s it  but i'm going out there and i'm giving it my all  he said  well, look, let me show you ways to get through that round  now remember, he s a slick boxer  i'm gonna teach you how to move and you will survive  we can do this  if he s taking this really seriously, you re going down  but who knows? we don t know how he s going to react  maybe he ll be curious and i will teach you how to move around the ring and protect yourself so that you don t die  in my mind, i'm also now thinking about the fight between roberto duran and sugar ray leonard  i don t know if you remember  it was the second fight   tim ferriss   no mas   cal fussman   no mas, that s right  where in the middle of the fight, we don t know what really happened  it s never fully been explained  in the first fight they had, duran won by a decision in montreal and afterward, he went back to panama as a national hero, 50,000 people waiting for him at the airport and he just had like a three month binge party and gained like 50 pounds  in the meantime  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    leonard, after his first loss, went back home and was training the next day for the rematch  o they set it up to have an immediate rematch six months later and after he had maybe two months left, duran started to train  now he had to take off 40 or 50 pounds  he was in no condition to do this but he dramatically lost the weight  we ll never know but he was overweight a few days before the fight  now, whether he took exlax or something to purge his system, or whether, after he made the weight, he went out and ate three steaks and a bunch of orange juice, we know that his stomach was not in the best of shape  but we also don t know if, when he got in the ring, his stomach was bothering him or leonard adopted a style that wouldn t allow duran to hit him and basically broke duran mentally  so we don t know if it was his stomach, or his mind, or both but midway in the fight, duran basically just throws up his hands and says  no mas  tim ferriss   no more   cal fussman   no more  leonard celebrates and everybody watching was in disbelief because for 20 years, roberto duran had been the epitome of the macho man  he was like mike tyson of the lightweights in his era  he just bored straight ahead, nothing could stop this guy  he was relentless  and to see him quit was like what i felt about my experience in the golden gloves  so i basically had to somehow eradicate all that feeling and i had to do it in a way that left me with some shred of pride at the end  so harold says to me  okay, look  i m gonna teach you how to move  and he was like a very classy fighter  and as he s showing me how to move around and avoid punches, i said  no harold, no  that s not the way we re going to do this  no  the first time i got in trouble because i didn t go out throwing punches, and that s how i'm coming out this time  i'm coming out to throw punches, and i want to do it just like joe frazier  joe frazier is a short guy, stocky arms, just bobbing, weaving, coming straight ahead  and harold says  no, no, no i m not going to do this  because basically, now i'm asking harold to teach me a style that is going to bring all of my energy, full focus, full bore, straight ahead, right at one of the most damaging punchers in history   tim ferriss   incoming missiles   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    cal fussman   that s right  he s just fighting with me  there s no way  i'm not being a party to this  if we do this, we do it smart and you come out alive  you re not going in there like joe frazier   tim ferriss   all due respect, you re not smoking cal   cal fussman   that s right  i said no, i want to you teach me like joe frazier  and he said  okay  you want to be smoking joe? i can teach you how to be smoking joe  and he pulls out a rope and he sets it, from one   the top of the rope s on one side of the ring   to the other, and he makes me start, bobbing and weaving under this rope  now, anybody who has never done this before, after a minute your thighs are burning and basically harold s idea is i will make him do this so long that he comes to his senses and fights the way i tell him so i can protect him  but no matter how much it burned, i just got down low and i just bobbed and weaved and moved my head  and then he d take me to the bags, and now he s teaching me how to throw punches  because i didn t know how to do any of this stuff  and then you have to get in the ring  and i m 35 years old and all these kids are 19, 20  they love to get in the ring because they want to beat the crap out of me  believe me, they were because i did not know how to fight  but every day, i just kept on going back  i literally trained like a fighter  it must have been four months  and plus, on the other hand, i had to figure out a way to get julio cesar chavez in the ring with me  he had no idea of this   tim ferriss   he had no idea that you were in this intensive training camp with no agreed upon fight   cal fussman   not a clue  he doesn t know that i exist, and i am training three hours every afternoon, plus running in the morning, plus calisthenics at night  i'm eating just the way harold s telling me  my weight goes from 165  now i'm down to less than 147, closing in on 140  chavez fights at 140  at this point, he s 87 and 0 with i don t know how many knockouts but i think it was in the 80s   tim ferriss   very high percentage   cal fussman   yes, very high percentage   tim ferriss   i remember also, just as a side note because i was mystified and just captivated by julio cesar chavez and at some point they  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    looked at x rays of his head and his skull is like twice as thick as a normal human being  cal fussman   that s right  so he was used to coming straight at people and absorbing whatever punishment they were dishing out in order to land his shots  and believe me, when harold heard that i was doing this, he said  look, cal  i know a guy who fought julio cesar chavez  his name is juan laporte  basically, after that fight, laporte was pissing blood for a long time because one of chavez s biggest shots was this left hook to the liver  and he s saying  you don t understand  this is a professional athlete at the top of his profession  you know, a lot of guys think, oh, if i was out on that football field, i would have made that catch  they see a professional drop the ball  i would have brought that in  and lots of times, they drop passes that the rest of us might have caught  but you don t understand what it s like to be up against a professional athlete until you are  because even these amateur kids were knocking my head off every day  but i just kept coming back up them steps, kept on coming back up them steps  finally, a friend of mine, the skinny guy, writing for sports illustrated had been sent to do a story about julio cesar chavez  so while he s out interviewing julio cesar chavez, he says  oh by the way, i've got a friend who wants to fight you  is it okay if he comes and fights you? julio said sure, send him over  he only wants one round  fine, fine  it ll be great  so now julio has said yes   tim ferriss   i m just imaging it s like if your second grade self in a different era had written to tiger woods, being like, my friend in second grade wants to play you in golf  like, sure  yeah, why not? send him over   cal fussman   julio is a fun loving guy  you know, maybe he saw it as a joke  i don t know  at this point, it s like months i've been training  now you look at my body, i've got a six pack and now i'm getting in the ring and i was up against an amateur who was really beating me up badly in the beginning  and then one day he threw a right hand at my head and i ducked under it and i clocked him with a right hand  and he just went sprawling backward  now i'm starting to think  okay, julio, are you ready? are you ready for this? all the people in the gym are laughing  it s all part of a community where it s like, what is going to happen? at this  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    point, gq meanwhile is funding this  they re funding all the training and they re going to fund my trip to mexico  they ve got to send photographers  they ll send my wife  now i've got an entourage going down to mexico to fight julio cesar chavez  and he s training to fight pernell whitaker  this is like the biggest fight in his life  tim ferriss   i remember this   cal fussman   he s actually not really training that hard  like we see him  we re supposed to have our fight while he s in training, and i'm seeing that he s going to different towns and having parties so i'm starting to think   tim ferriss   this is after you arrived?  cal fussman   this is after i arrived  i didn t know  i thought maybe he s normally like this  but something in my mind was saying if he s fighting pernell whitaker, he should be a little more focused than this  so i'm waiting for this appointed day and harold weston, my trainer, new the president of the world boxing council, jose sulaiman, who set up a weigh in  gq made me a robe  julio was very amused by all of this  we went out running one morning and the thing about it was julio trains in toluca, mexico  high altitude  so that was my first moment where i said, uh oh   tim ferriss   this might be an issue   cal fussman   yeah, because i trained really hard back in new york but all of a sudden at altitude, you re not the same  so we re running in the morning, and it comes to this day where okay, we re gonna do it  i show up, i've got my gq robe on  but they invited kids from the neighborhood in to come witness this, and the kids thought oh, this is a fight  so julio is set up, i'm set up and we re ready to go  the one thing julio said was  look, i can t wear 8 ounce gloves like you re going to wear because i'm scared i'm going to hurt my hands  so i'm just going to wear training gloves but other than that  and i said, no head gear  i said, this is a fight  i'm coming to fight you  so he just wanted to protect his hands  he had these white gloves, i wouldn t call them pillowy but there was cushion in there   tim ferriss   what are they, 12 or 16 ounces?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    cal fussman   yeah, i don t know if they were 12 or 16 but they weren t 8 like mine  that was the only difference  jose sulaiman, president of wbc, asked the guy to ring the bell  and all of a sudden i go charging straight in the style of joe frazier, right at julio cesar chavez  he looks at me and he s used to coming straight ahead  and now he s saying, whoa, what s going on?  tim ferriss   what the hell is this?  cal fussman   now, here s the thing about this  harold said to me  look, you don t understand how good he is, how quick he is  you have no chance of hitting him  do you understand me? like all the work you did, there s only one chance you have, and i'm gonna tell it to you  you listen to me, you listen to me good  this is the strategy  i want you to throw, just like i've been teaching you, a left jab, straight right hand, left hook  okay? he s gonna catch those punches  then i want you to do it again  left jab, straight right hand, left hook  he s gonna catch those punches  then i want you to do it again  left jab, right hand, left hook  and he s gonna catch them again  then i want you to keep on doing that again, and again, and again  do it 20 times  and then, on the 21st time, if you re still standing because we don t know, he may just hit you in the liver and that s the fight  if you re still standing, if you do that 20 times in a row and you re still there, go left hand, right hand, and then come back with another right hand  and so the bell rings, and now he s circling around trying to figure out who is this lunatic coming at me like joe frazier, bobbing, weaving, snorting  i could sound like joe frazier  but he s so fast that just like harold says, i throw the left hand, i throw the left jab, he catches it  i throw the right hand and he catches it  i throw the left hook, he catches it  the first time i did it, he said okay, i know what you ve got  i'm just gonna see how much you can take in a little while, but we ll play this out  we ll play it out  so i keep storming in, i keep throwing these three punches, he keeps catching them  he s moving me around but i keep throwing these three punches again and again and again  finally, like two minutes into the round, i go left jab, right hand, and then you could almost see him lifting his hand to catch my left hook and i just throw the right hand and it just socks him in the jaw  and he looks at me and he sprawls backward as a way of saying okay, you caught me  okay, okay, okay   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    he goes back like he s staggered and then he smiles at me and says okay, now we re gonna fight  now we re gonna fight  he comes in on me and he throws a left hook to my liver  i'm telling you, ,it was like someone took the pipe of a hoover vacuum cleaner, attached the vacuum cleaner that was on full blast sucking up and just shoved it down my throat  down to my stomach, and it s like my whole stomach is coming up through my mouth  the thing about it was, i just started throwing punches back  it was his way of just saying i'm going to give you just a little taste, but now i'm firing back  because as bad as i was hurt, this was my moment  i had to avenge what happened to me when i'm 16 years old and i m firing back  now he s starting to hit me  and so jose sulaiman, ding, ding, ding, ding  the round s over  i go back to my corner  my lips are blue  the altitude and that one shot literally took everything out of me  but in my mind, i did it  i'm here  i did it  and julio, he s training for his fight  he looks over at me and says, valtro? you want another? and i said, si, mas  and we did another one  and then in the second round, he was having fun but he was starting to attack me pretty good  and you could tell jose sulaiman is watching this and he s saying, a minute and a half into the round  ring the bell, ring the bell before   tim ferriss   before we have a gringo casualty on our hands   cal fussman   that s right  and so the bell rings, i go back to the corner, we embrace  he was really wonderful about it  because what was cool about what he did was he treated me, now that i think about it, he treated me like the assistant to president johnson treated me  he didn t laugh, he saw my punches coming, he saw what i could handle  and then when he saw that i had outfoxed him for a second, he said okay, i'll lift the game but i'm not here to level him  and so it was a really wonderful experience  they had been teasing my wife, asking her how much insurance we had and stuff like that  but at the end, he really rose to a high level in the way he handled the whole thing  because at the end of it, i walked out of it after going through everything i did, i pushed myself as far as i could go, i got hit in the liver and i came back  so now it s just a good story   tim ferriss   when you spoke to your wife after the two rounds, later that night or whenever you actually had a chance to decompress and be by  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    yourselves, how did she describe what was going through her head as she watched you guys after the first bell ring? cal fussman   i think she was pretty scared  i think she probably was watching with her hands over her eyes but with her fingers spread so that she could see  i think she was really proud  and you know, the thing about it is you realize it s not so much about winning and losing, although my kids, it s crazy because my kids hear the story and they tell their friends in junior high school or whatever and their friends are like, did he win? they have no concept  but the thing is, i did win because i confronted myself  i had to go up those rickety steps every day  i had to get the crap beaten up out of me every day in order to learn how to duck a punch  and i did  i pushed myself as far as i could go  and now i get a great story out of it  when i talk about the golden gloves, it s just a funny part of the story  it s not something that eats at me anymore  i need that part of the story to set up the ending  so i'm thankful that happened to me because without that, without a, i wouldn t have done b which led to c   tim ferriss   that s a healthy way to think about a lot of things, i suppose  people, even if they re not storytellers or writers, if they think about their mishaps or some of the challenges they ve had, it s the part a they needed to set up part b   cal fussman   you know what? it is a great way of looking at life  and man, i have taken a beating so many times  one of the great things about telling stories is when you realize that okay, this beating i just took, maybe i can use that to get an advance from a magazine to do something cool  and again and again, i use my mistakes, foibles, humiliating moments to come back and try to make some sense of them and triumph over those moments  again, you don t have to be perfect, you don t have to win but you have to look deep inside of yourself and know that okay, i respect myself for this  and to this day, i really do  it gets complicated when people look at the picture  i have a big picture at home of me hitting julio  and people look at it and it looks real  it looks authentic   tim ferriss   it is real   cal fussman   it is real  but it lends people to say, what happened? what was the result? the result was i survived   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   so cal, there are so many more stories that even if not on tape, i will have to ask you about but perhaps we ll do a round two  we have to talk at some point about mohammed ali  we have to talk about trump, we have to talk about de niro  there are so many other things  the james beard award, the list goes on and on but i know you have a dinner to get to  do you have a little bit of time for some of my customary rapid fire questions?  cal fussman   i love those questions   tim ferriss   alright   cal fussman   i hope i have rapid fire answers   tim ferriss   they don t have to be  that s the whole twist on the phrasing of the rapid fire questions  the questions can be rapid fire but your answers can be as long as you would like them to be, or short   cal fussman   i love these questions   tim ferriss   alright  the first that i usually start with is when you think of the word successful, who is the first person who comes to mind, and why?  cal fussman   you mentioned him during the course of this interview  there are two people  one is this kid alex benyan, who s 23 years old  he was in school at usc and his parents had basically raised him to be a doctor to the point where, during halloween when he was a kid, they would dress him up in scrubs  just get the point? that s where you re headed  he gets to college, and he s got a stack of biology books next to him and he just can t do it  he s really smart but he s just not linked to it  and he starts to wonder, what am i doing here? he s going to school at usc, it s a great school  he starts to wonder about this word success  and he goes to the library and starts to look at biographies of people who he deemed to be successful, to see what the definition of success was  and he s reading biography after biography and he realizes that the book that i'm looking for doesn t exist  i need to go out and to interview these people to find out what they think success is  and so he did  and on his journey, one of the people that he went to interview was larry king  and he actually met larry outside a whole foods  he saw larry pushing his shopping cart and went running down the street  larry king! scared the bejesus out of larry, and  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    asked if he could interview larry, and larry invited him to breakfast  and when he arrived, alex says i'm writing a book  and larry said to alex  well, if you re writing a book, then you should talk to this guy  you should talk to cal because he s written two of my books with me and he can help you  so alex did get to sit down to talk with larry but i became very close with alex at that point  so when i think of success, i think of everything alex was trying to find out  that s one  the second is another boxer, george foreman who you might remember  tim ferriss   my mom s favorite boxer   cal fussman   really?  tim ferriss   oh, yeah  north carolina she remembers the old george   cal fussman   the old george  now, the old george was a bigger mike tyson   cal fussman   oh, my god, terrifying   cal fussman   tyson was what, six feet maybe? george foreman was six three, 220 and just had a string of vicious knockouts and won the heavyweight title by knocking joe frazier down six times  one time, he literally hit him with an upper cut and uprooted joe frazier like he was a tree stump   tim ferriss   it looks like a super hero movie  for people, i'm sure you can find footage of it but if you look at george foreman frazier knockdown or knockout, just the footage is unbelievable   cal fussman   you re looking at somebody there who george foreman grew up in a very tangled situation  his personality was formed one by living in poverty  he would go to school in the mornings with a brown paper bag that had no food in it  and he would blow it up to make it look like there was food in it so he wouldn t be embarrassed by the other kids  on top of that, his siblings, his sisters, would make fun of him  he was younger  they would say  you a mohead  you a mohead  and george foreman had no idea what a mohead meant but he knew it wasn t good  he would hear that and he would chase his sisters around when he heard you a mohead, you a mohead, and finally, years later, he grew up and he found out what they were  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    saying  george foreman s mom was married to mr  foreman, but they separated for awhile  while they were separated, his mom went off with a guy named leroy moorehead, conceived george and then went back to mr  foreman  and so when he was born, his siblings who were foremans would call him  you a mohead, you a mohead  and so there was this angry part of george  tim ferriss   very angry   cal fussman   to the point where he told me people would be scared to ask him for an autograph  when he would walk into a place, people would look down  he had this surliness was a big part oil and gas his demeanor  when he went to fight mohammed ali in zaire, he was the undefeated champ, people feared for ali s life  and in fact, ali would not watch george foreman hit the heavy bag  it was too scary  this guy could hit that hard  what ali saw was george foreman had so much anger in him that when he came out, he just came out to bludgeon whoever was in front of him  and ali had a sense that if he could make foreman expend his energy and not land those punches, to have those punches come off his arms, if he could infuriate foreman to the point where foreman lost his cool and punched himself out, he figured out a way to win  and naturally, in the heat of africa, it was basically ali set this thing up perfectly  foreman arrived with a german shepherd, not knowing that the zairians had in their history a memory of german shepherds being brought in by the belgians to keep them under control  so the zairians immediately hated george foreman  and a chant grew out of it  ali boomayi, ali kill him  and the bell rang and george foreman came at ali, and ali didn t move  he just kept his back against the ropes with his hands up   tim ferriss   this was the rope a dope?  cal fussman   this was the rope a dope  and george foreman is just slugging away, and ali would open his guard up just a little and say  is that all you got? and close his guard and foreman was just getting more and more infuriated, just punch after punch  first round, second round  those of us who are watching, and i was watching on closed circuit television on a big screen in st  louis at the time, you were almost crying because you were screaming at ali  get out  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    of the way, dance do something  w couldn t see what was happening  he kept talking to george  we couldn t hear him talking  oh man, that s it? that s all you got? and foreman is just throwing shot after shot after shot  and then all of a sudden, in the fourth round, you see foreman throw a shot, and ali just duck under it and then just throw a jab straight back in foreman s face and foreman s head snapped back and we realized, oh, my god, he s punched himself out  as the fight continues a few more rounds, ali nails him the one right hand  it s so hot, foreman s exhausted, ali nails him with a right hand, foreman goes down, can t beat the count and he s crushed  it must be akin to what rhonda rousey, for those who are younger and watch mixed martial arts, what rhonda rousey went through after her recent defeat  where you think somebody is invincible and then all of a sudden they re on their back  tim ferriss   one head kick later   cal fussman   that s right  and george foreman, for 20 years, could never get another title shot, he retired and he did something, and he told me what he did  and he said this was the hardest thing when you talk about success  i asked him a question about success, and he said the hardest thing you can do in life is to change your character  and basically, in his early 40s he came back to boxing but he was completely different  he was no longer the surly guy  he was a guy who would do ads for eating hamburgers, smiling and laughing   tim ferriss   correct me if i'm wrong  i remember his comeback promotional videos where he d be going for his boxing run and people would be handing him food?  cal fussman   that s right  and he starts his comeback at i think more than 300 pounds   tim ferriss   big guy   cal fussman   he  s a big guy and he s in his 40s  but it s what he changed in his head  now he was smiling   tim ferriss   what did he do to change that?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    cal fussman   he realized that surliness and that anger is what brought him down against mohammed ali  so fast forward, he s 45 years old and he gets a heavyweight title fight against a guy 20 years younger named michael moore   tim ferriss   oh, i remember  southpaw   cal fussman   southpaw, who is much faster, a little lighter but should be able to move around george with ease and just put punches into george s face without george being able to respond  but here s the thing  foreman came into the ring wearing the exact, red trunks that he was wearing when ali hit him and put him down  when moore s trainer saw that, he recognized it and thought uh oh, something's up here  and basically, george didn t waste any energy  he rearranged his character had moore, for the first nine rounds, completely out boxed him, moved around  george just kept his hands up, tried to land, could barely even land and his face started to get swollen  the tenth round started and his trainer, who, coincidentally, was angelo dundee, mohammed ali s trainer who was in the opposing corner in zaire, basically said to him  george, you re way behind  you gotta do something  and george just kept moving forward and without wasting energy, just saw one moment and he threw a right hand  he still had the power  he still had everything that he had when he was young powerwise, and he clipped moore straight on the jaw  and michael moore went down and couldn t beat the count  foreman went over to the corner, got down on his knees, thanked the lord and to me, that was a symbol of success because he needed to change who he was in order to have that success  and he did it at 45  so that s the best answer i can give you   tim ferriss   love george foreman  this just reinvigorated so much more enthusiasm about learning more about george  it brings back so many memories because i remember that fight  also, i want to say george used what i want to say was the crab defense  in other words, he didn t hold his forearms together perpendicular to the floor, but they were kind of crossed over in front of his face  such a good story   cal fussman   it was all designed  he knew he was going to endure punishment, and he knew that he had to do it in a way that expended the least amount of energy, and he knew he just had to put himself in the right position to land that one shot  so it s a beautiful story to see  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    somebody take their weakest point and do something within themselves to change who they are  tim ferriss   and the history repeats itself irony of that fight that he won also is that michael was known as a very angry guy  he had a criminal record and probably lost for some of the same reasons   cal fussman   that s right  in fact, i'd have to go back and watch the fight but i'm sure his trainer, who was aware, was probably saying  you know, you re way ahead, take it easy, stay away  and he probably said what are you, crazy? i got his under control  boom, one shot   tim ferriss   incredible  what is the book or books you ve given most as gifts, other than your own which obviously, for people listening, you know i'll link to everything in the show notes, as well   cal fussman   hard question to answer because it s almost like wine  every meal, you re going to have another experience with different people, different food  i like to give books that i've loved  i mentioned meeting alex, and he didn t know how to write a book  and he s like, i want to write a great book  you could just tell it was bursting out of him  so i gave him gabrielle garcia marquez s one hundred years of solitude for him to know okay, if you ve never written a book and you re going to tell somebody you want to write a great book, alright, read this and know what a great book is  so my gifts tend to judge what the person needs and then fill that need  and no different in wine  if somebody s having a steak, i'm probably not going to give them a riesling  i'll give them something to complement the steak   tim ferriss   i'll give you more specific circumstances  let s say that somebody came to you and they said  you know what, i'm a bored billionaire and i want to give three books to every graduating high school senior in the country this year   cal fussman   wow, what a question  okay  one book that people should read, and in fact, i've got it with me right now  let me pull it out, here  one of the blurbs on this book actually says, as tony morrison, this is required reading   tim ferriss   wow  that s a strong endorsement   cal fussman   tony morrison is a great african american writer  this book is called between the world and me, and it s by a guy named ta   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    nehisi coates  it s a letter to his son about being a black male in america  i think it is required reading just because if we want to understand what is going on, we see what s happening in ferguson, missouri  it just seems like it s month after month after month we see protests and problems  and this is just a way of redirecting your eyesight to a place that you normally wouldn t go  it s an amazing thing about this book because as i'm reading it, i was walking down the street and i passed a news box with the los angeles times in it  on the front page there was this statistic that said that basically every juvenile that s incarcerated in the state of california, it costs us  260,000 a year  tim ferriss   that is a lot  more than any ivy league education   cal fussman   there you go  think of that  if you took that money and put it into lifting that same kid, who knows what would happen  there s dna involved, there s a lot of stuff involved but it just made me realize why aren t we putting the resources in before rather than just paying this money out we don t even know that we re putting it out? and so it s just a book that makes you see the world differently  another book that i would recommend, it s a book that i'm reading now   tim ferriss   and just for those people wondering, between the world and me, this is a short book, about 130 pages, national book award winner  i will order that as soon as we finish this chat  but you mentioned the second   cal fussman   the second book is, is it okay if i give you two?  tim ferriss   you can give me two, absolutely   cal fussman   i can do two? just because these are two that i'm reading now, so it s just hot off the press  it s a book called speak like churchill, stand like lincoln   tim ferriss   i love the title   cal fussman   i think i'm carrying it around with me, as well   tim ferriss   this is amazing   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    cal fussman   you hit me at the right time with this question  it s written by james  c  humes  for anyone who wants to speak, and if you re a high school senior, at some point you re going to have to get up and speak, it s a great book because there s all kinds of tips on everything about speaking   tim ferriss   subtitle  21 powerful secrets of history s greatest speakers   cal fussman   there s this great anecdote in this book that really helped me as i was preparing to give my speech  because it s hard to memorize a speech  and then i'm reading about ronald regan, known as a great communicator, american president  when he spoke, he riveted people  when he was a young man, again we re talking about basically the same age as the people you just mentioned  what would you recommend for the high school senior  actually, regan was just getting out of college, and he got a job in radio in iowa  he was very good conversationally on the air  but then it came time to read the advertisements  and for some reason, he was so stiff and awkward reading these advertisements that the advertisers basically said get him off the air, and they fired him  he went back to his room and he s feeling horrible about it because he loved being on the radio  he loved communicating  he wondered, what can i do in order to get my job back? so i guess fdr was doing the fireside chats and he realized how riveting those were  so he got those chats and he started to read them  but what he did was he would look at the words, and then almost memorize the phrase in his head, then look up and say the words conversationally  so he wasn t trying to memorize them by reading it off the page  he would just take a few of the words, then look up, give you those words, look down  he would never speak while he was looking down  and then he went back to radio and that s how he did his advertisements and it worked  the book is just filled with little tips like that that will make it so much easier for anybody who s got to get up and give a speech   tim ferriss   i'm going to get another book for my list  do you have any favorite documentaries or movies?  cal fussman   you know, it s a really interesting question  i probably would have told you that there s a movie, cinema paradiso  you love that movie?  tim ferriss   great film   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    cal fussman   i would mention that but something happened to me recently where a documentary and a movie came together that provided this amazing experience  the documentary was called men on wire, and it was about philippe petit s walk on a wire across the towers of the world trade center  it s an amazing documentary  everything that he had to go through, almost like a spy or an espionage agent to figure out how to get up on the roof  we re not even talking about how do you walk a rope  that s one thing  but then to wonder how do you get to the top of the world trade center as it s being built and get a wire from one side to the other, to stabilize it at night when nobody's watching  and the documentary takes you through the whole thing  it s just amazing   tim ferriss   and the way they pieced it together with the alternating black and white reenactments, just the cinematography and the pacing is genius   cal fussman   it s definitely my favorite documentary  but then last year, robert zemeckis did a movie called the walk   tim ferriss   is that joseph gordon leavitt?  cal fussman   that s right   tim ferriss   i haven t seen that yet   tim ferriss   here s the thing  i saw this movie nine times   tim ferriss   the walk?  cal fussman   the walk  i saw this movie nine times but you ve got to see it on 3d imax  because one of the innovative things about this film on 3d imax is you literally feel like you are on the wire  people left the theater vomiting  i knew everything about that story because as you mentioned, i worked at windows of the world  so when i was serving wine at the top of windows of the world every day, i was looking down at basically what philippe petit was looking down at when he was crossing this wire  and i'd seen the documentary so i knew that basically not only did he walk on the wire, but he laid down on the wire on his back   tim ferriss   unbelievable   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    cal fussman   and then the police are coming, and the police had been haunting him for years because for whenever he would try and juggle or walk the wire in order to get people to give change, they would be trying to chase them away  so he had this cat and mouse game going with the police all these years, and now he s on the wire more than 100 stories above new york city  and the police are there and they can t touch him  he can do whatever he wants on this wire  so the tables are turning and yet, in this movie, when he steps on that wire, i knew everything that was going to happen on that walk  i m begging him  no, don t do it, please don t do it  i completely suspended my disbelief  and let me tell you how much  i started taking people night after night to see this movie, again and again because i want to gauge their reactions   tim ferriss   gave them motion sickness pills beforehand?  cal fussman   i warned them  i said if you ve got a fear of heights, don t come  go watch robert de niro in the apprentice or whatever they called that movie  what hit me was there s this one scene in the movie where he s learning how to walk the tightrope  this is back in france  that s where he s from  he s like two steps away from getting back to the platform and he slips and has to catch the wire with his hand  he s like 50 feet above ground or something, and he manages to get back to the platform  he comes down and his teacher is there  his teacher basically says to him, it s the last two steps  the people who die, they die on those last two steps, remember that  and in fact, philippe petit was paying him to get those lessons  and when philippe petit went to give him money for that lesson, the teacher said no, this lesson you get for free  this doesn t cost you anything  so i knew this story cold i'd read his book, i've seen the documentary many times and i'm watching this film  and when he falls down early on to get that lesson, it s shot in a way where the pole literally comes out of the screen right at your head  so the first time, you re just swaying immediately to the right or the left to get out of the way  okay so how i'm watching it the second time  i know this pole is coming at my head  every time, on the ninth tine, the pole was coming straight at my head  i'm ducking out of the way  it was that visceral an experience and the direction was just amazing  i love the acting  if you can see that movie on 3d imax, please do  it s just wonderful   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   i guess i'll put out a request to perhaps the people involved with making that film, if they happen to be listening or if you know the people involved, since people might not get to see the theatrical release in 3d, talk to the people working with virtual reality  get in touch with the oculus folks or some of these other studios, daqri or whomever might be able to translate some of this to an immersive experience for folks because that s coming down the pike, too   cal fussman   that d be beautiful   tim ferriss   you know, i feel like we re just going to have to do a round two sometime   cal fussman   i'll come back anytime   tim ferriss   i'll ask three more  if you could have a billboard anywhere with anything on it, what would you put on it?  cal fussman   one word  listen   tim ferriss   listen   cal fussman   i don t know what reaction that would get but i would like to see the reaction on people s faces when they saw that  because i think that listening is not an art form  well, it is an art form  people just aren t using it as an art form, but it is an art form  a lot of great things could be achieved through listening   tim ferriss   what advice would you give your 30 year old self, and if you could place us again where you were at 30   cal fussman   i would not give myself one word of advice, and i'll tell you why  because if i would have given myself that advice at 30, it would have moved me maybe one centimeter in one direction that put my life in a different place  and i needed to be on a very specific seat on a very specific bus at a very specific time in order to meet the woman that became my wife and is the mother of my kids  so i couldn t have that moved in any way  i needed everything to happen just the way it did in order to have that moment, in order to have the rest of my life  so after that, i'm sure there are times where i would have given myself advice  really the time i needed advice was when i was in college and there was so much offered and so little i took advantage of   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    tim ferriss   what would your advice be either to your kids or to people going into college when they say  uncle cal, what should i take? i just don t even know what to do with myself  paradox of choice  i can t figure it out   cal fussman   if they want to travel, you get a chance to learn four languages, five languages  and it s going to be so relaxed  all you ve got to do is just go into the class and then meet somebody from the opposite sex who speaks the language and you re going to be going out and talking in the new language, and you could do that over and over again in college  you ve got that time  one of the things that if it was me knowing that i wanted to be a writer, or knowing that i'm now going to be speaking, and i'm going to be speaking about questions people ask when they re hiring, i would love to have studied human behavior  because i know that when a company is looking to fill a job, if the person doing the interview understands the role that needs to be filled and understands human behavior, they can ask questions to the applicants that will fill that role in a really good way  that s my hunch   tim ferriss   have you ever heard the story of the book that newt gingrich used to navigate politics, at least one that he s credited with a lot of whatever success he s had? chimpanzee politics  i'm not kidding  i am not kidding   cal fussman   i'm going to write that one down and i'm going to go home and order it   tim ferriss   i am not kidding  what about as a writer or to a kid who d graduating from college and says to himself or herself, should i go on to get my mfa or continue to go to a specialty journalism school or writing school? if they d only taken maybe one or two classes that required a lot of writing, what advice would you give to them?  cal fussman   i would tell them just write  the great thing about it, and i'm not knocking the schooling because as we talked about earlier, i owe everything to the university of missouri journalism school  it sent me on my way and then the connections  on the other hand, all you need to do to be a writer is to write  and not only that, but all you need to do is to find places that are interested in taking your  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    writing  it doesn t have to be for much money  but you can go out, especially now, you don t even need a physical publication  now you can just create a blog on the internet and just start writing  so i would advise people if you want to be a writer, write and just keep writing and keep writing  if you have the means and the will to go to school and get a teacher or teachers who can help you through, even better  but nothing should really stop you from writing and you shouldn t use  i need to go to school first  as an excuse to put off writing  i need to make the school make me write  you make you write  tim ferriss   yeah, if you don t have that intrinsic motivation, it s going to be hard to make anything happen because you won t always have a school teacher to whack you with a ruler   cal fussman   that s right  and not only that, the other thing is just put yourself in a position where you have no money and you need to write something to make money, and if you need to eat, unless you can find a bar that s putting out olives and little chicken fingers, you re going to write and get paid so that you can eat   tim ferriss   i remember talking to a friend of mine who is a journalist, writes for a number of very well known newspapers  he always laughs when he has to listen to book authors like myself sort of winge and pontificate about writer s block  he just scoffs at the whole idea  he s like, i don't have the luxury of having writer s block  he s like, i have a deadline, a deliverable of whatever it is, 4 p m , 5 p m   he s like i can t muse about the subtleties of writer s block  he has to ship  he has to ship words every day or whenever it might be  every week  what are your thoughts on writer s block, if that s not too general a question?  cal fussman   i only had it once  what happened was i was writing for esquire and working on a column called the perfect man  the idea was basically in line with this conversation  i was going to take all my flaws and all my mistakes and then go to experts who were going to teach me how to overcome them, and then i was going to write about the experience so that everybody could have the collected wisdom  so i learned how to walk through using alexander technique, i learned how to publicly speak by going in the boxing ring with michael buffer and announcing a fight   tim ferriss   sounds like a fun gig   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    cal fussman   that was great  i learned how to lose weight by going to jack lalanne, who was the exercise champion of his day  i went through and learned how to barbecue through steven raichlen, author of the barbecue bible  and one of the last things i did was go to learn about wine  because if you are a man, you want to have a feeling that you can go into a restaurant with a group of people, the wine list comes to you and you don t feel like oh, man, what am i going to do? i don t know what s what, here  and then you don t know if the waiter is going to try to unload a lousy bottle that they can t sell on you, or a bottle for a lot of money  you re helpless  so i wanted to learn enough to know how to walk into a restaurant with confidence and order what i want  and the solution to that was to be trained, to be the sommelier for a night at windows of the world which sold, for a time, more wine than any other restaurant on the planet a the top of the world trade center  i had no idea where this adventure was going to send me but it took me two years to learn all about wine  because you then find out you have to go to these places where they make the wine, and you have to understand the difference between the varietals and the wine list at windows of the world, it was hundreds of pages  to know all those wines was almost impossible but you start to get an idea  i had world class sommeliers teaching me and for one night i was the sommelier at windows on the world  it was an amazing experience  one of the great things i did is i had a guy who i knew come in  he brought his wife  it s like the first couple of the evening  i seated then right next to a window so you re looking down on new york from 106 stories or whatever  i had a bottle of champagne, lordo champagne from france, which it basically was like a  10 00 bottle of champagne  but nobody new that  this had been served at the assembl e nationale in france  it was a basic bottle of champagne  i took it out to the couple  they were celebrating their anniversary  i walked over with a flourish and i announced that i was serving lordo champagne, and that it had never been served at these heights before and it would never be served at these heights again  and this woman looks at me  she didn t know who i was  her husband did  she just broke out in tears  and then the husband had never tasted the champagne before but i poured it, they both put it up and they re like  oh, cal, we never knew what champagne was before this moment   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    it teaches you that the wine and the moment are inextricably linked  i can take a great moment and make a great wine out of it, and i can take a great wine and make a great moment out of it  in any event, the evening transpired and it was great, it was profound, it was also funny  i'd spill wine down a glass because i had to be moving really quick  there was a lot of people  and like oh, that s inexcusable  that should never happen here  that bottle is on the house! everybody at the table is like  oh, this is great  and people at the adjacent tables are saying  come over here, spill some here, spill some here  we get through the night, it s a delightful time and really memorable  now, i go home to write the story and i start to go through my notes because it s taken me two years to get this experience  and the planes crash into the world trade center  i remember going to ground zero a week later  the military took me around in a humvee  i was still so overwhelmed that i was almost knocked out when i saw it  because i remember seeing there was this thin coat of white dust over everything  you could see in a parking lot this coating of dust over the cars  and i actually said to the guy in the army who was taking me around, i said why don t those people come back and get their cars? and he put his hand on my shoulder and he said  cal, those cars don t have any owners anymore  it s very hard to explain the enormity but i just couldn t write  how could i translate this experience of utter joy, learning all about this amazing beverage that transformed lives, meeting all these friends along the way  wherever you would go, it was like traveling around the world again  it would just open up a party, and that party would invite you to another party, and another party, and another party  and so there i am, having this amazing experience and then on top of it, for one night i was the sommelier  and not only that, but toward the middle of the night   people were pressing  20 in my hand  they thought i was really the sommelier  and a few days later, somebody who came in that night, and nobody knew that i wasn t the real sommelier, somebody came in three days later and asked for me  so i was feeling so good about the experience, and right after that the planes came in and took the towers down  now, i've got to write the story about this  and the editor, he now knows  he s basically bankrolled this thing for two years  same guy who copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    bankrolled me going up against julio cesar chavez bankrolled the wine story  i'm flying around the world tasting the wines in france, the wines in italy, the wines in germany, going to california  and he allowed me to go through the whole experience  and now he knows something amazing has got to come out of this  because i saw how much he put in, and we all know this seminal moment in american history so he s got to step up to it  and i couldn t  i would stare in front of the computer for hours at a time and nothing would come out  like my eyes would be bleeding  and every time i would have to go into the office to see the editor, i knew, we both knew  where s the story? years started passing  he started to do things to try to help me and push it out of me, whether it was lighthearted or hey  like years now  the movie sideways, which is about wine, had come out  wine is really hot now  now is the time  so the editor is really trying to push this story out of me in the best way he can  it might be lighthearted with a little offhanded joke  it might be  hey, come on, it s years now  we re waiting for this story  the movie sideways comes out  it s a big hit in the wine world  now he s saying, this is the time that the story needs to come out  i can t do it  i'd go to the computer almost night after night and it s the most painful thing because i never had writer s block before  but there was just nothing that would come out of me  it was like a wine that wasn t ready to be served  it needed to be in the barrel, only you don t know how long it needs to be in the barrel, and you re feeling all this guilt  i had these copious notes in boxes  and i put them down in the basement  okay, let me just get it out of my face  because every time i would go into my office, i would see these boxes and i would just flinch  tim ferriss   oh, it seems like a huge anxiety trigger  just the undone homework assignment   cal fussman   the ultimate undone homework assignment that your boss has basically bankrolled for a couple of years  and so you basically know that you can t go in with anymore big ideas until that is completed  so it really affected me but there was nothing i could do about it and i put these notes away in the basement  and then we had this terrible ice storm  i was living in north carolina at the time  everything turned into mold in my basement  all the notes got black   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    so i had notes of anything  basically everything had been wiped out  my notes were ground zero afterward  so now, how am i going to do this? but you know, there was a writer who taught me something very early in my career  his name was harry crews  i don t know if you ve ever heard of him  tim ferriss   no   cal fussman   he wrote a book called feast of snakes  harry crews also wrote for esquire  if you re a young man, and i don't even know how this book would translate now but it was a real kind of macho    tim ferriss   what was the name again?  cal fussman   feast of snakes  he wrote another book called car, about a guy eating a car  this guy was out there  as soon as i read these books i said, i've got to meet this guy  i've got to meet this guy  so i started to tell people, i'm going to go meet harry crews  and people started looking at me saying, are you sure? i said, what to you mean? they said, his drinking is legendary, plus the amount of drugs he puts in his body, you re not going to be able to stay with this guy  you re going to hurt yourself  and so naturally, i get in my car, i drive 20 straight hours down to gainseville, florida  this is when i was living in new york  i go and i drive right up to his house and knock on the door, and there s no response  i knock again, no response  i could almost hear like a snoring  so i just opened the door   tim ferriss   oh, my god, in florida   cal fussman   and harry is laid out on a lazy boy chair with an empty bottle of rum on his belly  i get close to him and his head is just moving around, he s getting himself out of sleep  he says, what do you want? i said, harry, i just read feast of snakes and i just drove 20 hours straight to see you  well, why don't you drive over to gator gulch and let s get us some alcohol  i drive over to the gator gulch   i think that s what it was called  it was something like that  and they ve already got a carton filled with alcohol for me to bring back   tim ferriss   the usual   cal fussman   yeah, the usual  i come back and we start drinking and naturally, after a little while, i had just been driving for 20 hours and now  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    i've been drinking and i'm starting to float away  and he s getting more lucid  this was before the drugs came out  i said to him  harry, you re a writer  do you keep a diary? how can you drink like this, and do all these drugs, and remember anything? and he looked at me and he smiled and he said  boy, the good shit sticks  and it was that line that saved me when i needed to write the wine story  because i always knew the good shit sticks  the moments that were truly great were the moments that i needed  and almost ten years passed  and in a chance meeting with a women who was in a terrible position  she had loved her husband, her husband had died, she was alone, time had passed, she was ready to go out and meet somebody again  she said i'm older, i've never really dated, i don t know what to do  and i said to her, join a wine class  because you will meet people, and just by the way the talk about their wines, you re going to know if you should like them or not  and she said, wow, that s a good idea  and something in that conversation opened up a pathway  i went to a bar, and i'm sitting down and remember, this whole thing started with me just wanting to be able to give somebody instruction  when the wine list came before me, i could give the waiter the instruction, this is what i want, without feeling like i didn t know what i was doing  so i had this conversation with the woman, and a couple nights later i said, you know what, let me just write down the good shit, the good shit that stuck  and i'm sitting at bar and i'm writing down all the stuff, the good shit that stuck  the bartender is pouring drinks and a waiter came back with an italian dessert wine  it was a white wine and the waiter said to the bartender  the people don't like it  they say there s something wrong with it  it was vin santo  so the bartender, he was a young guy and i think he really didn t know much about wine  he was like a college kid as a bartender  and so he said it s vin santo, it s not cheap  and i said wait a minute, let me smell that wine, because he brought the wine back  i said pour me a glass  and so i swirled it around, i put it up to my nose and i said no, it s no good  and the way i said it, i must have said it with such conviction that the bartender said okay  tim ferriss   you said it the same way that jesus said his name to you in the locker room   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    cal fussman   that s right  that s exactly it  i knew this wine was no good  so the bartender said to me, how did you know? we got into a conversation, and he had told me that he had been in a choir  he said, i'm not really a bartender  he explained that when he was young, he was a singer and when he was young, he had actually gone to the vatican and sang in a choir for the pope  and i said okay, fine, then you ll understand this  when you put that wine to your nose, listen to it  you can tell that there s something certainly in the taste  maybe you can get it from the smell  it starts out okay but there s somebody singing off key in there  and i don t know if it s the way the wine was stored but in the middle of that taste of wine are off keynotes  and i don t know, maybe the wine was a little corked, maybe it was just the way they stored it  but as soon as he heard that, he realized it  it translated for him that okay, when somebody in the choir has got a voice that isn t hitting what the rest of us are hitting, it s a problem  and he understood that  he looked at me and he said, thanks  and i knew that was the end of the story  as soon as he said it, i went to the keyboard and i wrote the whole thing up   tim ferriss   that s amazing  do you recall the title of the piece?  cal fussman   yeah, it s called drinking at 1300 feet   tim ferriss   cal, you re a great man  you re a very, very generous person and we will have to do this again sometime  but in the meantime, i want to let you get to your dinner and would love to direct people to where they can find you and more about you, because you ve spent a lifetime gathering, unearthing and telling other people s stories  of course you ve told some of your own, but i want to hear more and more of these stories  next time i feel like we should have some wine   cal fussman   next time we ll do this with wine   tim ferriss   where can people find you online?

and probably 70 percent of you just said  he is my favorite storyteller of all time  please just let him talk for another four hours  so that s effectively what i did, but it s not four hours long  so i hope you enjoy this as much as i did  i never get tired of talking to cal  he s so good at what he does  he s such a nice guy and he s such an incredible storyteller  here you have it, cal fussman,  on twitter  enjoy ''cal, my good friend, welcome back to the show ''cal fussman  thanks so much  i m ready to walk the tightrope with you  speaking of walking the tightrope, someone who s not ready to walk any tightropes is my poor pup molly, who got sedated for x rays earlier today, who s been entertaining us and gaining our sympathy by wandering around and staring off into space  she looks as high as a kite  you mentioned to me that she should be listening to ?''cal fussman  tom waits  tom waits, a name i did not recognize, i m embarrassed to say ''cal fussman  well, if molly was to hear tom waits sing,  the piano has been drinking, my necktie s asleep   that s pretty well the way she s looking right now  thematically appropriate  i thought we would start, and of course we ve been chatting over the last two days   spending time together   about muhammad ali  i just want to pass it over to you because i know it hit you quite tremendously hard, it would seem, and unlike most people listening, you had direct interaction with muhammad ali  so i ll just pass it over to you for your thoughts ''cal fussman  for me, it was almost like having your childhood end when you re in your 50s   on the day that he died  it s very hard to describe the feeling  i hadn t ever really felt anything like it ''in fact, at a time where everybody was sitting down in front of the television looking for reports, i just curled up in bed  i kind of knew the story  i knew everything, so there was nothing more for me to learn  i was just terrifically saddened because he was my childhood hero and there really are no longer many like him  what made him unique? and how did you grow to or get to know him?''cal fussman  i didn t meet him until 2003  at that point, the world knew that he had parkinson s disease  we had seen him at the olympics with the torch  so let me back up to when i was a kid seeing him for the first time ''it s very hard for a lot of people to understand what the  60s were like if you didn t live through them  because every day, you woke up and something else happened that made you go what? what? what? whether it was, sadly, the shootings of dr  martin luther king, jr  or bobby kennedy, or it could have been woodstock, or landing on the moon  every day seemed to bring something that you didn t expect  ali was in the middle of it  that s when he came of age  he won the heavyweight championship in 1964  so he kind of embodied, for me, the spirit of asking questions  because at the time, he had won the olympic gold medal in 1960 ''the story goes   we don t really know if it s true   that when he came back to louisville with his medal, he wasn t allowed into a restaurant and able to sit with white people  so he took his gold medal and he threw it in the ohio river  whether the story is true or not, it makes a point  he was, in my mind, the voice of reason amidst what, at the time, was just crazy behavior  it s hard to imagine that there were places where black people couldn t walk into and sit next to white people  i m walking around now and i m just seeing in these days of black lives matter, just how integrated we are  you go to an airport and there s no longer a thought about this ''but back then, that was the order of the day  muhammad ali was somebody who stood up to that and let people know  hey, this is wrong  and he did it in a way that made people laugh at times, through poetry  he was like the first rapper  you could not take your eyes off him  the other thing that s kind of interesting about it was there were only three networks that you could really watch in those days  right, we were talking about that  it was kind of like bbc 1, 2, 3, and 4, in a sense ''cal fussman  right  and if you have the camera on him, one of the most charismatic figures in the world, nobody else is going to compete with that  so everybody was watching him  it s not like now in the days of the internet and tmz, where he would have been followed relentlessly and every detail of his life would have been on the internet ''you only knew so much, but he was everywhere  probably the most popular or the most well known person in the world  when the vietnam war really started to kick in and ali was inducted into the draft, the way he stood up to it and his famous line,  i ain t got nothing against no vietcong  it s just white people sending black people to kill yellow people   at the time, this sliced the country in half  either you loved him for it or you hated him for it  either you were with the kids out on the street who were protesting against the war or with the people who were beating them over the head  very hard for somebody who s young now to understand that time?''we talk about the conventions that we re having this year  people should go back and look at the 1968 democratic convention  it was a free for all  there was all kinds of violence outside of it  and ali lived amidst this, and he was always, in my mind, asking the right questions  why are we in vietnam? why can t i sit next to somebody who has white skin in a restaurant? it was very simple  and then, there were so many people who hated him for asking those questions and for changing his name from cassius clay to muhammad ali  he was really reviled by a huge number of people in this country  for him to constantly stand up and risk going to jail for what he believed in, the faith that he had ''then it was backed up by his bravery in the ring when he fought with joe frazier and he fought with george foreman  people thought he was going to get killed when he fought george foreman, who was undefeated and had knocked out just about everybody  what about the incredible hulk? i think it was in the warm ups leading up to   am i getting this right? it was in zaire  i might be getting my locations mixed up  i sometimes conflate the frazier and foreman fights  but ali and others didn t want to watch foreman warming up on the heavy bag because it was just such a spectacle of force and impact ''cal fussman  yeah, you didn t want to believe that was coming in at you  and yet, when they got into the ring to fight, ali basically laid back on the ropes and let foreman throw that at him, all the while saying,  that all you got, george? that all you got?  and a funny line by foreman was after four rounds,  yeah, that s about it  ''and then by the eighth, ali hit him with a few straight punches and down he went  he was just exhausted  but over again, we saw him take tremendous punishment and come back as he aged  you just had a tremendous sense of belief when you followed him  so for me, the idea that he was always asking these questions that were important to ask, that were the most important issues of the day, and then when he stood up to everything that was in front of him with full faith in himself, in my mind that was the definition of a hero  in 2003, esquire magazine was celebrating its 70th anniversary ''it had always been my dream to do a magazine story about muhammad ali, from the time i was a kid  so they sent me out to write this cover story based on reportage in dublin, ireland, where muhammad was in town for the special olympics  he was going to help inaugurate the games  so i went out there and it was one series of experiences after another that were completely surprising to me  because do you know when you have a hero, you often don t want to meet them because they re your hero before you know who they really are  right, and you might encounter the hero with clay feet ''cal fussman  exactly  and suffer the disillusionment and disappointment ''cal fussman  yeah, and you don t want to walk away from your hero disappointed  so i didn t know what was going to happen ''but keep in mind   we should cite this  this is seven years after 1996, the atlanta olympics   when he did something else that i thought was very brave  because at that point, everyone knew he had parkinson s disease  and he stood with the olympic torch in front of the world  the torch is in his shaking hand  he had to put it into the olympic cauldron to get it to light  and for what seemed like an endless amount of time, he couldn t get it in the right place, and his hand is shaking, and it was like the world was holding its collective breath ''and all of a sudden, he got it in the right place  the flame erupted, and so did everybody s heart  and from that point on,  96 to 2003, we hadn t really seen that much about him  so the editors basically said,  tell us, how is he doing?  so i go to the special olympics to meet him ''he s in a hotel, and he knows in advance that he s my childhood hero  he comes through the double doors of his bedroom suite and he s walking kind of slowly, and i just put out my hand to shake his hand  and he just threw out his arms and hugged me with a big embrace  after that, he s moving on really slow, tender steps  and then he kind of slumps down in this cushy leather chair  i take the sofa on the side  and i say to him,  champ, i came here to find out all the wisdom that you ve accumulated in the world   but he doesn t seem to be paying attention  he seems to be paying attention to his right arm, which is trembling back and forth  and now both of his arms are really starting to tremble ''and i m starting to think, what should i do? should i call his wife? and now, not only his arms are trembling but his torso, his legs are shaking, his breaths are coming almost in gasps  and now i m really starting to get nervous  i said,  champ, champ, are you okay?  and then slowly, his head rises to the point where he is at eye level with me  and he looks me in the eye and he says,  scared ya, huh?  and it only got more confusing  it only got more confusing  so the olympics get started, special olympics, and there was one moment when it really hit me  like you asked why was he your hero?''muhammad is going to meet with nelson mandela  muhammad s best friend and photographer, howard bingham, is with us, and muhammad s wife, and i m coming along  we meet mandela, and we re walking to a hotel suite to sit down and talk  and on the way, mandela is saying how when he was imprisoned in his younger days and he would hear news of muhammad ali, how much it inspired him  and i m standing there looking at nelson mandela thinking  hold it  my hero is nelson mandela s hero  and that s when it really hit me what muhammad ali meant to the world ''we had this nice meeting  and then the olympics get started, and ali was there to go around the track in a golf cart and kind of wave to the crowd and just get everything started off on a really high note ''so i m down at the base of the stadium with him, and the golf cart comes out and muhammad slowly gets on  he gets into his seat  howard, his best friend and photographer, gets on the back and he waves me   come on, get on, get on  so i run and i hop on the golf cart and it was an amazing experience  because you re driving around, and there s 80,000 people in croke park  and wherever ali went was that same chant  ali, ali! and it was almost like this energy is coming from the top of the stadium down on us  then ali would put up his hand, and then the energy would get pushed back all the way to the top ''then it would come down again, and so back and forth and back and forth  i was always the one at the top of the stadium screaming, so it was an amazing experience to see the power that he still had  and yet, when we had to leave that day, he needed a wheelchair  so it was like a mystery to me because he had all this power, and yet he was very vulnerable and his body was breaking down  i was just trying to figure this out to write this story, to explain how is muhammad ali doing? it was confounding to me ''because one day we would go out to dinner and after dinner, we re coming out of the restaurant and a huge throng of people is coming ''it s time to get in the car and go  we just can t be avalanched like that  he needs to move fast, and he does  and then, the day after that, he can t speak much above a whisper at that time but he s doing magic tricks for people  when we got back to his home in michigan, i remember he had just taken his medicine for parkinson s disease  we re sitting on the couch  the medicine turned his tongue orange  we re talking and just all of a sudden he falls asleep, and his left leg is jangling into mine  i m thinking, how can i possibly make sense of this?''i can t really describe these contradictions  there s no question i can really ask that s going to unlock this mystery  so i m getting down to the last day that i m scheduled to be with him ''and muhammad s wife, lonnie, says,  you know, you don t work out much anymore, muhammad  why don t you just go with cal to the gym and just do a little workout?  muhammad kind of rolls his eyes  oh, okay, come on  so he takes me over to the gym on the property, and it s not really a gym  it s more like a museum  we walk in and the ring looks like nobody s ever stepped foot in it  there s no smell of sweat  there s exercise equipment all around the ring and it looks like it s just out of boxes  all four walls have mirrors on them, and above the mirrors are photos, great photos, of ali fighting his archrival joe frazier ''there were other photos, too, but those were the ones that really stood out to me  because the trilogy that they fought was like the thrill of my childhood ''it s what i lived for  i knew everything about muhammad ali and joe frazier down to the childhood stories that define their styles in the ring  like for instance, muhammad, when he was a kid, he would have his younger brother, rudy, pick up rocks in the street and throw the rocks at muhammad s head  back then, he was cassius  and as the rock would be approaching his head just about to hit, he would just throw his head back, lean away from it and let the rock slide by  and that was exactly the style he adopted in the ring  he would dance like no other heavyweight ever before him danced ''if you got close enough to throw a punch, he was just going to lean back, make you miss, and then he d hit you like 20 times, faster than a shoeshine guy could buff a pair of shoes ''joe frazier, on the other hand, very different story  short, stocky, and here s where that left hook came from  when he was a kid, he grew up on a farm in beaufort, south carolina  his dad had only one arm  nobody knows the real story, but apparently there had been trouble with some other woman, and some shooting, and so joe s dad only had one arm  and they would work this cross saw back and forth, joe and his dad  joe s dad would use his right arm, and joe would be using his left  so he s just sawing back and forth for years with that left hand ''he had the muscles that are developing as he s going back and forth, back and forth  the power that he developed in this left hand turned into this phenomenal left hook that came out of the side out of nowhere ''it was the only punch that a kid who could move away from rocks in the middle of the street was vulnerable to because you didn t see it coming  all the times, except at the very end of his career that muhammad ali got knocked down, always with a left hook  it was his kryptonite  and here you ve got a guy who is like 5 10 , 205 pounds of relentless kryptonite coming at him  and when ali fought frazier, it was like thunder versus lightning  the thing about it was, when they fought, ali had already refused to go into the army ''he was stripped of his heavyweight championship  the government wouldn t let him fight  the state commissions wouldn t let him fight for three and a half years  he lost the prime of his career ''when he was finally able to come back in 1970, he wasn t as fast  he couldn t dance the way he danced when he was 22 and 23  at this point, he s 28, 29  he d never had anybody like joe frazier coming at him before  so you had on march 8, 1971, thunder versus lightning, never before seen  two undefeated legitimate heavyweight champions confronting each other  frank sinatra, there was a photographer in the front row  everybody had to be ringside for this  the whole world was watching  it was like the sporting event of the century  so what happened, what happened in the first fight anyway is ali started to get in trouble because joe frazier just would not stop ''the left hooks kept coming  ali was able to get into the minds of a lot of his opponents  he tried to get into the mind of joe frazier  frazier would be hitting him with shots and ali would be saying to him,  you can t beat me, i m god!  that would have worked on some other people  joe frazier just looked at him and said,  well, god s gonna get his ass whooped tonight!  he kept throwing punches  and so when ali would get into trouble   and frazier got him into trouble   he had this corner man named drew bundini brown, who was the guy who, when you hear the phrase  float like a butterfly, sting like a bee,  that came from both muhammad and bundini ''they would kind of sing it,  float like a butterfly, sting like a bee  rumble, young man, rumble! ''so when ali got in trouble, bundini would, in the most poetic ways, say things to help lift him up, anything   the world needs you, champ!   go to the well once more! go to the well once more!  almost always, ali would reach inside of him, find whatever was deep in the well, and use it to lift him over the bar  so i m looking at these pictures above the mirrors on the wall, and i m almost hearing bundini s voice in my head   go to the well once more!  and i realized that s what i ve got to do  that is my question, here  in order to write this piece, i ve got to find out what s still in the well ''so i look around the gym and there is a rack of boxing gloves  and i m saying to myself,  you think you should take the risk? ''i don t know  then i said,  what the hell, let me try it   because one of the things that i ve learned as an interviewer is when you get to the end of an interview, that s when you can always ask the toughest question  so i take four gloves off this rack and i put two on muhammad s hands and two on mine  now, actually if people heard the first   installation of our conversation ''cal fussman  yeah  then they know about the story of me fighting against julio c sar ch vez  which begins   just as a side note   with you sitting on the couch eating potato chips berating julio c sar ch vez on tv and your wife saying something along the lines of,  oh, yeah, okay  you re going to fight julio c sar ch vez?  and you re like,  damn right i m gonna fight julio c sar ch vez   and long story short, because you should listen to the long version, you ended up traveling by hook and crook and donkey and everything else to make it happen ''cal fussman  yes, we did  but you did a lot of serious boxing training ''cal fussman  and that s the whole point, here  when i trained, i trained for six months to get in the ring for one round with julio c sar ch vez  and i trained in the exact style of joe frazier  i could do joe frazier so well, i could even sound like joe frazier  so i ve got these gloves on, he s got the gloves on, but i don t come at him  i don t ask to go to the ring  i just start to move toward the heavy bag  smokin  joe had this style where he s like bobbing back and forth, his head moving left to right, and his left hand would be doing like a figure eight in front of his head and his right hand would be figure eighting in front of his jaw  and he s going back and forth, back and forth, back and forth ''he s low, and he s in a crouch and he s just relentlessly pursuing  then he d get close with the left hand saying,  hit me ta, hit me ta   he d be throwing that left hook  so i m in that crouch, i m bobbing and weaving  i m looking at ali out of the corner of my eyes to see what kind of reaction i m going to get  it was like watching his eyebrows arch  it was like watching a sleeping lion awakened by an old, familiar scent  he looks over and he says,  you good!  i hear that and now i m starting to hit into the bag saying,  hit me ta, hit me ta!  i m throwing my left hooks right at it  hit me ta, hit me ta ''ali steps up  and he s throwing left, right, left, right, left right  i said,  you think that s gonna keep me off?  now i m really in a crouch ''hit me ta, hit me ta, hit me ta  he steps in, lefts and rights, lefts and rights, jab, jab, jab, lefts and rights  i come back, and all of a sudden he looks at me in a way that says   okay  so that s your question   slowly, with his left hand, he waves me away from the bag, and he waits until i m away from the bag  then i saw something i never thought i would ever see again  muhammad ali started dancing  he s dancing around the bag  he s moving not like when he was 20, but he still had the rhythm, he still had the grace ''he s moving around the bag, and he s looking at himself in the mirror  as he s looking at himself, you could see his chest come up ''then his head came up, and he s dancing, and he s dancing  then all of a sudden, he stops, pivots, and there were like 40 straight shots right into the bag, really rapid fire  i m in disbelief  his last shot, if the bag had been a heavyweight fighter, he might have knocked him down  i m standing there just staring, don t know what to say  it s hard to process what i ve just seen  you re thinking, no one is going to believe me ''cal fussman  yeah  what? as he s going away from the bag, his legs cross and he starts to go down  i m going  no, no, this is not happening  no, please! and now he s going down, down, down and there are mats on the ground, and he falls on the mats ''now i m thinking,  what did you do, cal? oh, you idiot! why did you do that?  i m paralyzed for a second but then i start to move over to help him get up  before i can reach him, he flips over and he starts doing stomach crunches  then he s doing sit ups  then he s on his back, legs bicycling in the air  then he gets up and he goes over to super leg press  it s on like 250 pounds  he grips it, pushing it back and forth  i said,  champ, you don t have to do this  i seen you, champ  i seen you  don t worry about it  i know what s in the well  ''and he just looked at me and he said,  feels good   and i thought i had pushed him as far as i could, but he had more to give  so after this, we go back to the house and he knew that i wanted his wisdom ''he tells me to sit down at a table outside the kitchen  i m sitting down, and he comes to me with a piece of paper  on this paper, it s just filled with wisdom  i m going down the lines, one after the other, and he points to one in the middle  it says,  god will not place a burden on a man s shoulder knowing that he cannot handle it   and that kind of summed everything up  but for me, the story went a little further  because he went into the kitchen, and he came out with two bowls in his left hand and a quart of ice cream in his right  you know how much i love ice cream, tim ''so i got a chance to sit at a table and have ice cream with my childhood hero  that is my enduring memory  it was just sad to in one minute know that this man who had been with me all my life was not with us anymore  the thing that really pushed me, because i was called by the editor of esquire because the magazine was shipping out on the exact day that muhammad died  so he wanted to hold off the issue and make sure that we represented  esquire had followed ali s career like just about no other magazine  maybe sports illustrated can make the same claim ''so i m sitting there charged with writing this essay of what he meant to me  what really hit me was when i started to think forward  i started to think of all of the kids now  i m wondering, what kind of heroes do they have? do they have a muhammad ali? i don t think so  the reason i don t think so is because we don t have a nelson mandela who saw muhammad ali as a hero  it s just a completely different time  i wondered what this absence might mean for this next generation going forward  who are their heroes? what are they going to get out of it?''it really has pushed me to think, and to think a lot about this millennial generation, which we were laughing about yesterday because everybody says the word  millennial   i tried to look it up  i was like, we need to sort this out  we were at dinner having some wine  and the first article that pops up says,  everyone can agree that millennials are the worst   and the next line was something along the lines of,  but no one can seem to define what exactly a millennial is  ''cal fussman  well, there you go  the amazing thing to me, for some reason   i don t know what it is, and i think you have the same characteristic   certainly you do  i m just starting to see little vibrations of it  where there s an attraction among the millennials to you  i know that because they all come over to me and say,  oh, i heard the podcast that you did with tim ferris  ''so there s like this whole arc of millennials out there that i know are listening to you  they re also starting to come up to me  i really feel for this generation  i feel for them because i don t think they have a muhammad ali  a lot of them were behind bernie sanders  to me, i love seeing bernie out there pounding on the podium  he s in his mid 70s and he s throwing himself into it, and it looked like what could be better than that? you re that age and you re throwing your entire passion into your every day  you can t beat that  but to me, there s a difference between having muhammad ali as a hero and to having bernie sanders as a hero  maybe i m wrong, maybe people will   well, i think there s a difference in stakes, right? and i think that   who was it? cus d amato? i want to say it was cus d amato, the famous trainer of mike tyson starting in the catskill days, who said,  the hero and the coward feel the same thing  the difference is how the hero responds   and i m paraphrasing, of course  but the fact of the matter is if   and i m sure some people will disagree on some level   but the stakes of engaging in the theater of politics for an election are very different from going up against the norms and laws of your country  the stakes are just different ''so you have someone who has put their livelihood where their mouth is, and reputation where their mouth, is to make sacrifices  i think that engenders a certain type of loyalty and respect that is very hard to mimic in the sort of charade of politics as we see a lot of it play out ''but i would say that if there is a problem related to heroes among younger generations right now, i don t think it s because there is a lack of heroes  i think it s because there is so much noise that one needs to sift through to find the signal that is a hero they can believe in  if that makes any sense  instead of having four channels, you have an infinite number of channels in the form of websites and feeds and apps and push notifications, and so on  so it becomes more of a sort of cognitive burden and time consuming task to find someone that one can dedicate their admiration to  does that make any sense?''there are a few exceptions, though  i would say that, as you said, we didn t have all of the details when he was the greatest ''much like all of this sort of came up at the time, for the nature of dr  martin luther king jr    the adultery  people are flawed human beings  they make mistakes  they make bad decisions  but in today s environment, that gets showcased and put into a permanent record that comes up as a top five google result for your name  so i think it s more challenging to have heroes now because they are more clearly human as a result of the abundance of information available ''but i do think there are some out there  elon musk i think is very inspiring, has made great decisions, has all of the flaws that human beings do, of course  but i m cautiously optimistic  i think that there are very few muhammad alis, period, in the world ''cal fussman  well, yeah  what i realized is a lot of this is the time, as you re saying  because when you look at what elon musk is doing and the grandiosity of his vision, and then also to have failed, failed, and then put the craft in the air  so you see, yeah, this is a big timer  and yet, if you were in south dakota at a movie theater and elon musk was ten people in front of you in line to get in, how many people would know who he was?''tim ferriss  i see where you re going  he is sort of unassuming compared to a heavyweight champion of the world, right?''cal fussman  yeah, but to my mind when you think of a hero   this is what i m trying to grapple with, this question ''has the hero changed now so that elon musk is the hero now? but to think of him in the way i think of ali is just foolish because everything s changed  it s entirely possible  i want to actually ask a couple of questions that were sitting on my mind during your story  the first is, do you remember the flavor of ice cream that you had?''cal fussman  vanilla  vanilla? just straight vanilla?''cal fussman  straight vanilla  no decoration on the vanilla?''cal fussman  no, just vanilla ice cream  how did you end up opening and or closing the piece that you wrote, if you remember?''cal fussman  it s interesting because one of the difficulties that you have   and this always happens  you re a writer and they say okay, you ve got 1,500 words ''then you start writing, and then there are 2,500 words on your page and you know that only 1,500 are going to fit in the magazine  they basically pull this thing away from the presses, and there are a certain amount of pages and so there s no extra room for you  the editor said,  this is what i can give you   he s giving you an opportunity to make the most out of it  of course you want to make it even better than that, somehow  so you go overboard and you write a thousand extra words  then you have to look at it, have an editor look at it, and then say okay, what s the 1,500 words that we really want here?''the interesting thing about this piece was exactly what i was just talking about  there was everything that i had seen in the past, and then there were these questions of where does this put the future?''but at the time, it really was an obituary and so it really was a look back  so the thousand words that got cut were the thousand words that were looking ahead  and it basically ended with this point that you just were never going to see this again, ever  it s passed  we don t know where it s going  maybe it is going to the elon musks of the world and people will just have a different definition than i did  it s possible  or if you look at just a broader time scale, right? i mean how many genghis khans are running around? not that many  and if you look at it in a broader, 1,000 year increment, maybe we re just in a lull period between heroes ''cal fussman  that s an interesting point  i guess we re accustomed to   we want heroes  we need heroes  i think human beings need heroes  i think we re hardwired to search for heroes  we find them in real life, we find them in mythology, we find them in religion, or we find them somewhere else  i think we are by nature very hierarchical animals  there s a very interesting book called chimpanzee politics for people who are very interested in looking at the reality of our evolutionary biology  i think we look for rulers and heroes, and it s an important signpost for the mammals we ve evolved to be  do you recall any of the other pieces of wisdom on that paper?''cal fussman  there were a lot that ran in this  what i ve learned  that i really like  my favorite was  the best way to make your dreams come true is to wake up   that was a good one   silence is golden when you can t think of a good answer    the sun is always shining someplace  ''i remember asking him about his definition of evil  and he said,  unfriendliness   i thought that was a really good answer   the more we help others, the more we help ourselves    what you re thinking about you are becoming   oh, how about this for a kicker?  when you re right, nobody remembers  when you re wrong, nobody forgets   dot, dot, dot  especially with the internet ''cal fussman  looking back, i think it captured the experience that i spent with him  so there were two stories  one was the cover story that came out on the 70th anniversary of esquire in 2003  then in january of  04, the  what i ve learned  came out  i think both stories captured the essence of what i wanted to bring out  on top of that, i should point out for me, the best part of the experience was spending a week with my childhood hero ''and at the end of it liking him even more than i did before i met him  he was even more heroic to me for that reason, once i knew him  just seeing the kindness  there was this great obit in time magazine written by a guy named bob lipsyte, who was a new york times columnist for many years and spent 50 years with ali  they did a book in time magazine that was filled with lipsyte s story and photos  the story starts in an interesting way  he and ali are going through an airport  they re late for the plane and lipsyte doesn t think they re going to make it ''as they re moving through the airport, a woman appears and notices ali and pulls out her camera to get a picture  ali stops, goes over to the woman, and makes sure that she has the picture that she wants  lipsyte is thinking,  look, the plane s going to leave   ali said to him,  that was the only time that woman was going to have a chance to have her picture taken with me  i wanted to make sure she got the best picture   i don t know that there are many people who are thinking that way  obviously, part of it gave him internal satisfaction, but he really was thinking a lot about everyone around him  who are other people, heroes or just well known folks who have exceeded your expectations?''cal fussman  i have breakfast every morning with larry king, and so i see him when we re in town together at the same time probably 300 days a year  if you re an interviewer, it s very likely you re going to really look up to him  i ve formed a very close friendship with him and that s something i never could have anticipated  it s beyond what he accomplished in a career  now it s about friendship  so it has gone way beyond that sense of a hero from afar  in fact, i helped him write a book and he inscribed it to me saying,  to cal, my friend, my writer, my hero   when your hero calls you   he was joking, but still he wrote it on the page  it s still on the page ''cal fussman  it s still on the page  it still counts  but that s emblematic that he would write that to me  it tells you about him  it tells you about the kindness and the friendship underneath it  so that s probably my best answer to the question  i have some requests from fans, or i should say listeners, who had a lot of follow up questions for you and of course we ll have to pick and choose  but this is from ozro hepworth  ask him if he ll talk about the time in brazil he used a camera under his shirt as a fake gun to scare off some guys  is that a real thing?''cal fussman  how did he know?''tim ferriss  he said,  i heard the story from someone who knows him pretty well  i would love to hear about it via cal fussman storytelling style  ''cal fussman  oh, man  wow  let s see  my fans are everywhere, man  eyes and ears in all corners ''cal fussman  you know what? that s pretty impressive  okay  this is early, i believe, 1994, february carnival, rio de janeiro  carnevale ''cal fussman  my wife is brazilian  i met her headed to a beach near the equator eight years before this carnival  the bus story that we talked about in part one ''cal fussman  right  and so we get a chance to go back to carnival where we re going to dance in the samba parade and spangles and feathers at 3 00 in the morning in front of the huge crowds  it s like a fantasy  custom thong for yourself, i m assuming?''cal fussman  when you join a samba school   they call them samba schools   various neighborhoods all band together and they compete against each other  so when an outsider comes in, you go to one of the samba schools and you wear their regalia  but it s all spangles and feathers no matter what  when it comes to the beautiful women, there s not too many spangles and feathers to be seen  it s just the beautiful women  this is a wonderful experience  my wife couldn t resist  she always wanted to dance in the samba school  she was five months pregnant at the time so it was probably not the best of times for her to be flying halfway around the world and dancing at 3 00 in the morning  up on some float potentially, who knows?''cal fussman  yeah, we weren t on a float  we were following the floats  we had a great time  it was a blast  the thing about the way i traveled was i always liked to live with the people  so the people that brought us into this samba school lived in a favela, which is in the mountains overlooking the city  very poor, typically  cobbled together electricity, oftentimes  if you haven t seen the city of god, ciudad de dios, i think it is, check it out  that will give you a pretty good glimpse ''cal fussman  some of the favelas are actually decent places to live  it s not all like you re living on a dirt floor  people figure out how to cobble electricity ''this area wasn t an intensely poor area, but it s dangerous to be moving around on the streets  but look, we were in a group of people from this area  i felt completely safe because when you re with the people, you re with the people  safety in numbers with the locals ''cal fussman  the locals, exactly  so we go through the dance, it s a really great time  the music, the crowd, the sheer pageantry of the whole thing  we re starting to walk back home  it s like 3 00 or 4 00 in the morning  now, right around that time we had heard of   i hope i m pronouncing it right  it s been awhile now  but the word was  ahasdao   which was   what would happen is there are a lot of bridges in rio that people can walk over ''what young toughs and thugs would do is they would line both sides of the bridge and just be like looking over the water casually and waiting for an appropriate moment where everybody would just attack somebody or a group of people, to either steal something or you can get beat up  stuff that wasn t so good is going to happen to you  we d heard about this  we knew it was kind of a dangerous time and we were staying in a place that while it was not dangerous on that street, we were still walking through dangerous places to get there  so it s really early in the morning, and we re walking across this bridge ''my wife is brazilian, and she looks brazilian  i do not look brazilian  i m like a gringo  it s the middle of february and at that point, i m back in new york  it s winter and i m looking really white  ghostly ''cal fussman  i wouldn t say ghostly  come on, tim, give me a break  just trying to expand my adjectives  sorry ''cal fussman  i know that, okay, if they re going to be looking to get somebody, they re coming after me  so we re all walking and now i m seeing these lines of people on the side, and i can see that they re looking over at us  i immediately know this is not good ''because we re in the middle of a fairly long bridge and we ve got like a half a mile to get to the other side where at least you could run or do something  there s nowhere for us to go except over the side and take a long tumble into the water  it s like an indiana jones and the temple of doom situation ''cal fussman  it was really scary  it s interesting because when i think back on it, i have some measure of pride because there are just certain moments where you know, okay, bad shit s gonna happen  what am i going to do? you have no time to think  so i immediately say to my wife, who really understands what s going to happen even far better to me  i say,  you stay toward the middle but get away from me,  because i know they re coming after me ''i don t know what s going to happen  i may get thrown off the side, i may get pummeled  who was to know? but i m just thinking if i could have them all turn on me, then my wife and my kid are going to be able to get away  so i move away and she is really nervous  i just said,  walk as fast as you can to get to the other side   i m going to slow it down and have their focus on me  in the meantime, one of the guys that was in our neighborhood, toco   god bless him   he has stopped to take a piss under the bridge  this piss saved my life  because what happened was, after he was done he came back up to the bridge and then he saw from behind what was going to happen ''and he just came running, shouted to a few people and went running, and literally as everybody was about to turn on me   and the other thing about it i should point out, this is right after i fought julio c sar ch vez  so i m also in the back of my mind saying the first guy, i can hit him  maybe if he goes down, maybe it ll stop things for a second  or maybe they re all just going to mow me down  but there were a lot of men looking, and they re coming after me  no shortage of firearms in brazil, either ''cal fussman  you know what? i don t even think it was a matter of that because the setup was you didn t need it ''all you had to do was just get 50 people to line up the side of a bridge and then wait for a moment of attack, and then attack  a gringo tourist dressed in spangles and feathers, what s he gonna do?''tim ferriss  i m sorry  just the sheer shock of some gringo in spangles and feathers knocking out the first guy would have been quite something  but please continue ''cal fussman  okay  so at this point, there s two thoughts  the first thought is, this could be it for me, but at least my wife and my son get out of here  so now i ve slowed it down  i m seeing she s moving really fast away  okay, now i m waiting for the onslaught  now, in the meantime, toco sees what s going on, calls a few of his friends and he just sprints with his hand inside his shirt  he and his buddies, they literally surround me and they just stop the group ''he s a guy who s looking like he s al capone, like hey, i ve got some serious firepower here  i m going to mow you all down if you don t leave him alone  he s with us  then there s this fear among the crowd because we don t know what toco s got under there  who knows?''cal fussman  but he s got something  toco says,  just back off, let us get to the other side of the bridge, we re not going to have any problems  otherwise, there s going to be a lot of problems   and these guys, just everybody s staring at what s inside toco s shirt  and so the others just remained still while i get to the other side  i m walking straight but toco and the others are walking backward, making sure nobody s   with his hand in his shirt the whole time ''we get to the other side and i said,  man, i didn t know you took a gun   and he pulled out a camera  man, what a bluff ''cal fussman  yeah  i owe my life to him and that quick bathroom stop and the camera  how did these people hear this story?''tim ferriss  i have no idea  you can ask ozro,  can tell you more  you might be listening, ozro, so let cal know  one more and then perhaps we ll have to be continued  it s from a friend of mine, actually, a chef   ask about his acceptance speech for the jbf  ''cal fussman  james beard foundation  that was something i didn t expect  man, it s amazing  it s like the oscars for food ''cal fussman  yeah, it s like the oscars for food and it was in a beautiful setting with thousands of people in new york  the thing about the james beard award is there are a lot of awards given out during these ceremonies  in the beginning people are paying attention, but then you get everybody coming up and you re warned  you ve got three minutes  you win an award, like no more than 180 seconds up behind the mic  everybody knows there are a lot of awards and if people talk for 20 minutes, you re not going to get out of there until 4 00 in the morning  so you re told  three minutes, that s it ''as the evening is going and more and more awards, and people are going up and i don t want to make fun of it but when you get people getting up and saying i d really like to thank aunt penelope for showing me how to skin a cucumber  like it s over and over and over again  a thousand variations of aunt penelope ''cal fussman  yeah, exactly  and so naturally, the crowd s attention is going to start to drift away  then once it starts to drift, it s just not coming back  unless ted allen gets an award, a well known tv personality, people will  oh, there s ted allen, and there will be a silence  but if you re going through categories where only a few people know the person who has just won, the thing is just going on and on and on and now the whole crowd is having a good time at their table  everybody s talking and having a great time but nobody s paying attention to aunt penelope no more ''so here it is, i ve just written this story that took me ten years to write about being the sommelier at windows in the world at the top of the world trade center just before the planes hit and the twin towers go down  it takes me ten years to be able to write this story  i was so traumatized  and i win the award for best essay  the award is called, i hear my name, and i go up to the stage to give my speech  and i look out and nobody is paying attention  there must be like three or four thousand people there in this grand setting  nobody  having a thousand conversations ''cal fussman  that s right  i cannot describe all of the pain that i had to go through to get this piece out of me  and here i am, you get your medal and then you re going up to speak ''i m looking out at this crowd and i can t speak out into that crowd because i feel like i ve got something important to say that goes back to 9 11, and there s nobody out there listening that i can see  so i just get behind the podium and i don t say anything  15 seconds pass, 30 seconds pass  there s a woman over on the side, the one who s saying,  three minutes, three minutes   i ve just gone like 30 seconds and i haven t said a word  45 seconds, a minute  now you can start to see some people are saying what s going on? why isn t he talking about his aunt penelope?''then, after it must have been a minute, maybe a minute and a half, ted allen stands up and in the crowd, throws his arm up like no!''like, cal must speak! he didn t say that but something like that  a hush comes over the crowd, and still i said i am not going to say a word until there is complete silence in this place  and i just wait, and i wait and my three minutes is all up  now there are people all around with their arms up saying,  let him speak! let him speak!  then i spoke  the beauty of the experience   because i m only now understanding that speaking was something that i was born to do ''when i look back on those moments, like that moment tells me yeah, you were born to do this  because afterward, a chef like paul bartolotta, who has a great italian restaurant, had it at the win for many years, has won james beard awards for himself, came over to me and he just said,  you took back the crowd   at the time, i didn t understand it  but now that i m starting to give speeches, now it makes sense  yeah, i do have this and i have to use it  it would be terrible for me not to use it  i m supposed to use it  but that was only like a flicker, and it was about five years after that before i started talking, but it was there  some more questions when we get back from festivities?''cal fussman  a hundred percent  you know, we could spend all tomorrow talking if you want  i ve got this guy who s managing me now, kevin the manager  and he says,  cal, you go on and you do these three and a half hour podcasts, like three and a half hours  do you realize how long that is?  and then i said to him,  kevin, it was fun  why wouldn t i?  so we can talk all tomorrow  alright, fantastic   inaudible  barrel sauna use, which i ll fill people in on, perhaps  one of my newest distractions saviors but to be continued  this is great fun and we will continue ''all right  this is round two picking up in the a m  we have two mugs full of yerba mate tea and i thought we would tackle some questions from listeners  one we can start with is nick styman  which interview in his career went worst? discuss the aftermath ''cal fussman  okay, there s a good story to that one  i don t know if many people remember a guy named william buckley  he was an incredible intellect who was at the foundation of the conservative party  but he had a tv show back in the  60s that was just fantastic  this guy had an amazing intellect and a vocabulary that you d only dream of  i don t know why but he was the only person i have ever been frightened to interview ''just because   well, i ll tell you why  back in the  60s, he challenged robert kennedy to a debate on tv on his show  robert kennedy wouldn t go  so buckley comes on the next show and he spoke in this kind of effete way, and he basically says,  well, you know, i invited robert kennedy to come and debate me  he has refused  this is clearly a case of the baloney rejecting the grinder   what a line, wow ''cal fussman  he was like that all the time  he could take you apart if he wanted to just with the magnificence of his language  and i don t know what it was but i was really scared ''look, the guy was way older than me  he had seen much more than me  how old were you at the time? just roughly ''cal fussman  oh, let s see  probably late 30s, early 40s?''tim ferriss  so not totally green ''cal fussman  no, that s the point  that s the point  i had no reason to fear him  i d already done many  what i ve learned  interviews  i d already met a lot of famous people, people who had done big things  but i was just scared  so i said to myself, you ve really got to be prepared for this interview like no other interview before  and so i did all my research  i read and read and read, and i watched what i could of him  for two days before the interview, i stopped eating  was this part of your performance enhancement plan or was that just nerves?''cal fussman  i just wanted to be laser focused when i walked in there  like a hawk ''cal fussman  that s right  or hunting like a peregrine falcon  they ll starve to make their senses more acute, okay ''cal fussman  that s exactly it  i wanted my senses to be laser focused when i walked in there  there was no way that this guy   food was going to throw you off ''cal fussman  i m outside of his apartment in new york like a half an hour early  i m just pacing back and forth  i m like, there s no way he s going to take you apart  you re gonna stay with him, cal  this guy is amazing but you re going to stay with him  finally, the appointed hour arrives  it s like 11 00 in the morning  i go and i knock on his door  the door swings open, and he throws his arms out wide and he says,  welcome to my home  ''and then he starts rubbing his hands together and he says, with a big smile on his face,  a little scotch?  now i m screwed  now i m screwed because when i traveled around the world, if you offered me something to eat or something to drink, i drank it or i ate it  i did some crazy stuff  i remember going to the nile for the first time and just walking up and drinking out of it just to say, okay, i m at one with you here  and the next three days, i couldn t leave my hotel room  i was over the toilet  but that was my mentality  if you serve it, i have ultimate respect  i will eat it or drink it ''so now he s saying,  have this scotch   i know if i put this scotch to my lips, within 20 minutes i m going to be slurring my words or out of it because i m just too clean for it  so i looked at him, and i said   god, i regret it  it gives me shivers just to repeat it  i said,  how about a little water?  and he looks at me and his nose goes up in the air and he says,  oh   and in that  oh  was,  it s going to be that kind of interview, is it?  and the interview was done  it was just   i had not respected him  look, my whole way of interviewing is i m going to make you feel like you re at home ''so here s a guy who opened the door to his home, threw out his arms to embrace me, offered me   who knows   probably a 50 year old single malt and i just said no  i couldn t even make him feel at home in his home  we sit down and in fairness to myself, when i went back and listened to the interview, it wasn t that bad  but it could have been great  right, you know how much better it could have been ''cal fussman  yeah  because i just set it off on such a wrong note, and it ended way earlier than it should have ended  i walked away saying, you will never, ever do that again  that is a mistake you never should have made and i hope you learned your lesson ''so what happened in the aftermath is a good part of that question  because okay, i m getting ready to hand the piece in and i m just making it work  it s one of those, if you re a pole vaulter and you re just getting over the bar  just barely clearing it ''cal fussman  yeah, and it s like shaking  like you ve nicked it and it s shaking  but i feel, as i m about to hand it in, that it s still there and i m coming down and i m going to have a soft landing here  so phew  and i get a phone call, and it s bad news, cal, bad news  it s from the editor  what s going on? well, william buckley had written a piece for esquire like 30 or 40 years ago ''there were some problems with it and a legal agreement was made between william buckley and esquire that piece would never again run  it would never be republished  and esquire had just put out a huge book of great stories  oh, including his piece ''cal fussman  because what happened was there had been maybe eight editors in between the time that happened  too many regime changes ''cal fussman  yeah, and nobody knew about this  only buckley and his lawyers knew and they basically said,  hey, get that book off the racks  you can t do this   so they said there s just no way we can run the interview  i got a reprieve  you got a reprieve and a pardon at the last minute ''cal fussman  that s right  i got a last minute pardon  the lesson was the truly important thing because i will never, ever go into an interview nervous because it serves no purpose  it only hurts you  were there points in the future when you felt the involuntary nerves kicking in and if so, what would you say to yourself?''cal fussman  no, because the experience scarred me  remember the scotch? now, i ll take ice cream into interviews  so you skipped the peregrine falcon prep after that ''cal fussman  look, do the prep  not the prep, but the fasting approach ''cal fussman  yeah, i mean, it s just ridiculous  because if you re going intense, you re going to transmit that tenseness into the interview, into the person, into the subject  look, there are a lot of interviewers who do things different ways  i just did a piece with jorge ramos, the univision anchor who donald trump pitched out of the interview in iowa awhile back ''he has a completely different approach  he goes into the interview as if it s a war  because a lot of the people that he s interviewing could have been dictators, or presidents who took power in unscrupulous ways  he knows he may only have a few minutes and he may be getting thrown out  so he s going to come at them with the toughest questions right from the start  biggest left hook, right at the bell of the first round ''cal fussman  that s right  and he s had a great career out of it  but look, his background was completely different from mine because he grew up in mexico where basically the media was censored, so he was a reaction to that ''everything he does is a reaction to censorship  it s a reaction to people having power and taking advantage of those who don t have it  he sees journalism as more than just asking a question  he sees it as defending people  i really don t go into an interview to defend anybody  in fact, it s kind of interesting because some people say, what happens when you get people who lie to you? i say, the way i write, it s impossible for somebody to lie to me because i write in other people s words ''so if they lie to me, their lie is going to be printed on the page exactly the way they told it  so basically, the truth is, they re a liar  because anybody who knows the truth is going to know that they lied  so very, very different styles  very different styles  we were talking yesterday about some prep that i was doing for an interview where i wanted to watch a movie  we ended up watching a good part of it together  but i was nervous that i wouldn t have the chance to see it beforehand, due to some technological issues  you mentioned that, for instance, larry king doesn t want to know anything about   and feel free to add to this   say, a given movie that s coming out that a guest is a part of because he wants to, i suppose, see it with fresh eyes and ask the questions that a beginner might ask, or someone who s unfamiliar with it  how does your style differ from, say, larry s? of course, you spend a lot of time with larry ''cal fussman  yeah  larry s basic idea is, i am thinking like the person who s listening ''they haven t seen the movie  they haven t gotten a chance to get a preview so why should i, larry king, be in the position to tell them what happens? better for him to put   oh, there s molly  molly s awake now, guys  she was sedated yesterday but she s full of beans today  i will close that door if she continues her home defense against squirrels and butterflies  sorry, cal ''cal fussman  so larry s basic feeling is hey, i am going to talk to this person who made the movie, or was in the movie, or who wrote the book as if i just sat next to them on an airplane seat  oh, you wrote that book? what s it about? and then let the conversation go from there  that s a great strategy because it s very natural and it allows the person to be just as natural ''i ve gone both ways  in fact, i don t really follow pop culture that much and certainly when i moved out to los angeles in  08, rarely followed it before then  once you re in la, it s hard to not be part of the pop culture because it s all around you  esquire, as soon as i moved out there, they came up with a pretty funny idea, knowing that i didn t know much about current movies  they hatched a plan to send me out to do a cover story but the only thing they told me was,  we just want you to go out and do a story about a guy  his name is gerry  ''i said,  what else?  that s it, just  his name is gerry   and they gave me his address  such a setup ''cal fussman  not only that but they told me,  look, it s just a short interview  don t sweat it  his name s gerry  just go out and talk to him for a few minutes and come back and write something up   it didn t seem like a big trick to me  in the meantime, gerard butler, the actor, is waiting in his house and he s appeared in a few movies at this point, one of which was 300  another one was phantom of the opera  i hadn t seen either of those movies and i had no idea who he was  he is sitting at home getting his first cover story for esquire  he s consented to a three hour interview  a few minutes ''cal fussman  yeah, i m going in a few minutes for gerry and he s thinking  okay, cover story, esquire  so i knock on the door and i m like,  hey, is gerry here?  and then i said,  to be honest, i have no idea who you are but the magazine has sent me to interview you for a few minutes   h e s looking at me and his eyes are squinting, like this guy s putting me on  this guy s putting me on  and i said,  no, no, no  really i have no idea who you are   he s caught between the squinting of the eyes and then there s a smile on his face because he s an actor who can go with it  so he wants to go with it but he s wary  understandably ''cal fussman  this is a setup, this is a setup  and he keeps looking for that little string to pull that s going to take the garment and just unravel it and prove that i m an imposter  but there s nothing he can do because i have no idea who this guy is  i said to him,  the good thing about this is for ten years i ve traveled around the world and i would just get on trains and sit next to people, and we d just go and get a chance to meet each other  so why don t we just approach it like that?  so he s  okay, okay   i said,  where are you from?  just that question, like i don t believe you, i don t believe it, i don t believe this ''then he starts telling me he s from paisley in scotland  i think, at first, i couldn t tell if it was australia, is it england, is it scotland?''tim ferriss  the accent ''cal fussman  yeah  then i said,  scotland?  and he says  yeah, yeah, yeah   then he starts giving me his background and it s only about 20 minutes into the interview where it comes out  and then i started to act  i said,  oh, you re an actor?  and he says,  this is just the biggest bunch of malarkey  i know you re a film buff, this whole thing is being recorded to put me on   i said,  no, gerry, i have no idea who you are   and now the rest of this interview, he s like trying to prove to me that he is a world class actor  poor guy ''cal fussman  the amazing thing about it was we re talking and talking, and still it hasn t occurred to me that this is a cover story  i still think this is   a little interview  a few minutes with gerry ''cal fussman  yeah  so at a certain point we take a little break, and he says,  you need to use the bathroom? use the one off my bedroom  here, i ll show you   we start walking into his bedroom and there is an esquire on a nightstand, and it s got megan fox, the actress, on the cover  he makes this offhand comment, like   geez, why would they want to put me on the cover of esquire when you can have megan fox?  and then it hits me  oh, my god, i ve got to write a cover story about this  oh, no  so we sat back down and i said  alright, gerry   let s shift gears here ''cal fussman   what movies were you in?  he said something like,  really?  he brings up, he says well   this was the topper  he says,  i was in 300   and i haven t seen it  i said,  300, you know, i remember seeing   think i saw a poster of that movie  it was these kind of gladiator guys, and i remember a beard   and gerry says,  that was me! that was me!  we re talking about 300 and he says,  in this issue with megan fox on the cover, it also had a story,  the 75 movies that every man must see   so he says,  i ll show you   and he picks up this issue and he says,  i guarantee you 300 is one of the 75 movies that every man must see  i ll show you  ''he opens it up to the story  he goes on page one and he s looking   these movies are pretty good   he gets to page two   yeah, that is really good   and he s not seeing 300  he turns the page and he says,  fuckers!  he turns the next page   fuck! fuck!  then he gets to the last page  it s not there  he s like,  fuck! how could they not put 300 in here?  and i m saying okay, okay, what else are we in? he said,  phantom of the opera   come on, gerry  you can t sing like that  i saw that broadway show  i got roped into it  i don t like musicals but my wife does and so we went  like you can t sing like that   i was the phantom! ''and so the whole interview is going on where he s trying to prove to me that he s an actor and belongs on the cover of esquire  and we have a great time  true to the actual beginning of the interview where i said to him,  look, i sit down on trains with people and they take me home   at the end of the interview he s saying,  hey, you want to use my big screen? come back anytime   like we re tight  it s been a great time  i m getting ready to leave, and he disappears  and right before i leave, the house fills with music from phantom of the opera  he comes down and he starts singing, note for note, to the music  and i said,  okay, gerry  i know who you are   wow ''cal fussman  so there was a case where i had not a clue   not a clue   who i was interviewing and it works, just being natural  that would work for you  also not for all interviewers, right? given your background, in the same way that perhaps if you went into a war conflict interview format where you had three minutes to hit someone with a left hook, you might not be as adaptable as the univision interviewer, right? that format, the stranger on the train scenario, is something you ve very well adapted to take advantage of ''cal fussman  you know, it s interesting  jorge ramos was telling me a story  the only time that he actually got thrown out of an interview or pushed away before donald trump was with fidel castro  and it was a very tricky situation he was in, and castro knew it  castro knew who he was ''so they re at a conference, and jorge manages to get next to castro, and he s got his mic and he starts asking him questions  what castro did was put his arm around jorge  for photos and whatnot?''cal fussman  because the camera is in on this  and so the look now is that you re pals  which, if you re jorge, you do not want to be seen as pals with   that s clever, though, on the part of fidel ''cal fussman  right  so jorge has got to come back at him and manage to wriggle away  to wriggle away like a toddler ''cal fussman  wriggle away and then hit him with a tough question, at which point one of castro s bodyguards elbowed him away like, out, this is over  i never have to think like that because my feeling is if somebody s going to feel comfortable with me, then i ll get to the deep, eternal truths ''i don t want to push them back or off guard, or make them nervous or make them think about what they have to say  so it s completely different styles  hence, the scotch rule ''cal fussman  yeah, hence the scotch rule  there are, for people who are wondering, and there are many questions that popped up about questions since that s what many people associate you with, good questions  and i feel like i should mention that there are very contrasting styles, even very different from both larry s approach, your approach, and jorge ramos  approach, such as james lipton, inside the actor s studio  i ve spent time with some of his researchers who i ve paid to look at past transcripts of my podcasts to try to help me improve  but the format is completely different  because in the case of, say, james lipton, i believe he knows the answer to every question he s going to ask ''there s a tremendous amount of in depth research and prep that goes into it  for me personally, it really kind of depends on the guest and the circumstances  some are really, really deeply researched, particularly if i m nervous  then others, i m coming in relatively blind because i feel like it s a complex enough subject that i want to have myself in the shoes of the majority of the people listening, if that makes sense, like physics or mathematics or something like that  who are some interviewers that you greatly admire, alive or dead, besides larry?''cal fussman  there are very few good interviewers that i don t admire  this conversation is kind of explaining it all  they were all completely different so that when i look at them, i see what they re doing, i see how they re doing it ''i admire barbara walters and i know that she has scripted her interviews, a little different from lipton because she doesn t know what s coming  but she s got question no  1, question no  2, question no  3  she has story boarded her interviews from start to finish, and meticulously  there s a progression  there s an arc ''cal fussman  i can see how she makes it work for her  charlie rose, the research that he does is absolutely fantastic  the interesting thing about charlie rose is when he s interviewing somebody, you think like he s on almost an equal level of intelligence or material as the person that he s interviewing  that works great for him ''matt lauer is a master at getting people to feel comfortable  i know where this comes from because i interviewed him  when he was a kid, he worked in a men s shop  he said,  when you re a salesman, you have to observe the person coming in through the door, see what they re looking at, what s the right time to approach, when is it time to back off   all of that translates into his interviews and you can see why he makes people feel so comfortable  it came from that clothing store  same story, different background with barbara walters, right? you were mentioning this to me yesterday  if you d elaborate on that for a second, also, just as another example of how the background forms the interviewer?''cal fussman  with barbara walters, her dad owned a famous nightclub in new york called the latin quarter  so all the famous celebrities were in this place night after night  she was sitting and talking with them as if they were friends  that allowed her, later on in life, to have that same vibe in her conversations with people while she interviewed them, because she was just accustomed to sitting next to them and casually talking to them  if you don t have that experience, you might be put off  you might be a little nervous  and that might be something you have to overcome by repeatedly doing it ''but probably in her case, the first time she sat in on a celebrity interview, it was not much different from being at her dad s nightclub  for someone who doesn t have   i don t want people to get the impression that you have to have this extensive childhood experience with something or another to become a good interviewer, because i don t think that s the case, necessarily  maybe i m missing something in my own background  there are a number of questions to this effect  we ve chatted about this a little bit  but for instance, here s a question from david dronet, what are the top three specific questions he asks most often during interviews that he finds are the most revealing?''now, i suspect i know what part of your answer will be to this  but the two that i would offer for people who are opening an interview and are really nervous, one was what you asked   where you from? very simple  the other one that seems to buy a lot of time for me in my experience if i just don t know where to go or where to start, i ll say  tell me the story of how you became x, an actor or whatever ''you ve immediately bought yourself probably five minutes of time to figure out what your next move is, and you ll get something in the answer that will help you figure out your next move  but how would you answer this question, because i m sure you get some variation of this question all the time ''cal fussman  the big thing that i m noticing from the people who ask this question, because once i started to speak, this question kept coming up again and again  it s like, what s the holy grail of questions, here, so i could use them? i always say it s not like there s a holy grail of questions  look, i come prepared  i ve got like 200 questions in my mind when i show up for an interview because i ve thought about them  i ve written them down and then i ve ripped them up  the thing is, it s not that first question that i m really dependent on ''that first question is just opening the door  then the answer is going to spark my second question  and that s going to take me down a flight of steps, like deeper into the person s soul  and then when they answer the second question, that s going to bring up a third question  by the sixth answer, maybe that s where i wanted to go with my first question  so it s a process  it s not a use this and you will be successful, too  it s not an incantation?''cal fussman  yeah  it s also filled with curiosity  because what you re doing is you re just listening to see where the answers take you ''it s the answers that are going to take you where you want to go  the questions are there just to open the doors for the answers  so relying on one question to get you to the bottom of something is something i wouldn t do  but you know what? that s a good question for jorge ramos because he s had to think really carefully  if he knows i ve only got five minutes with this president of a latin american country, and he s got to ask something that s going to get a response that everybody talks about, he might ask a question like, how much did your house cost? then if the person says well, i don t know  you don t know how much your house costs?''tim ferriss  any answer is an answer, in that case  i won t answer that tells you quite a lot  the mask tells you more than what s underneath the mask ''cal fussman  that s what he s working in  he s really thinking hard about what he s going to ask, knowing that he doesn t have much time and also knowing that he s there for the people  right  this is a point that i think about quite a lot but in the converse way  meaning, i ll have guests on who are known or have been known at some point for some type of scandal  if you re in the public eye long enough, eventually something s going to come up  you re going to make a misstep, you re going to say something stupid  and there are some fans   not a lot   who are like, why didn t you ask him about this? why didn t you ask her about that? in my case, i do have a lot of time  i have two to three hours to uncover, in my particular format, tactics and tools and so on ''so if i ask how much did your house cost? that s the equivalent of not accepting the scotch times a hundred  they ll go, oh, it s one of these, and the doors get shut  that s effectively the end of the interview, even if it lasts another two hours  they will not give me anything they wouldn t give a stranger who s potentially hostile  so it s a completely different style of interviewing ''cal fussman  but you know what? the way i would approach that is not with a direct question, but just by allowing the conversation to circle around that area and invite him or her to explain the scandal through that and then you can be into it ''best example i can give you about that is when larry king was just getting started in miami on radio  he was sitting at a table with a friend of his at the time, jackie gleason, honeymooners?''tim ferriss  yeah, for sure ''cal fussman  so they had become friends  jackie had asked this question around the table, what s impossible? i guess there was a doctor at the table who said,  we ll never have artificial blood   and it gets to larry, and larry says,  what s impossible? i have a three hour radio show  getting frank sinatra to appear on my radio show, that s impossible   and jackie gleason pointed to him and said,  you got it   as it turned out, frank had been doing a concert or a series of concerts and lost his voice and needed to be replaced one night ''he called jackie, and he said,  hey, jackie, can you go on and do a comedy bit for me so that nobody s upset?  frank says,  i owe you one   so after that conversation with larry and the others, jackie calls up frank and says,  hey, frank  this is the one  there s this kid, larry king  he s just starting out in radio, miami beach  he s got a three hour show  i need you to go on for three hours   frank says,  you want it? you got it   now, nobody can believe it  this is like a little radio station  at the time, i m imagining that sinatra is the biggest of the big ''cal fussman  yeah  not only that, but frank, as his pr guy points out, the public relations guy is basically employed to say no to all these requests like this  i m very familiar ''cal fussman  the people at the radio station can t believe it because larry says,  i got frank sinatra coming in friday night,  or whatever night it was and the radio wants to do all this publicity  they say,  are you sure he s gonna show?  this is a little station  larry king is not big time  this is what made larry king big time  the radio station is calling over to where frank is staying, asking just to get a confirmation  no response, no response, no response  the show was on at 9 00  finally, at two minutes to 9 00, frank comes through the door with his publicist ''and the publicist pulls larry aside and says,  i don t know how you got this because my job is to not let this happen  but he said he wants to do it  okay, i m just telling you one thing ''do not ask about the kidnapping of his son, just don t   and larry is young and so grateful   whatever you say, whatever you say  the interview starts, and larry is dumbfounded  so he says to frank   talk about starting an interview   he says to frank   where are you from? no, i m just kidding ''cal fussman  no, even better  he says,  why are you here?  frank explained, and larry didn t even know the back story  so frank is having to explain to him,  gleason substituted for me and i owed him one  then he said  frank, this is the one  and so i m here   the interview starts going, and an hour passes or whatever  and midway into the interview, frank is feeling very comfortable  larry says to him,  do you feel, frank, you ve ever gotten a bum rap? ''frank says,  absolutely  in the case of my son getting kidnapped   and then he just goes into the whole story  so larry didn t ask the question directly  he just made frank feel at home  so that is more where i line up, as opposed to the style of going in there and saying we ve got sinatra  corner the wild beast ''cal fussman  yeah  the camera s in front of him  if we ask him about it and he doesn t want to answer, we re still going to get his reaction  i don t go that way  it s also, from my perspective, a very mercenary way of doing things and a very transactional away  contrasted with if you take the approach that larry did, he s developing friendships, not just good tape, over time ''cal fussman  exactly  at least, i would say, a third of the guests that i ve had on the podcast came as recommendations from other guests and introductions  that wouldn t happen if i had a transactional  gotcha  type of approach  and just to reiterate what you said, the exact, same experience is something i ve had on at least two dozen of my interviews  in the sense that i always ask guests beforehand, because the show is not about making people look bad  it s about tactics and routines and habits and all the stuff that people can use ''i ll ask,  is there anything you really don t want to talk about or prefer not to talk about?  and not often, but every once in a while somebody will say i really don t want to talk about x  if i make them feel comfortable, and if i do one thing which neil strauss, who is a very good writer and very accomplished interviewer for rolling stone and new york times, he said to me,  if you want them to be vulnerable, be vulnerable yourself  give up some details of your life that are very vulnerable   so i made that a habit  i d say in about half of the cases, they end up talking about exactly the thing they said they didn t want to talk about  they bring it up themselves ''cal fussman  it only makes sense because when people feel comfortable, then they re going to speak normally  they re going to forget they re being interviewed  later on in life, frank actually wrote larry a note that said,  you make the cameras disappear   i think that s what you, as an interviewer, want to do  you want to make people forget they re being interviewed and just speak with you naturally  now, that s just my style  other people, they want it to be known it s an interview ''if you show up with a pad in front of you and cameras, then it s an interview  the pad is going to tell the person that is across from you, there are questions written down  this is an interview  be advised  so that s just something i would never, never do but that s just me  that s just my style  you mentioned that you think about the questions, write down the questions, then tear them up  i m curious about this  do you review a list of questions and then the day before, or before you walk into someone s house, just tear it up into little shreds and throw it in a wastebasket? what does your process look like for adding the ammo to your brain?''cal fussman  it s a matter of you do your research  then there s a period of curiosity where you ve taken in all this information, and now what are you curious about?''so you just start writing down questions  for me, it comes very easily  i ll just start writing, writing, writing and then pages will be filled up  the way i look at it, it s almost like i m putting songs in a jukebox and the questions are my songs  i m just going to have these songs in there  they re in my head  i know the words to the songs  i can sing the songs  then i rip them up  it s more of like a ceremonial act  the questions are no longer on paper  they re in my head  so when i go into the interview, interesting things start happening  no  1, because all these questions are in my head, i m never at a loss for a question ''i ve talked to some writers who say what happens when you run out of questions? well, i don t because my jukebox is filled  but more than that, what will happen is i ll ask a question, and i ll get a response and then i m working off the responses  but oftentimes, the response will lead to a question i ve already thought of  so it s like they re hitting the jukebox and they re playing the music  they re getting the question that they want because that s where they were going  right, they used the proper cue, in a sense ''cal fussman  right  so my mind was prepared to ask them the question that they wanted to hear to make them more comfortable ''my style   and other people can try it and see if it works for them  but there s something relaxing about it to me  i ve interviewed people who have shows on tv where they have to interview people, and i come in without any questions or pad  and you can see this shocked look on their faces  you don t write down your questions? because they might feel like, what will i do on camera if i can t think of a question? it might look bad  having that pad there is a safety net  but once you do it this way a few times, you re free  neil does the same thing, neil strauss  i don t think he tears them up but he folds it up and puts it in his pocket and doesn t look at it at all ''and i think if i were to underscore something that you both have in common, it s that you re very good at getting people to open up about things that they would be disinclined to open up about normally in an interview  i think that s a big part of it  it s like if you have a camera with a flashing red light, people put on their body armor  the more you can make it a conversation as opposed to an interview, like you said, if you can remove the symptoms of an interview so to speak, the pad of paper, the flashing lights, the more naturally people will engage with you and the more they will share ''cal fussman  now you re getting into oprah territory  imagine this  you ve got the flashing lights, you ve got an audience that s reacting, and then you ve got a subject on the couch  and she is getting them to speak about things that are very intimate in front of a crowd and the flashing lights  that s a high, high level of jiu jitsu  yeah, she s amazing  if you were to ask me what is impossible, my answer currently would be getting oprah on my three hour podcast, so we ll see  we ll see if that manifests something ''cal fussman  i wish i could say you got it  you got it  oprah owes me a solid ''cal fussman  oprah owes me one  don t worry about this  this may have a good amount of overlap with things we ve already talked about, but this is from devon hedgepess   best strategies to get to the heart while interviewing?''cal fussman  find out what they love  i mean, it s that simple  especially if you re able to do the research before, just hone in on something they re passionate about and they love talking about and just ask them about it  they re going to be happy to talk about it ''it s very simple  it s the exact opposite of going in feeling like a journalist who is determined to get a question answered  i ve got to get this  you talked about  gotcha  but there s like a level underneath that that s not so much gotcha, it s a legitimate okay, we need to know this  if you go in trying to grab something from anyone, they re going to protect it  so just make people relax by finding out what they like and then have them talk about it  this is really good advice  it took me a long time to figure out that, for myself at least, and i m still very much a novice, but sometimes the best place to start is really far off of any topic they ve covered in interviews related to their profession ''i remember interviewing edward norton, and i d spent a good amount of time with edward  but the way he interacts in interviews could be very different than the way he interacts over coffee having normal conversation  so i wanted to make him feel as relaxed as possible, so we just talked about surfing for the first five to ten minutes of the interview ''cal fussman  i remember that  we were sitting out on the malibu pier overlooking the water  we could see the surf line up  and i was like, okay, let s talk about surfing ''cal fussman  that s just a clear example of doing something that s very natural and getting somebody to feel at one with you and the place  to me, making the person, the subject, feel safe and comfortable, that s where it all starts ''obviously there s research before and there s the preparation of questions  but if you can t make a person feel safe, forget it  although look, that s just me  jorge ramos is going in there  he is not making them feel safe and he makes it work for him  yeah, he s doing the jon snow charging into battle approach ''cal fussman  yeah  from where he comes from, that s what s necessary  oh, you need that  he can t go in warm and fuzzy  that won t work, i wouldn t think ''cal fussman  his audience is his audience because they know he s going in to fight for them  a big part of this is realizing who you are  where do you come from, how do you want to get your own message across? just the way you were speaking, you re helping to uplift people  i m trying, yeah ''cal fussman  so your style is based on that  i don t know that i ever looked at an interview as a way of uplifting somebody but it s a very interesting way for me to look at it  because interestingly, i don t do it in interviews but when i give speeches or workshops, that s what i do  i m uplifting people  that s the intention ''cal fussman  yeah  we ve been talking about this over the last couple of days and you just lit the light bulb in my head  because i ve been saying to myself, what s going on? i m kind of moving into a place where i m like a player coach, now ''that s not who i was, but i m finding that i really enjoy this in a way that i didn t get out of writing a story in a magazine  i just understood why in this conversation  because it allows me to do what you do in an interview  it allows me to help uplift people  so if people are working in a company and the company is not hiring the right people because they re not interviewing them in the right way, i can give them information that is going to help them hire better and have a better company, and that makes me feel great  at the end of it, they re saying thank you and hugging me ''generally at the end of an interview, i hug people sometimes at the end of interviews, and people say thanks  but it s a different kind of thanks ''when somebody walks out of an interview and says thanks, it s hey, that was a really good time  when somebody walks out of a workshop and says thank you, it s a very different thing  there was this one woman   man, this is just hitting me as we re talking   who, at the end of this workshop, says,  you know, i spend more time on my job than i do at home  i hire the people that are around me on my job  i didn t know any of this about interviewing until you told us, and this is going to affect all the people i put around me going forward  thank you   that was an experience that i d never had before  so this is why   i m just understanding this now  why i m compelled to go in this other direction  well, i m excited to see the new direction  we also have some barbecue to eat in the not too distant future  so i think this has been great fun  we have so much more we could talk about  how to approach second time interviews, we were going to talk about george clooney  maybe that ll be in part three  there s so much that we could cover and so many great stories  but where can people find you online and where can they say hi?''cal fussman  you ve got calfussman com, and i just got kevin the manager to make sure that when you send an email in, he ll get it to me  kevin the manager ''cal fussman  kevin the manager  he ll get it to me and we ll get back to you  and then on twitter, is it  fussman  yeah  i ve got to do a better job on twitter  let s see if i can get jocko willink to sit you down and give you a tutorial  he s got plenty to do, but he s doing a great job on twitter ''cal fussman  i d love to meet jocko  that was a great talk  he s incredible  he s an incredible human being  tough young man, that jocko  well, cal, this is always so much fun  thank you for taking the time and i think i need to feed you more yerba mate, man  that was a hell of a tear  that was good ''cal fussman  you know what people don t realize is we don t know if the last installment was affected by the last tea  this caramel tea that i didn t realize puts you away  we ve been having tea and last night i was like,  cal, you want some tea?  he was like, sure  there was a big collection of tea and so after we did the evening, the p m  session interview yesterday, cal s like,  i really like this tea  ''he pointed to the caramel bedtime tea which literally, in the past when i ve taken it, has made me feel like leonardo dicaprio at the payphone in wolf of wall street ''cal fussman  i remember that, yeah, yeah  i was like, holy god, i can t believe you re even standing right now  i was very impressed you powered through that  so we ll focus on the south american stimulants, meaning yerba mate in the future, perhaps  but guys listening, we will have links to everything we can track down in the show notes  of course, cal s site and social and so on  please say hi to him  anything else to add before we sign off?''cal fussman  the whole weekend has been an absolute delight  i come out of here almost a changed man  it sounds odd ''we ve had about 36 hours of conversation and that part of you, that uplifting part of you, has taken me to places i m just starting, light bulbs are just starting to go off in my mind  so i can t wait to come back for the third, because i don t know where you re going to take me  it s just a joy to hang out with you, man  if i can, in my own meandering way, offer a few things from the path that i ve already traveled, then that makes my whole weekend  i always learn so much from you so i feel like very selfishly i m learning a lot more than i m giving out ''cal fussman  i don t know about that  but i am fixing your shoulder with the sauna  we have this barrel sauna which came from specks, developed by laird hamilton and then i think either duplicated or refined by rick ruben when we actually recorded the interview in there and burned our hands on the mics ''but so many adventures to have and we re just getting started  so everybody listening, you can find the show notes at fourhourworkweek com podcast as always, for this episode and every other  until next time, thank you for listening '"

afternoon shows, remotes, 60,000 is about right  i had a full career of this ''cal fussman  so, this is my first time behind the mic  thank you, tim ferriss, for giving me the opportunity to guest host the podcast ''larry king  oh, this is not your podcast ''cal fussman  well, it s my podcast, but tim is being kind enough to set it off into the atmosphere ''larry king  so, this is kind of a ferriss wheel ''cal fussman  oh, man  lar ''larry king  i love that  he wheeled it over to fussman  okay, i get it ''cal fussman  okay  this is my first  let s immediately talk about your first time behind the mic ''larry king  there s a little back story  i was in love with radio  as a kid, even i remember 5 or 6 years old, i would listen to the radio, imitate radio announcers  there would be shows like a tale well calculated to keep you in suspense  and i would, at 5 years old, run into the bathroom and, a tale well calculated, the shadow knows  and i was fascinated  my father died when i was 9 5  and that threw a roadblock into a lot of things  i couldn t go to college  i had to help support my mother  but, when i was a teenager, i d go into manhattan, we called it the city  we lived in brooklyn, and we called manhattan they said going to the city ''i would visit radio shows that had studio audiences  and i would watch announcers read off scripts and drop the paper down, look at microphones ''and i said i want to do that  i really want to do that  i had a bunch of odd jobs after high school, one of which was for the associated merchandizing corporation whose offices were at 1440 broadway on the third floor  on the 20th floor was wor radio  later, when i had a nationally syndicated show, wor was my new york affiliate  but i would take the elevator up to the 20th floor, and there were elevator operators then  and i would say to the elevator operator,  lobby please,  pretending i was an announcer  i fantasized i was an announcer  i worked for united parcel service  i worked for hearn s department store  and then, i  ''cal fussman  so, you knew this was your destiny?''larry king  yeah  well, i knew it was my destiny  i didn t know where i would start  i m 22 years old  my mother is now working  i had to help support her  my brother is in college ''and i m walking down the street, and a friend, i don t know who it was even, introduced me to a guy named james seramos who was director of announcers at cbs  and i said to him,  i would love to be a radio announcer  what advice do you give me?  and he said,  well, are you single?  i said,  yeah   he said,  try miami  it s a big market, a lot of stations, no union  and they might have older people on the way out and younger people on the way up  and it might be a shot   so, my uncle, my mother s sister had passed away, and my uncle who owned a tuxedo store in new york had retired down to miami beach ''he had an apartment  and he said i could stay with him because i had no money  and i took a train down to miami  and i think i had  11 00 or  12 00 in my pocket ''and i went to stay with him  i arrived at the train station  the first thing i saw was a water fountain that said  colored  and  white , two water fountains  i drank out of the colored fountain  i had never seen a thing like that growing up in new york  couldn t believe it  i get on a bus to go over to miami beach  i m sitting in the back  the bus driver pulls over and asks me to please move up to the front  the back is for negroes, and the front is for whites  first day in miami  so, i said,  my father is negro  i prefer to sit in the back   i mean, it just annoyed me so much  anyway, i went over, and i went around the radio stations ''and they wouldn t listen to me  i was 22 years old ''cal fussman  so, you re just knocking on doors?''larry king  yeah  no experience  do you have any jobs open? i went to wiod was one of the first stations i went to where i later worked for 19 years  so, i went to this small station on miami beach, wahr, went in, very small station  general manager was marshal simmons, a nice guy ''and he said,  i ll give you a voice test   and he put me into a little studio with a microphone like this  and he gave me a news analysis to read  and that s the first time i ever   and i read it  and he said,  well, you have a nice voice  and we have a lot of change over here  we re very small  we don t pay a lot  if you want to hang around and watch the announcers work and watch how they get the news, if an opening happens, we ll give you a shot   so, i hung around for maybe three or four weeks  i stayed there day and night  i watched the announcers  i watched them rip and read ''i would go out with sunny hirsch when he did sports interviews  i just was taking it all in  and one day, a friday, marshal simmons, the general manager, called me, and he says,  well, tom bayer is leaving  ''tom bayer was an unusual situation  he made  55 00 a week, and his alimony was  60 00 a week  he figured out once that he could not make it on this  he used to live off coconuts, coconuts from trees  so, he says,  you start monday morning  you re on from 9 00 to 12 00 in the morning, and in the afternoon, you ll do news and sports  ''cal fussman  so, you got your whole weekend to prepare for this now ''larry king  i went crazy  the whole weekend i had  i went back home  i came back to the radio station saturday morning, started picking out the music i m going to play, hung around there all saturday  sunday practiced, went into the little studio, good morning, good morning  this record, les elgart, swinging down the lane  i m so excited  now, it s monday morning, may 1, 1957  i get there like 6 00  i go on at 9 00  my uncle hugs me and wishes me the best  it was a warm, muggy, sunny, miami beach morning, 840 first street right opposite the police station ''i would visit there last year, by the way  it s another station now  but, anyway, i walk in  there s a secretary that comes in at about 8 00  i say hello to the all night guy, stack up my records, i m ready to play  and then, marshal simmons says,  come into my office,  at like 8 45  and i go in  and he goes,  well, this is your first day on the air  the best of luck to you   and i said,  thank you   and he said,  what name are you going to use?  i said,  what are you talking about?  and he goes,  well, larry zeiger,  that was my name,  ain t going to work   now, it would work ''now, any name would go  engelbert humperdinck, any name would go  so, he says,  zeiger won t work  it s a little too ethnic, and people won t know how to spell it  and we got to change your name  ''and i said,  i m going on the air in 12 minutes   and he said,  yeah,  and he had the miami herald open, and i would later write a column for them  all of these things are like miracles  and there was an ad for king s wholesale liquors on washington avenue ''cal fussman  so, he looks down at that ad  ''larry king  he looked, and he said,  how about larry king?  and i said,  okay, sounds good   a year later, we legally changed, and it s legally changed in aftra  so, if you re a broadcaster today at an aftra station, even if your name is larry king, you can t use larry king because it s a branded name  yeah, it s true  and then, it becomes where you become famous, no one can ever use it  no one could be arthur godfrey or jackie gleason, even if your name is jackie gleason  if you get a television show, you can t be jackie gleason on an aftra station  anyway, so, now, i got a new name  now, i go in  i m about to go on the air ''at 9 00, i start the record  humming and singing   i lower the record, put on the microphone, and nothing comes out ''cal fussman  nothing comes out of your mouth?''larry king  nothing  i bring the record back up, lower it down, bring it back up, lower it down, and i am panicked  i am sweating  i m looking at the clock  and i literally said to myself i can t do it  i can do a lot of things, but i m nervous, and my whole career is done  and marshal simmons, god rest him, kicked open the door to the control room and said,  this is a communications business, damn it, communication   he closed the door  i turned down the record, put the mic on and said,  good morning  my name is larry king  and that s the first time i ve ever said that because i ve just been given this name  '' and let me tell you, this is my first day ever on the air  and all of my life, i dreamed of this  when i was 5 years old, i would imitate announcers   the story i just told you, i told the radio audience that day  my father died, i had to   and i m nervous  i was very nervous here  so, please bear with me  i played the record and was never nervous again  and later in life, that story, i would tell it to arthur godfrey, jackie gleason, and others  and they said,  well, you learned the secret of this business, which is there s no secret  be yourself  ''so, what i did that day, i wasn t brilliant, i wasn t conceiving this, carried through me for 60 years, which is be yourself  don t be afraid to ask a question  don t be afraid to sound stupid ''cal fussman  what did that teach you about honesty?''larry king  and not just honesty  yeah, it teaches you a lot about being open and honest on the air  but, of course, what you do when you do that is you bring the audience into your circumstance  and when you do that, if they like you, you win them  if they don t like you, they re not going to like you anyway  you can t make them like you  i asked edward bennett williams, the great criminal defense lawyer, once what s the no  1 role of a criminal defense lawyer  and he said,  put one juror in my client s shoes  ''cal fussman  how would that play out?''larry king  if you can put one client in your client s shoes, he ll never vote guilty because he would say i would have done that  all right  so, what i did that day was put the audience in my shoes  and i recommend that  i ve done a book, how to talk to anyone, anytime, anywhere  i do a course  if you re going to be   your first public speech ''you re scared  get up and tell them you re scared  they would understand because they d be scared, too  bring them into your situation  i was on the air when we had the earthquake here  i was on television, cnn, there were cameras bouncing around  i m broadcasting the earthquake  we re having an earthquake  desks are flying  i m over there,  i hope we re still on  if we re still on,  you know what i mean? i was in the station alone during a hurricane  and i broadcasted the hurricane  for example, we were out of money  it was a cigarette machine and a candy machine  it was just me and the engineer in the station alone  no one could get there  i broke the machine on the air ''cal fussman  they heard you breaking into the machine?''larry king  yeah  of course, i told them my situation  i got no cigarettes, and i got no food  i said,  you want to hear what a hurricane sounds like?  we were the only station in the city, wiod, with a generator ''an emergency generator, we were the only thing on the air  you had to tune to us  so, i would go outside, lean the microphone out the window, and say,  here s what it sounds like   and i broadcast the hurricane  i just ate it up, yeah ''cal fussman  this is the power of storytelling what you re talking about ''larry king  yeah  well, the power is i was always good at that  when i was a kid, they called me zeke like short for larry zeiger  i was zeke the creek the mouthpiece because i would, as herby said, i would go to a two hour baseball game and come back and tell the guys about it and take two hours  in other words, i was descriptive  i always had the ability  i thought i would be a baseball announcer  that was my goal to be a sports announcer because i knew i could describe things well in front of me ''cal fussman  do you think that s a learned skill? or is that something that you just had inside of you?''larry king  i have no idea  i think you can teach certain things  you can t teach a good voice  i never had a voice lesson  i had laryngitis maybe once in the 60 years  i ve worked sick  when i had a heart attack, i was only off the air 10 days  i think one of the reasons for my longevity is the love of what i do  in other words, i may have an unhappy day at home  things may not go right  i can t control   but when that light goes on, i control my environment  and then, how many people get to control their environment? so, when i hosted a radio show every night or television show every day or wrote a column, i controlled the question i would ask  i controlled my environment ''cal fussman  it s interesting you say that because when i was thinking of doing the podcast, one of the things that scared me was, as a writer all of those years, i had control of the content ''and i can do an interview, but, afterwards, i could piece it together to create the story in the best way possible  when you re doing an interview, certainly, that s live, you don t have that ''larry king  correct ''cal fussman  and so, i was going to have to give that up in order to do this ''larry king  you ve got to trust yourself  if you trust yourself, if you say to yourself   i have never said to myself,  can i ask this?  i asked it  i never doubted myself  i don t have it in social circumstances  i don t have it in life  i don t have command of situations  but i trusted myself because i loved it ''if you love communicating   a lot of writers aren t good broadcasters ''cal fussman  a lot of them are terrible broadcasters ''larry king  yeah  because they re used to the comfort of the control on the typewriter, and they write it  if they only said to themselves, you know, i control this, too, i control it, you do control it  you re controlling this podcast right now  not me, you ''cal fussman  you know, the interesting thing, and maybe we can set this story up together because it reminded me of a story that al pacino tells that goes back to the godfather  and i know you re good friends with him, and you ve heard about his arc through that beginning where, in the very beginning  ''larry king  they were going to throw him off ''cal fussman  yeah  do you want to tell a little about that, and then, i ll take it up to a point where he knew that the godfather was going to be great  and it speaks to this, what we re talking about ''larry king  i m trying to remember  i got so many memories ''cal fussman  all right  so, al started, and he wasn t i think the top draft choice of the studio brass ''larry king  they wanted robert redford ''cal fussman  they went along with it  and then, in the beginning, he was having a hard time grasping the part  and then, i believe it was, at a point where they were thinking of getting rid of him, and he did that famous scene where he goes into the bathroom to get the gun  ''larry king  get the gun to kill the cop ''cal fussman  that s right ''larry king  and he throws the gun away, which was his idea, and he had the confidence  and they kept him ''cal fussman  that s exactly it  and so, later on, the movie is proceeding, and they re doing the scene where the godfather is going to be buried  and everybody works through the scene all day  at 6 00, everybody is going home ''they re all walking away  and al is about to leave  and he looks over, and he sees francis ford coppola sitting on a grave stone weeping  and he walks over  and francis is balling, and he says,  francis, francis, what s wrong? are you okay?  and coppola says to him,  they wouldn t give me another set up, meaning the brass wasn t going to pay for him to be able to shoot it again   and al knew this guy is going to make a movie here because, if you care that much, and you have that kind of passion  ''larry king  see, now, i didn t know that story  so, you are telling me that story  i knew the story of they were going to throw him off until he finished that scene  i know brando, i talked to brando a lot about it  i know one of the great scenes in the godfather was totally adlibbed by brando  and that s the scene right before he dies ''he s sitting with michael, his son, al, and he s an old man now  and the grandson is playing  that s where he dies  he falls over playing with the grandson  he s sitting, and the waiter comes by, and the scene was,  do you want anything else,  and they say,  no,  they both say no, and he dismisses the waiter  and they keep talking  the waiter comes by for the scene  and the waiter says,  do you want anything else?  and brando, out of nowhere says,  i ll have some wine   and he looks at al pacino, and he says,  lately, i drink a lot of wine  ''cal fussman  oh, man ''larry king  but it so fit  he s old now  he s not the mafia don he once was   lately, i drink a lot of wine  ''cal fussman  and the passion that that must come from, whether you re al seeing coppola on the grave stone or whether you are in that moment and these words just come out of you, it just seems central to what makes people great ''larry king  well, you hit a great word, moment  and what i ve tried to do the whole career is be in the moment  so, i m always in the moment  that is, if i ve interviewed al pacino yesterday and barack obama tomorrow, but i m interviewing you today, i m totally into you today  i m not thinking about yesterday  and once the show is over, i never think about it  i don t listen to it  i know what i did  i don t have to listen to it ''i don t have to watch it ''cal fussman  wow  that s what i need ''larry king  you won t have to listen to this podcast  you ll remember it  you know what you did  what are you going to listen for, unless you want to judge it? i don t  i never have, in my life, listened to myself  once i ve done it because i know i ve been in the moment, i trust   see, the word is trust  i don t trust myself off the air  and that s weird  i made so many mistakes, been in debt, many marriages  life didn t always work out for me  i tried to be a good father, sometimes was, sometimes wasn t  but on the air, no one ever called me in in my whole career to say what did you say yesterday ''cal fussman  well, there was one great story from the first station in miami  you got to tell this  it s my favorite larry king story ''larry king  it s a great story  it s a true story  but management never really reamed me out ''but what happened was i had just started in radio  i was on the air two months  i m working 9 00 to 12 00  i m on in the afternoons, and i m loving every second of it  i can t wait to get there  i can t wait to be on  god, i loved it  and the general manager, marshal simmons, called me in and said,  al fox, the all night guy, is sick tonight  would you do the all night show?  and i said,  sure   he said,  well, you ll be here alone   very small station   we don t have an engineer at night  you just record the meter readings, play music and talk, and you re on from midnight to 6 00  and then, you ll hang around, and you ll be on again at 9 00 and then, get some rest  '' oh, sure   now, i m alone in the station  i m playing records, and i m talking to people  we talk about the time and the weather and what s going on in the world because i m living every minute of this ''and the phone rings, and i pick it up, and i say,  wahr   and this woman, i could tell you the truth, cal, i can almost hear it now  this sexy woman voice says,  i want you   remember, i m 22 years old  i think the pimples on my face are from hershey bars  i am a jew in heat  and this girl   no one has ever said to me i want you  and i suddenly said to myself, there are more than two benefits to being in this business  so, i said,  what do you want?  she says,  come over  come over my house   i said,  i m on the air  i get off at 6 00  i ll be over at 6 00   she says,  i only live 10 blocks away  and i have to go to work at 6 00  so, it s now or never  '' here s my address  try to come over   i got this moral dilemma now  my career, my radio, or no one has ever said i want you  so, here s what the radio audience heard   ladies and gentlemen, i m just filling in tonight  so, i m going to give you a particularly good time here  i m going to play the entire harry belafonte at carnegie hall album uninterrupted   i had 23 minutes, which is all the time i needed, and which is still true to this day  anyway, i put the record on  we didn t have tapes then  it was an actual record  zoom out to the car, drive out to her house, there s the car she described it in the driveway  i pulled into the house, the light is on  over to the door, i go in ''there s a little, dark room, and there s this woman in a white negligee sitting on the couch  she opens her arms  i grab her  i pulled her around  my cheek is against her cheek  and she s got the radio on  and i m hearing harry belafonte and he says   he s singing jamaica farewell  and he sings,  down the way where the nights, where the nights, where the nights, where the nights,  the record gets stuck  i place the girl back at the end of the couch, run out to my car  jewish masochism  i keep the radio on all the way driving to the station  where the nights, where the nights, where the nights, where the nights ''i get in, all of the lights are going flashing from people calling in  i m totally embarrassed  i m picking up, i m apologizing to people  and the last caller was an older jewish man  and i just said,  wahr, good morning   and all i hear was,  where the nights, where the nights, where the nights  i m going crazy with where the nights  ''i said,  gee, i m sorry  why didn t you just change the station?  and he said,  i m an invalid, and i m in bed  and a nurse takes care me  she leaves at night  she sets it to your station  the radio is up on the bureau  i can t reach it  i m stuck   and i said,  gee, can i do anything for you?  he says,  yeah, play  inaudible    but i didn t get fired for that  another thing that i almost got fired, and i don t know if you even know this story, cal  i had to make a living, so, i was making like  60 00 a week from the radio station  and i was doing   when i first started on television, i was making  100 00 from that ''and i was also the announcer at the dog track  there goes rusty, miami beach dog track  it was right near joe s stone crabs  i used to walk in, look into joe s stone crabs window, and say,  i wonder if i can ever eat there  ''anyway, i was doing three jobs  and this was new year s eve  so, i taped the television show, did my radio show, and did the dog track  now, the next morning, i m on  i think it was on that shift, i was on 8 00 to 12 00 or 8 00 to 11 00, whatever it was  so, i m dead tired  and it s new year s morning  no one at the station  and it s a news station, wkat  and there s big window doors leading in where you could look up and see the announcer in the station  and i m so tired  and i m just playing music and talking  and oh, my god, please  and 9 00, don mcneil and the breakfast club goes on  that s a show from chicago ''it s an hour every day, syndicated  good morning, breakfast lovers and howdy do ya  at the 9 30 point in that show, don mcneil would say we ll be back in 30 seconds ''this is the abc radio network  and all i had to do was turn off that mic, turn on my mic and say this is wkat, the big cat in miami beach, and switch that switch back on and go back to chicago and turn mine off  well, what i did was, he said,  this is the abc radio network   and i turned him off, turned my mic on, and fell asleep ''cal fussman  oh, man ''larry king  no, i m the only one in the station, and i m snoring like this  anyway, all people at home hear is  snoring   so, they panic  somebody called the miami beach police department, and the fire department comes  they look in the window, and they see a guy slumped against the microphone  and they figure i m dead ''so, they take hatchets and break their way in through the window  and as they break all of the hatchets in, i wake up  and now, you re listening on the radio, and the firemen are going,  are you okay, sir    what the hell is going on   all of this is on the air  and i look up, and it s like 9 45  and i say,  now, back to the breakfast club with don mcneil   and the general manager of the station, frank catzentine, called me in ''cal fussman  did you think you were going to get fired?''larry king  think? all he said was,  i know you re glib, and i know you re good  we like your work  but give me any reason why i shouldn t fire you  any reason, if it s within reason, i ll accept it because i like you, but i got to fire you  by all rules of radio and ethics, i got to fire you  ''i said to him,  okay  here s what i was doing  i was attempting to check the reaction of the miami beach fire and rescue department  how quickly can they come to an emergency? they got there pretty fast  we could have a good report on this  i ll do a little special   and he said,  you son of a bitch  get out of here   but i had to pay for the window  he took out  10 00 a week out of my salary until the window was paid for  but those occurrences, with the lady, nothing ever happened because management was asleep  i never got in trouble for something i said  i never cursed on the air  i never said something that would bring me into repute  i just was   i loved the radio  and then, now, i m on the internet ''and people curse on the internet  i ve had guests say the f word  i still can t  i can t bring myself to do it because i m so cognizant of the microphone and the old rules ''cal fussman  well, first thing, are we hearing biscuit the dog snoring?''larry king  that s fine ''cal fussman  i m just taking larry s advice here and just describing what s going on ''larry king  biscuit snores  you can take him and put him in another room  he don t care  he s 8 years old now  he s just an old dog  that adds to the   see, here s the beauty of the podcast ''cal fussman  that s right  now, they know biscuit ''larry king  right  in the old days, you would have been signaling the guy to try to get him to take the   cut that, cut that, watch that, don t do that, don t   what the hell?''biscuit was snoring, if you heard the sound  if you didn t hear it, okay, that s what he cut for  if you did hear it, it s cute ''cal fussman  and tim has got a dog, molly, who he often has on his podcast and is always a great audience  one of the things about tim s audience is they want to know how to be better in all aspects of life  what would you say   let s talk a little about curiosity, about speaking, listening, empathy  you are one of the most curious people i ve ever met  is that something that is engrained? or is it something that everybody has but somehow, you never lost?''larry king  good question, cal  that s why the fussman factor podcast will be a success  truthfully, i don t know ''i was always curious  i remember, as an 8 year old or 9 year old, i d get on the bus and ask the bus driver why do you want to drive a bus  my curiosity was endless  so, it lent me into a broadcast booth that worked for me  that worked for me  my curiosity worked for me  i never got good grades in school, except in things with oral projects like english where i could ask questions of the teacher  so, i always had that curiosity and managed to find a work place that brought it to me  i don t know the answer to that, but i could give you rules ''cal fussman  sure, what are rules?''larry king  listen  listening is as important as what you re asking  so, don t worry about your next question  now, that s risk taking, but don t worry about your next question ''cal fussman  often, you see, when people are in conversation, you can almost look at somebody carefully and see they re thinking about what they re going to say next ''larry king  now, that is natural  i react  you can t tell someone just starting  so, someone just starting, if it s comfortable for you to make little notes to yourself so you have a bridge to fall back on, do it  you want to be good  but, eventually, get to be where you don t need those notes  your curiosity works for you  and sometimes, the simplest question is the best  like when we had the first   the war in kuwait when we went into iraq, we didn t go to baghdad ''cal fussman  oh, desert storm, right ''larry king  we would have generals on every night and reporters  and i would hear people out of other stations,  this happened today and this happened   my first question was what happened today ''okay  now, i m getting their perspective of what happened today  now, based on their answer, i ll have to have another question, and i would  whatever the answer was, even if it was today, the troops advanced 10 miles into the enemy territory  that s the answer ''cal fussman  okay ''larry king  did that surprise you?''cal fussman  there you go ''larry king  here we go, go right with it  why did they do that? do you trust the information that your superiors give you? there s so many things like i watch interviews today, they re nuts  people are terrible, especially after sporting events ''cal fussman  what s the worst thing you ve seen?''larry king  i see it every day  we have just seen a sporting event  a guy just got his first major league homerun to win the game ''one stupid question i saw was this was your first major league game  it was the ninth inning  the count was 2 and 1, and you hit that homerun to right field  and they put the mic in front of them  what s the question? there s no question  or the second dumbest question  you got a home run and you re first at bat  what does it feel like? he s going to answer, terrible  i didn t to hit a homerun  i wanted to strike out  i would go other areas like when you played little league, what were some of your baseball dreams  and he might say to play in my first game  did you ever visualize hitting a homerun? what were you thinking when you were on deck? were your parents here?''cal fussman  and not only are these unexpected questions, but they re easily answered  yes, my parents were here or no, they weren t ''larry king  and then, feeling with them, talk to them  in other words, put yourself   it s a lot of how would you be in that situation, except you don t have to refer to yourself  you don t have to say i would have done  i don t use the word i  i ask questions because i m an observer  i m present at the creation  i like to be there  again it s the moment  i like to be in the moment ''cal fussman  can what you do be used by anybody in their office?''larry king  i would guess so  i do a course based on the book how to talk to anyone anytime, anywhere  i ve had some successful people tell me that the book helped them in their life ''it s still in print  i saw it in norway  yes, you can because, in a communicating world, now, the big difference today is, with modern technology, it s probably easier today to text  so, people text today, which is sad to me  so, you don t need the art of phrasing  you don t need to use your voice well ''cal fussman  do we lose something? you see people with their cell phones in their hands looking down ''larry king  terrible ''cal fussman  what do we lose when we no longer have eye contact with people?''larry king  intimacy  that s what i want in every show i do, an intimate relationship with the guest  if i can establish that like sinatra, i ve got a letter here sinatra wrote to me after his last television interview  you make the camera disappear ''intimacy, trust  if the guest will trust you, you re home because they know you re sincerely interested in them  and, therefore, you could go anywhere  you can go anywhere  it depends how you phrase the question, how you feel  but if you could put yourself in their shoes and get their emotion, it s a good tip  nobody thinks they re bad  nobody  hitler didn t comb his hair in the morning and say,  i am an evil person  i am doing good for my country   so, if you re going to interview hitler, the stupidest first question would be why did you invade poland ''the best kind of first question is, if i were interviewing osama bin laden, the stupidest first question would be why did you kill 3,000 people on that september day in new york?''i would have asked him,  you grew up in the richest family in saudi arabia  why did you leave?  now, that gets him to think  but what he didn t think about why he left that day  but now  ''cal fussman  you ve made him curious about himself ''larry king  right  but he also knows i m sincerely curious about him  i have made no judgment in that question  i don t bring an agenda  what do we want? we want to learn  all we want is information  we why to know the whys of osama bin laden  wouldn t that help you understand, when you re dealing with the osama bin laden of the future, why do you want to know? all we want is   i remember once, i had this great guy on, swami satchidananda ''i never forgot him, from india  and he was so calm about everything  and he was the kind of guy, i remember he said,  when you wake up in the morning, when you open your eyes, did you deserve that day? whether you believe in god or whatever, did larry   did the swami deserve this day?  you woke up, it s a gift  you don t know where it came from  it s a gift, the gift of life  you woke up  so, what if it s raining? you ve got the gift of the day  so, what if the toast is burnt? make more toast  you ve got the gift  i said to him,  swami, what if i told you i ll pick you up tomorrow at 3 00, take you to the airport, and i don t show? what would you do? '' i would call you and say, larry, how are you? i know something terrible must have happened because you weren t there  the shoe is on your foot   then, i asked him the world s greatest question   okay, swami,  i was being cute,  you come home, walk up into your bedroom, and your wife is in bed with another guy   and he said to me,  what would you do?  and i said,  i would scream and yell, and that s what everyone would do  scream and yell  the guy would run out, and the woman would be screaming, and pandemonium   but what do you want in that situation?''cal fussman  information ''larry king  information  how is the best way to get it?  okay, this is very embarrassing, you two  i m going to go down and make some tea  why don t the both of you come down to breakfast then  let s talk about this  ''who owns that moment?''cal fussman  you re in control ''larry king  yeah  that s the hardest thing to do  but, basically, that s what i would do on the air  why are you doing this? why are you doing that? my curiosity would be there no matter what the situation  and, eventually, i would be asking osama bin laden why did he send those people out that day in september ''cal fussman  the more you re talking, the more i m seeing the power of control in questions ''larry king  it s all control  for most of my life in this great business, i have controlled my environment when working  and, for a lot of time, when i did my national radio show, i did the first national network show, i was on from midnight to 5 00  i was on cnn from 9 00 to 10 00  i wrote a weekly column in usa today ''when i was writing the column, when i was on the radio for five hours, and when i was on television for the hour, i control all of that ''cal fussman  so, people could, actually, use what you were doing to gain a better control over their own lives, even if it s not in broadcasting, just the use of the questions, like the swami said ''larry king  unfortunately, i don t do as well in the personal life  everyone has their   a lot of comedians are very unhappy people ''cal fussman  right ''larry king  and they see things funny for an escape from their own reality  so, i do very well in this circumstance sitting here talking to you  but i couldn t hang a picture well  i d hit my thumb ''i m not a   i try to be a good driver  i m not a great driver  in other words, no one is perfect  but in areas where you can, especially in the work environment, where you can control something, yeah, i could teach you how to do it ''cal fussman  what about empathy? because that seems to be a quality that you have  you can listen to anybody, and you re making them feel  ''larry king  i m not judgmental ''cal fussman  right ''larry king  that i learned from broadcasting  what am i going to judge? i m there to learn  let the audience   see, the audience makes up its own mind  i m a conduit from me to you  i learn, and through me, you learn  but i don t make a judgment call  in other words, i m not the kind of broadcaster who argues with the guest  it s just not my style  i am passionate politically, off the air ''but i felt at best as a broadcaster that my role as a journalist was to give you   at the end of an hour, and you knew more the hour before  when there s arguing, you don t learn  i don t like broadcasts where the guy just stands on a soapbox and talks for an hour ''cal fussman  well, there doesn t seem to be any empathy on tv anymore ''larry king  that s gone  the day of the long form interview is kind of gone  it s sad ''cal fussman  actually, it seems like the podcast is one way of trying to  ''larry king  that s the last venue of the long form interview  this could not occur on television today  what you re doing right now could not occur  for a radio station, it would be rare because, today, people want eat it up, speed it up, get it out  it s a spit it out business  get it up, get it out ''can t get enough, get right through it  today, the rules are you do an interview show today, the guest should be on tops 10 minutes  you don t want a half hour interview today  they re going to tune out because they ve got 500 channels  and you can t   and i think technology has added  ''cal fussman  what are we losing?''larry king  knowledge ''cal fussman  so, we re not getting the information  and when you look at everything that s going on politically, it seems like we re not getting any depth anymore ''larry king  that s why this new york times that i have right here is my bible  i learn more from it every day than i get from all of cable television  and they ve got cameras  new york times doesn t  but they can write an in depth article that continues on page 46  and i get more out of it  the sad thing is that newspapers are going away ''that s all part of   technology brings improvements, and they bring bad things, too  when i spoke in norway a couple of weeks ago, and someone was asking me about technology, here s the best and the worst thing about it  we know that somewhere in the world today, a guy is working on a cure for cancer, this brilliant scientist  another guy is writing a great play  and another guy is inventing a new kind of airplane that will exceed the speed of sound  and another guy is planning how to build a nuclear weapon that you can hide in your hands and get on a plane  he s doing that, too ''so, the guy who is curing cancer, he s going to succeed  but the guy with the bomb is going to succeed, too  so, this is what you face as we advance as a culture  we advance  remember, the small grocer got overtaken  i liked the small grocer  i liked the guy who took the little pencil who added up on the paper bag and took the clipper and got the toilet paper down from the top of the rack  that s gone ''cal fussman  the interesting thing to me though is that it seems like questions are becoming more important now because, in this age of technology, you can google any answer  a 6 year old can google any answer to any question in 4 seconds  but the right question, no  that 6 year old might not be able to come up with it ''larry king  ask more ''go through a day, and see how many people ask questions rather than say things  my motto, my broadcast motto all of my life was i never learned anything when i was talking ''cal fussman  and that s interesting because you see tv and the idea is just to talk over somebody to get your point  ''larry king  now, at times, you have to  for example, if i m speaking, if you speak, as you do, and i m making a comment in front of a group, of course  i m not learning anything  but i m entertaining  that s different  you can entertain  if i m telling a joke, i know the end of the joke  so, i m not learning anything, but i m providing entertainment  if i m making a speech, i m not learning anything, but i m providing knowledge  but if i m a questioner, i never learned anything when i was talking  if i m asking a question of you, it better be a question not a statement, not a history lesson  ask the question ''so many people, i want to yell sometimes is what s the question ''cal fussman  i hear what you re saying  is there advice that you would give young people to better ask questions? i ll sit down before an interview, and i ll write out maybe 200 questions i want to ask ''larry king  if that s what works for you  never do what doesn t work for you  so, if larry king says don t wrote out questions in advance that would be stupid for me to say  i don t do it  i can t tell you what to do  whatever is your comfort zone ''cal fussman  is there something about the foundation of i did these speeches, change your questions, change your life, to look at questions a different way, to look at the power in them  step aside from where you are ''look at yourself and see how a different question could change your position  is this something that you have done? or you re just constantly in the moment ''larry king  i never sat down and figured it out  i m just in the moment  i didn t do self analysis  i m in the moment  but i know that listening is as important as asking  listening is as important as what you ask because follow up is  you have to be in the moment ''cal fussman  is there advice? is there ways for people to improve their listening?''larry king  i guess  in this modern age of technology where you have instant information and where you can text people, listen is a weird word ''think about the word listen  what are you listening to today? you re reading stuff off your little iphone ''cal fussman  and often, people have their ears plugged to take in what they want to hear  so, they re pushing away the outside ''larry king  i ll tell you, often, how people don t listen  we can test it  i did this with jim bishop one day  in miami, he did a column on this  when you see someone that you know and pass on the street, how you doing? right? i say i ve got brain cancer  how is the wife? because they don t listen  how are you doing? they don t want to know how you re doing  don t stop  how am i doing? i ll tell you how i m doing  the bank called me today  the second mortgage payment  you want to know how i m doing? sit down, i ll tell you how i m doing ''cal fussman  is there a way to break through that sort of cocktail party banter that means nothing?''larry king  now, this i don t know the answer to  i have always had people respond to me  and it s worked with women ''cal fussman  so, you just get genuine, sincere responses ''larry king  yeah  and as george burns said,  if you can fake that, you got it made   but i have always known, in interview situations, i ve always known that i can get people to respond to me  so, i could use humor  i could use   but they know that i really want to know what they re thinking and why they did what they did  and people appreciate that  i don t know anybody that doesn t like to talk about what they did, except brando who didn t like to talk about acting ''cal fussman  but that can be useful to anybody in any situation, in the office  ''larry king  of course ''cal fussman  just by looking into somebody and being  ''larry king  being sincere and zeroing in ''cal fussman  right ''larry king  there s two questions you ask in the same quest  why did you do that? or why did you do that? you re going to get a better answer with the second ''cal fussman  right  i was doing some reading, and they say that, when you take in a question, 10 percent is only the words, 30 percent is the tone of voice, what you just illustrated ''larry king  tone is very important, which you don t get with your iphone ''cal fussman  and 60 percent is the body language behind that question ''larry king  which you don t get with your iphone ''cal fussman  yeah  and so, i guess this is something people can work on, if they want to, to learn how to better communicate ''larry king  yeah  well, we re trying all of the time  how to talk to anyone anytime, anywhere  how to be better   we all want to do better ''you re always learning  and you always accept the fact that you re still learning ''cal fussman  if you re in sales, you got to connect with people  if you re a leader of a company, you got to connect with people  and, basically, they can use the same skills that you re using ''larry king  or course  anyone can use them  presidents of countries can use them ''cal fussman  i got some questions from tim that he sent over ''larry king  okay  this is the ferriss wheel question ''cal fussman  this is the ferriss wheel question ''larry king  we ve been going a long time here, cal ''cal fussman  okay  it didn t feel that way to me ''larry king  well, we ve been over an hour  i don t want to break it to you, cal, but you re starting to get annoying  and i want to tell you, listeners  this is going to be a great podcast  but there does hit a point with the fussman factor where he gets annoying  and we re very close to that point now  yes, what questions does the ferriss wheel want?''cal fussman  this is from tim  if you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere, what would it say and why?''larry king  a gigantic billboard anywhere? let me think  good question, tim  slow down! or ban all guns ''cal fussman  there you go  i was thinking the john wooden line when you said slow down  he said,  be quick, but don t hurry   that s pretty good ''larry king  that s good ''cal fussman  what is the book, tim asks, you ve given most as a gift and why?''larry king  i guess, through life, it s catcher in the rye  i love that book  i read it at four different times in my life  teenager and later ''cal fussman  does it change?''larry king  yeah  you get different meanings from it  i get different reactions  for example, my son, chance, who is 18 hated holden caulfield, thought he was a pompous, spoiled brat ''i never saw him that way, didn t find him funny  it s interesting the way kids   that perspective  that s good writing  if you can react hostilely to it ''cal fussman  yeah  and 50 years from now, he may have a very different look at it ''larry king  right  for example, you read dickens, i like scrooge  he wasn t a bad guy, scrooge  look at it this way, cratchit was a big complainer  he s a whiner  come home, he s got a son, tiny tim  take care of him  stop with the crap  do your work  look at this dog ''cal fussman  biscuit  can you name one to three books that have massively impacted your life?''larry king  well, catcher in the rye would be one  a quiet hero, the life of lou gehrig, and then, most of the books i m currently reaching  richard nixon s biography, it s terrific, by john farrell ''i m into the moment of what i m doing now ''cal fussman  you read like six books at once  i ve been with you on airplanes ''larry king  what i try to do is a novel and nonfiction  and i can read those two at once  but i got three going now ''cal fussman  what s the third?''larry king  i got the richard nixon book, and i got alec baldwin s memoir  ''cal fussman  oh, you were reading the franken  ''larry king  i finished al franken s book  fantastic  funny, on the mark, funny  and then, i m reading shattered, the campaign of hillary clinton ''cal fussman  pretty good title  in the last five years, what new belief or behavior has most improved your life? do you have new beliefs in the last five years?''larry king  no, but the more i exist, the less i believe in something out there  i don t believe in god ''i don t believe in life after death  most people get older, and they find some belief  i get older and find less  i have no   this is it ''cal fussman  you re just in the moment ''larry king  the thing i fear the most is death because i can t imagine not existing  that drives me bonkers ''cal fussman  we were talking about this at breakfast that we re all energy ''larry king  yeah  i don t know what you mean by that, we re all energy ''cal fussman  that s what we are  we re energy  and so, you re still going to be floating around somehow ''larry king  come on  i m floating around  do i know where i am?''cal fussman  well, you re not going to know it  well, i can t make any guarantees on that  but i have a feeling that you never go away  and, certainly, you will be around for all of us to remember you  what about memories?''larry king  yeah  memory, you ll have tapes of me  i can exist  but i m not there, you understand, fussman? i don t exist ''cal fussman  i get it ''larry king  and that bugs me to not exist  for example, who is going to be the next president? who is going to win the pennant? the why person fears death ''cal fussman  because they re not going to know the answers ''larry king  it s the one thing   i married into a family, they all believe  they re mormons  they believe i m going somewhere else  and i say to them you can t lose  you re in a win win  if you die and you go somewhere else, you were right  if you don t, you don t know it  they can t lose ''cal fussman  that s good strategy ''larry king  it don t work for me because i can t accept the fact  there s no heaven  there s no other plain  i m not going to some planet ''cal fussman  stay here  what purchase of  100 00 or less has most positively impacted your life in the last 6 months or recent memory?''larry king  where did he come up with that question? a  100 00 or less?''cal fussman  i don t know  tim, where did you come up with that question?''larry king  that s a ferriss wheel  that s the kind of thing, if you re stuck on a ferriss wheel, you think of stuff like that  ferriss, if i m stuck at the top of a ferriss wheel, first, i m panicked  i m jewish  it s never going to start again, and i m stuck on the ferriss wheel ''cal fussman  so, less than  100 00 ''larry king  what did i spend less than  100 00 on that did what?''cal fussman  had a positive impact on your life ''larry king  as a child, it was a yo yo because i never could master the yo yo, and it would drive me crazy  and the fact that i couldn t master it drove me crazy  so, i don t know why i just thought of that ''cal fussman  well, it would probably have been like a dodger ticket when you were a kid ''larry king  yeah ''cal fussman  now, they re more than  100 00 ''larry king  when i was a kid, one of the biggest thrills of my life was a ticket to ebbets field  i d go down to montague street and buy reserved seats when you could afford them,  1 75, to hold those tickets and look at them  now, there s a piece of paper  you put it in your phone  i don t do that  when i go to the airport, i want a boarding pass  and i d like it to be thick not paper  you can t get them  you can get pieces of paper  i m very pissed  you got me very angry, fussman ''cal fussman  first annoyed, now angry  how about what advice would you give to a college senior about to enter the real world? and what advice would you give a smart, aggressive 30 year old?''larry king  well, to a college senior, if you have goal, don t give up  if you want to do something in life, and someone can tell you you can t do it, and if you believe that, then, you can t do it ''if you think you can do it, you can do it  if you think you can do it, you can do it ''cal fussman  that s actually great advice ''larry king  and if you think you can t do it, you can t do it  and if you can do it, but you think you can t, you can t ''cal fussman  you re cooked ''larry king  you ve got to think you can do it ''cal fussman  what about a 30 year old?''larry king  a 30 year old is almost the same thing  a 30 year old, you re at that bridge  that s why i love athletes  athletes  lives, their careers end when most of ours begin  so, they face winning and losing  they face the final score  they face cheering that stops  we don t have it  no one else in life has that  most of our careers kick off around 35, 40, and that s when they re done  and also, they re getting paid for something that they did when they were 7 years old and did it for more hours ''cal fussman  how is it failure or apparent failure set you up for later success? do you have a favorite failure?''larry king  well, you learn from loss  you learn a lot more from losing than from winning ''cal fussman  well, probably the two stories you told about jamaica farewell and then falling asleep ''larry king  there were other failures, too  failure in marriage  i wasn t good at it  that s because my job came first  see, again, my love for my broadcasting has hindered me in other areas because i m driven by that  cnn and mutual radio were the no  1 things in my life, no  1  children were better, but i was a better worker than a father  i m a better father now  old age has   see, but the weird thing about old age, fussman, for the fussman factor, is i m 83 ''but i m 17  in other words, i know i m 83 from the pains and the little tribulations of life  but i m 17  for example, you know what keeps me going? i wonder what i want to do when i grow up  i like being called promising  in other words, when i get a call like you ve just been awarded a lifetime achievement award by the emmy s, which i got six years ago, lifetime achievement  ''cal fussman  that probably made you mad ''larry king  wonderful thrill, but, at the same time, is that it? you mean it s over? over? and i look at my trophy room  i have a trophy room right next door to this room  and it s got all of the accolades over the years and the awards  i go in there  it s my ego room ''but i sit in there  and i say to myself who the hell did this? who the hell   i look around at pictures and people and me with people  who the hell? how the hell did i do this? and it s just   you know, bertrand russell, the great philosopher and nobel prize winner, mathematician was 95 years old, and he had a dinner party  someone said,  dr  russell, you re 95, a great mathematician, great writer, nobel prize  what do you know? what do you know?  and he said,  the only thing i know is that i don t know   and if i had to sum up everything about human nature, about war, about life, about love, about the meaning of things, i don t know ''i ve had a lifetime of discovery  i ve learned a lot of things  but on the basic things of life, i don t know  i don t know about women  i don t know about someone looking after me  i don t know about things up there  i don t know  i guess i m an agnostic, but i just can t make that leap  i can t make the leap of faith  it s too big a leap  and when people have it, there s a sense of envy, but, at the same time, i don t mean to put them down, but a sense that they need a crutch  i don t have a crutch ''cal fussman  i have a few more questions here from tim  what are bad recommendations you hear in your area of expertise?''larry king  i don t know  i don t know how to answer that  i ve never heard people give bad recommendations  a bad recommendation would be you don t need college ''i think, today, you do  in my day, you didn t  now, you do  the world is too competitive ''cal fussman  what is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love?''larry king  unusual habit? i have a habit of   thought habits  i try to total up words in a phrase or a sentence and then divide it to see if i get an even number  like true love divided by two is four  there s four words in each things, four and four ''cal fussman  oh, the letters  i see what you re saying ''larry king  so, i don t want an odd number, i want an even number  i do that a lot in my head ''cal fussman  you re doing it while you re asking questions?''larry king  no, no, no  i try not to get distracted ''cal fussman  okay  yeah, that would be like having a calculator going off ''larry king  no, no, no ''cal fussman  but that s okay  that is unusual ''larry king  yeah  but everyone has little unusual things  for example, my pills, i take a lot of prescription pills and a lot of vitamins  they have to be in order in the closet  and when, i lay them out for the next day, i have to take them out in the same order  that s a rule ''cal fussman  well, that s control and organization  a lot of what we re talking about is about control ''larry king  i m very organized  and i hate   hate is a bad word  disorganized people annoy me  i told my wife this morning, we re having dinner at wolfgang s tonight  if you want to come over, come over ''greg is coming  i don t know who is coming  but we re having dinner at wolfgang s tonight  two hours later, i say to her we ll go at 7 30  where are we going?

48,49,49: Tim Answers Your ,"10 most popular questions   why, hello ladies and germs  this is a new episode of the tim ferris show and it is an experimental episode  i am going to answer your questions  and there were 6,831 votes on 305 questions that you all submitted  533 people submitted questions  and they were voted up and down, and i m going to answer the 10 most popular  and there are a few caveats  i may tweak some of the questions or i ll read them literally and then i ll indicate where, perhaps, i think a better question, or more precise question, or oblique question could be asked  now, without further ado, here we go into the questions  i m running to get to a movie, which, for those interested, is foxcatcher  i am a lifelong wrestler  i m very fascinated by the entire saga, and i remember when it happened, related to mr  dupont and everything else  i shall not spoil the story for those of you who don t know it  but i expect it to be very, very exciting and, at the end, very sad  okay  now, question number one  this is from matt, i think it s coughlin, in costa rica   if you were to write  the 4 hour work week 2 0  for 2014, what would you change or update from the original version? are there new tools, technology, business models, or ideas that would make it more adaptable to today s realities?  so there are a few things i would say to this  first is  yes, there are definitely tools and tactics that are new  new technologies, new sites  that could range from, say, unbounce  i think it s just unbounce com for quickly designing landing pages for testing things, different offers, etc  tools like optimizely or visual website optimizer  those are both two competitors who allow you to do very fast split testing on various different things  i used visual website optimizer for all of my most recent e mail capture testing  then you have things like kickstarter  so, if you look at the shelf like build a business competitions, and you can see a bunch of them just by going to shopify com tim, you ll notice that many of the winners used kickstarter to fundraise, but also acquire customers very, very cheaply  and i would give examples of people who have used kickstarter, for instance, as opposed to traditional financing or bootstrapping  there are then sites like vhx   i think it might just be vhx tv  if it s not that, it s vhx net   for selling video content directly to fans, or would be fans   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and what i ve realized since  the 4 hour work week  came out, is that there are many use cases and implementations i couldn t have predicted  and that ranges from superbowl actors, i kid you not, who have used  the 4 hour work week  to completely turn the rules of acting upside down, to lawyers, to hedge fund managers, to nonprofits, to families of five who are traveling around the world and making more than i could ever imagine  they re really, really incredible  so yes, the tools do change with time  it doesn t take a lot of effort to figure out what those new tools are  i shall probably do an updated version, a 10th anniversary edition, believe it or not  jesus  man, i m getting old  and the other thing is i m considering doing an entire book of case studies  basically a choose your own adventure guide to real world examples of people doing amazing things after reading  the 4 hour work week   if you have a fun story to tell, if you have a company you ve built, a muse you ve built, and you would like me to consider it for the book, please go to fourhourworkweek com success  okay? so fourhourworkweek com, all spelled out, forward slash success  there s a forum  you can submit stuff  i don t know exactly what the timeline is on this, but it s very likely that i m going to do a book  so bonus points to people who submit soon  now, as a second side note, i would just say,  the 4 hour work week  is really about timeless principles  it s not about the shiniest, latest gadget or testing mechanism  it is about first principles  and 99 percent of it is the same today as it was in 2007, when it was originally written, as it would have been, say, close to the birth of christ with seneca and the stoics in roman times  the principles of effective behavior really do not change all that much  so there you have it  alright, next question   what is the main communication technique that you use to network with people of higher status? especially before you had success   and unfortunately this gentleman s name was cut off by the printer  i apologize for that  the answer is volunteering and writing  so when i first moved to silicon valley, i volunteered with a group called the silicon valley association of startup entrepreneurs  svase org  and volunteered  and it s amazing to me how many people who volunteer do a shitty job because they re not getting paid  and that is not how you have good opportunities presented to you  i arrived here, didn t know a soul  i was driving a hand me down minivan that the seats had been stolen out of, at least the back seats  it was really ridiculous and embarrassing  but that is to say, i was starting from ground zero, just like everybody does  and i volunteered  i worked at the front desk  i did way more than i was asked to do   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and as a result, i was given more responsibility  i was viewed as more responsible and therefore became more important to the organization  and over time, and this didn t take a very long time at all, they did weekly events, practically  over the span of two or three months, i got to the point where i was able to volunteer to run an entire major event  and what that meant was, i was able to reach out  i was able to decide on the subject matter for a panel and invite all of the people i dreamed of meeting  so that included everyone from jack canfield, co creator of chicken soup for the soul, who, of course, later became very influential and helped me to find my book agent, who then sold  the 4 hour work week   and i m still in touch with jack after all these years  to ed bird, mr  creatine  he helped to develop creatine  the creator of the pet rock  the founder of cliff bar, who wasn t able to come, i think for health reasons and sent someone in his place  trip hawkins, cofounder of electronic arts  and i was the point person  i got to communicate with all of these people and i am still in touch with many of them  alright? so volunteering is a lateral move that can allow you to really get in touch with people way above your pay grade  and the other is writing  alright? so if you re a good writer, you can do interviews for respectable publications and use that as a foot in the door to have contact with people who you aspire to get to know or emulate in some fashion  pro tip  don t ask them for a favor right after interviewing them, or something like that  develop a real, human relationship with them and take your time  play the long game  that is advice i would give you gary vaynerchuck would give you, many others would  don t try to hump their leg on the first date  okay  next question  and i might not make it to 10, but i ll make it to as many as i can before i have to grab an uber and scoot out the door  alright  next question  this is ryan fisk  and the question is,  roughly, what technique do you use to focus on one idea long enough to bring it to fruition? or, if you prefer, what techniques do you use to avoid distraction while working on an idea?  really, it comes down to a handful of things  and i could tell you,  here is a tactic   again, i want to focus on principles whenever possible because they re flexible and adaptable and they don t change  the latest techniques, websites, etc , they re constantly shifting and it s a war of attrition against yourself  it s very fatiguing  but there are certain approaches, like the pomodoro technique, where you focus for, say, 45 minutes, i like to do it for even shorter, like 22 or 23 minutes, and then take a 5minute break  so it s a 20 some odd minute sprint with a 5 minute break  i like to use that  i could also point to morning rituals  i think that really specking out the first 60 minutes of your day, copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and basically having it so that it is scripted  someone else could take your morning routine and execute it, like an actor who s winning an oscar imitating you, to a t  alright? you should not burn any calories making decisions of what you re going to have for breakfast, about what you re going to do 10, 15 minutes after you wake up  it should be scripted to optimize your mental state for the rest of the day  and you want to conserve your decision making  so  the 5 minute journal   this is actually a muse  it was created by a few folks who read  the 4 hour work week   but  the 5 minute journal , it s a hardcover book, and you do a few types of journaling first thing in the morning, for five minutes or less, identifying your priorities, what you re grateful for, and a handful of other things  it s very, very fast  and that helps to re clarify your priority, not multiple priorities ideally, for the day  and last but not least, i think this is the most important  why do people get distracted? why do they jump from project to project to project and quit thing after thing after thing after thing? i think it s because, primarily, they try to be realistic, and i talk about this in  the 4 hour work week , but they aim for base hits  so let s say they re making  50,000 a year  they re like,  alright, i m going to aim to make  60,000 a year   and you re not going to move mountains for that type of incremental change  but if the goal instead is, and it s ideally not totally financial, but is to create a company that makes   again, i m just using numbers because it s easy   a million dollars a year  it s hard to fail completely, and that s something i think larry page says  when you aim high enough, it s hard to fail completely, and you need a goal that will keep you enthusiastic and excited through all of the trials and tribulations and obstacles that pop up  and whether your goal is small or your goal is huge, you will face obstacles  and if your dream is uninspiring, you will quit  and i think, primarily, that is the cause that i would point to for people repeatedly quitting things, is that their things aren t interesting enough  so there s a great book called  the magic of thinking big  by david schwartz  it was recommended to me by one of the top product inventors in the united states  he s made millions of dollars  that book was recommended to him by fortune 500 ceos  grab  the magic of thinking big , read it, and choose sexy, exciting goals or you will quit forever  alright, next question   regardless of industry, what is a trend you see developing that you think most people are missing?   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    i ll try to keep this short  this is from malcom in dc  the trend that i think a lot of people miss, and this is speculation on my part, but i think it s informed speculation, is the contraction and contamination of cycles  what does that mean? well, if we look at even the stock market, i think that what we will see, and there are inevitable short and long term cycles whether it be with energy and therefore influencing commodity trading, or equity cycles of various types, and you could talk to all sorts of people who get into fibonacci sequences and so on and so forth, but i think that the impact of social media and instantaneous dissemination, and in a way viral passing of information is underestimated for its impact on contracting cycles  so if you have, say, a historically seven year cycle, because both exuberant, irrational optimism, euphoria, can spread around the world at the snap of the fingers for some crazy dog video, it s also true with misinformation or information related to, say, stocks at ipo, whether alibaba or anything else, right? and i m not saying alibaba is overpriced  actually i hold alibaba, but i think that those seven year cycles could become five or even three year cycles or less  and similarly, it could turn out that the recovery periods are shorter  now, there are many, many, many factors that go into this, but i think that there are people out there, macro hedge fund managers and so on, who are really good at considering many, many, many, many different factors that contribute to shifts in the markets  but one that is, i think, understudied and undervalued is the contraction, the acceleration of the ups and downs due to social media and other technologies of that type  and when i say the contamination of the cycles, i mean that if things were interrelated before and there were unintended consequences of events, whether it s a terrorist blowing up an oil field in nigeria, or quantitative easing, or sovereign debt crisis in europe, the impact of those events that might seem removed from your life, your day to day life, is, i think, going to be   i think the world increasingly represents a house of cards  and previously you could have pulled out one of those cards and the entire thing would have held together, but, again, because of the contamination of these cycles and how pervasive and promiscuous information is, i think that is increasingly less so  okay  long enough  next one   what is the one thing you have to absolutely do every day, no matter what your schedule is? this is vic dulot, toronto, canada  a couple of things  meditate in the morning  i try to do that as soon as i wake up, or i m not going to do it  trends in all meditations is what i use, but you can check out guided meditations by a woman named tara brach  i think that s how you say her last name  so it s tara, b r a c h  and my interview that i did with maria popova, brain pickings, goes into this  if you want to hear more about that you could, but guided meditations is a good place to start   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and then at the end of the night   and i try to bookend my day with activities in the beginning and at the end  so in the beginning it s to set the state for the rest of the day  a calm efficiency and effectiveness  and at the end, it s to wind down and de stress and decompress from the day  so i tend to do very hot baths with epsom salts, and i ll read something, oftentimes in the bath, that is not nonfiction  so i m actually reading, i think it s naomi shihab nye, n y e  poetry, and i am not a poetry reader, but i m reading this specifically to shut down my problem solving mechanism in my head, so that i don t have insomnia  alright  here we go  next question  this ronald yao from new york city   what routines or hacks do you perform to be in a state of flow?  alright  this is a good question  now, i will say, i ve thought about this a lot recently, and i don t really like the phrase state of flow or the term flow  i think it s very overused right now, and as a result under defined  it s lost a lot of meaning, so i would like to change the phrasing of the question to   what routines or hacks do you perform to achieve effortless output?  so flow to me means effortless output, whether it s when you re drawing and suddenly before you this amazing piece of art is created that seemingly comes from outside of you  it is an effortless output  or, in writing  or in negotiating flawlessly  effortless output  alright  i ll come back to routine  the first 60 minutes of your day should be robotic  it should be slow, it should be unrushed, and it should be scripted  alright? so decide what the sequence of events is  if you had to give someone a word document to imitate your day perfectly, the first 60 minutes  what would it look like? and there are other things that contribute biochemically  for instance, intravenous glutathione, or even liposomal glutathione, for me, kind of lights me up a little bit  and there are different types of tea, like your bromonte with three different stimulants or so with different pharmacokinetic profiles  blah, blah, blah, blah  the last thing, which is not the last in importance, is exercise  alright, so, very simply, and this is also the answer to either julia or julio from the netherlands who asked,  how do you kick yourself in the butt out of a lazy, half depressive mindset into a productive and positive mindset?  exercise, exercise, exercise  the brain is an organ, alright? so don t separate mind and body  if you want to improve your mental performance, including neurogenesis and increasing brain drive, neurotrophic factor, and all of these very physical, biochemical, or even physiological changes, exercise  so jump on a rower or a bike, it can be a stationary bike, for 10 to 20 minutes  that s plenty  when i m in a funk, one of the first things i ll do is jump into my garage  i have a concept 2 rower and i ll jump onto it, and i will literally only row for 500 meters  it s nothing  but it is enough to provide me with an injection of neurotransmitters and also copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    vasodilatation in large muscle groups like the legs  it s enough to click me out of that funk  so that is also an important part of flow  i m experimenting with motion  repetitive motion that is lateral, so whether that s skiing or surfing, something that gives me lateral awareness, and this is true  steven kotler talked about this in  the rise of superman  in his experience with surfing, very similarly, which contributed to his recovery from lyme disease, which i m very interested in  okay  so, let s keep going  the next one is,  if you ever get mentally overwhelmed by things you want to do, how do you get to say,  okay, this year i want to concentrate on x, this month i want to focus on y,  without feeling you re missing out on something else  okay  this is a good question  this is from stephano in italy slash the uk  so, alright  how do you choose something to do and focus on it without feeling you re missing out on something else? i think the easiest way to address this is to recognize that you are missing out on something else, always, when you make a decision  and in fact, if you at the etymology   i always mix this up  entomology, i think, is insects, etymology   because look at the etymology of the word decision  it s related to incision  decision is to cut away  you re removing other options  and that s not a bad thing, and i think if you think of it as the heath brothers who wrote  made to stick , who wrote in of their more recent books,  it s not about thinking outside of the box  you want to look for the right box, the right set of constraints that will facilitate you achieving your different objectives   the point being there s always an opportunity cost  you choose to do anything, there are other things you are, therefore, not simultaneously doing  okay? and you have to be okay with that and you should be okay because that s reality  until you learn how to clone yourself and teleport and so on, that s the case  so it s okay  you don t have to do everything  and you can do anything, but you want to choose the lead domino  this is how i think of my projects  so, for instance, if i can work on a television show, executive producing a television show, or   which i did, which was a very difficult process   or i could focus on a book, or a i could focus on, say, collecting e mails, or i can focus on continually writing blog posts, which do return dividends, or i can focus on investing in startups  which of those will facilitate all of the others? so if each of those by themselves takes 10 units of energy and a year of time, i m just making that up, but 10 units of energy and a year of time, which one can i choose as the lead domino so that when i knock it over, all of the other ones take less energy and less time  does that make sense?  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and for me, that was television  i focused on television and co produced and hosted this show called the tim ferriss experiment  and many of you know that the division that produced that at turner broadcasting got shut down, so it s sitting on a shelf  so, here s the point  i chose to go after that lead domino and it didn t work out, as of now  i m working on solving that problem  but do i regret having made that decision? no  and this is another important thing, is that you shouldn t judge your success based on outcomes by themselves  because you can, for instance, go into the stock market, behave very, very badly, and dangerously, and have a fluke outcome that s really good  and you don t want to reward that, you don t want to think that you re suddenly a stock market genius because you got lucky  you want to focus on good process, whether or not you have good outcomes or bad outcomes because there are things outside of your control  so for me, i don t regret having done the tv, even though i spent a year, year and a half, almost exclusively on it, and there were a lot of opportunity costs  that cost me millions of dollars not to focus on other things  and i don t regret it because it was the right lead domino  another way to think about it is which of these problems are really problems? in other words, if you re sitting in a car, metaphorically, and you have a flat tire or a rapidly deflating tire, let s pretend it s the winter, the defroster doesn t work so the windshield is fogging up, and you have a broken driver side mirror  okay  what should you focus on? if you re very constrained with time, you re in a rush, you don t have a lot of resources, you re by yourself  what should you focus on? well, what i would say is   do you need to fix the mirror? do you need to fix the defroster? do you need to fix the flat tire?  because keep in mind, the problem isn t that the defroster is broken, the problem is that the windshield is fogging up  so yes, you can fix that  you can open up the windows, for instance  broken mirror on the left  is that the problem? no  spotting other cars and so on behind you is the goal  can you achieve that another way? sure  you can tweak the remaining mirrors in the car to pull that off or you can do the grandparent thing and look behind yourself and glance out the window  you can do that  alright  so that s a solvable problem  the most terminable problem if not addressed is the flat tire, so that s where you should focus your time  alright  next one   what elements from  the 4 hour body  are still important to your daily regimen? what does your workout currently look like?  alright, so right now i m recovering from lyme disease  i have ligament tears in my elbows, my hips, my knees  it s fucking terrible  but there are a few things i m focusing on  repopulating my microbiome, and i talk about this in  the 4 hour body  quite extensively, and that means i m avoiding things copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    like splenda that disrupt gut bacteria, for instance, and artificial sweeteners  i am also doing micronutrient testing as outlined in  the 4 hour body   so i ve identified that i have a very low vitamin d, which can be thought of as a hormone in a lot of ways  i have low levels of a few b vitamins, so i m consuming n acetyl cysteine with l methylfolate because i m genetically predisposed to being a bad methylater  don t have time right now to go into what that means  and i m consuming the fermented cod liver and grass fed butter pills that i recommend in  the 4 hour body  as well  so, there s really nothing that comes to mind that i would change, necessarily, in  the 4 hour body , other than putting in case studies for every chapter because readers have outperformed me and outdone me in every single chapter in the book  it s been awesome  because my goal is to create readers who are better than i am at everything i discuss  otherwise, what s the point? you re just making the world worse over time  so i m trying to create students who surpass their teacher as quickly as possible  i want to make myself obsolete as quickly as possible, which is why i don t like the term guru, when the media uses that to apply to be because barf  last thing i want is people to be dependent on me  that would be antithesis of what i m going for  so there are the supplements  as for exercise, i m focusing on mobility primarily because i cannot focus on a high degree of strength training, with heavy weights, for instance, or even sub maximal weights  because my elbows are so painful at the moment, and i have such tendinopathy and neuropathy that i can t really bend my arms  i can t experience flexion at the elbow while holding onto weights  it sucks really badly  but doing swimming, calisthenics, you can think of yoga without all the mystical woo woo stuff, and breathing exercises while i m doing these calisthenics, which tend to focus on thoracic spine mobility and hips  so, squatting motions, hip hinges, without a kettle bell though, so i m just doing dead lifting like hip hinging  okay  that s that  and then the last question that i m going to have time to answer is   how do you balance your desire to challenge and improve yourself with enjoying indulgences provided by a successful life?  i think that s it  and i apologize  the name got cut off in this one as well  for me, it s pretty simple  i ve realized that money is currency and you can use it as wampum, to trade for possessions or experiences, and all things equal it s better to have more money than less, of course  but i have a very low burn rate in my life, and i think that s correlated to a high degree of control over my time   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    when you have more control over your time, you don t have to compete with the jones s, with your friends who are investment bankers or management consultants, to buy the nice car  because with time, you can produce experiences that have the benefit of allowing you to learn things that also provide you a huge advantage over possessions  and that is the anticipation of experiences  so, for instance, i m taking my entire family on an international trip for christmas  and the anticipation has made this gift incredibly valuable and exciting in the months preceding the actual delivery of said experience  right? so, i ve realized since i don t have to compete in, say, my off hours on the weekend to show my friends my new toys because i m otherwise consumed with 80 hour work weeks doing something i dislike  and as a result, i still drive a used volkswagen golf that i bought in 2004 and the antenna was ripped off by a homeless guy and i don t care because i don t listen to the radio much anyway  whatever  and that s not to say that i m a holier than thou ascetic  i do enjoy certain things  so i don t have a ton of expensive habits, but, for instance, i love japan  i m a japan a pholic, i ve spent a ton of time there  so i have japanese armor in my house  i have a couple of japanese saddles from the 1800s or even, perhaps, earlier, 1700s probably, that are worth more than my car because i have a history with something called yabusame, japanese horse back archery  and if you search my name and yabusame, y a b u s a m e, you can see a video of me learning to do horse back archery  it is really dangerous and insane, and i don t recommend it  so, luxury to me is not owning a lot of stuff  luxury to me is feeling unrushed  it is designing a life that allows you to do what you want with high leverage, with many options, feeling unrushed  so i will end on that  i m going to go head the movie  speaking of being unrushed  i do have to kind of shimmy or i m going to get chastised by my friends  so, i ll let you get going  let me know what you think of this format, if you like these questions, me answering your questions  if you enjoyed this, please let me know and i ll do more of it  on twitter  t f e r r i s s  or let me know on the blog  and thank you so much for listening   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    "
101,105,105: 5 Morning Rituals ,"that help me win the day show notes and links at tim blog podcast  if you win the morning, you win the day  this is tim ferriss  sorry for that bit of inspiration from the animal realm  i'm reading a book by joseph campbell  it's actually a collection of volumes, the way of the animal powers  historical outlets of world mythologies the first  it's massive but really amazing and nobody besides joseph campbell really could've written this book, i don't think, but i digress  this episode of the tim ferriss show is a bit of an experiment  typically i interview people who are world class at what they do and i ask them many, many questions to try to pull out, to tease out the tactics, tools, habits, routines, etcetera that make them very good at what they do  and you have, as listeners, asked me many times, why don't you answer your own questions? and i wanted to answer one of them that i get asked a lot, and that is, what does your morning routine look like? what do the first 60 to 90 minutes of your day look like? so i'm gonna answer that and you can let me know if you like this type of short episode  so hit me up on twitter or facebook twitter at tferriss t f e rr i s s or on facebook facebook com timferriss with two rs and two ss and let me know if you like this, want more of them, hate them, never want me to do one again, whatever  so i am going to describe the five things that i do every morning  now the five things i do every morning would be on an ideal day  and the reality is if i hit three out of these five, i've won the morning  and if you win the morning, you win the day  and i'm not the first person to say that but i think it is a good encapsulation of how to think about morning routines  it is setting up your entire day for positive momentum and fewer distractions  number one, let's get started, meow  number one is you make your bed  and i had not done this for my entire life and then chanced upon meeting a gentleman, a monk from india named dandapani and his website is dandapani org  i met him at master mind talks in toronto in 2011 and he convinced me to start making my bed  and i was going through a very scattered period in my life at that point  i felt like my energy was traveling sort of a millimeter in a million directions and wasn't being harnessed properly  and he convinced me to start making my bed  and if a monk is too much for you, if that's too woo woo, number one i would say, open your mind, you savage  but number two i would say this is a common belief among copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    many, very high achieving military tacticians and folks who have been deployed  for instance, naval admiral william mcraven  he has spoken about this in commencement speeches  and i'll just read his explanation first  this is from a university of texas at austin commencement speech  ""if you make your bed every morning you'll have accomplished the first task of the day  it will give you a small sense of pride and it will encourage you to do another task and another and another  by the end of the day that one task completed will have turned into many tasks completed  making your bed will also reinforce the fact that little things in life matter "" now i would add to this  i would say that in my life as a solo printer   in effect i haven't built a large organization to support me, it's a very lean team of just a few people   there's a lot of uncertainty  there are many unpredictable problems that will always pop up and there are few things that help me in that type of life  number one is reading, for instance, marcus aurelius and meditations where he prompts himself in the morning by effectively reading or writing out, i'm going to encounter many ungrateful, rude people today and i need to prepare myself for that inevitability, so not expecting the best  preparing for the worst, hoping for the best but prompting yourself and preparing yourself mentally to address all this uncertainty and so on  the second is to control what you can control     no matter how shitty your day is, no matter how catastrophic it might become, you can make your bed  and that gives you the feeling, at least gives me the feeling, even in a disastrous day, that i've held on by a fingernail off the cliff and i haven't fallen  there is something i've controlled, there is something that has maintained one hand on the driver's wheel of life  and making your bed, it's a very small thing  it doesn't have to be complicated  all i do is i have say a blanket or a duvet  i don't tuck in the sheets and whatever  i kinda just hide it, and i think that's a typical dude move, hide it under the blanket, pull up the blanket so that the pillows are either kind of symmetrically under or on top of the blanket and you're done  that's it  it's very, very simple  and if you work from home, this serves double duty, especially if you work in or near your bedroom     if you see a distraction externally, again, speaking personally, you end up creating an internally distracted state  at least that's very true for me, i'm highly visual  if i sit at a restaurant, for instance, i have to position my chair so that i'm not facing some type of tv with sports on it  i will not be able to talk to anyone  it's like taking a puppy out and having squirrels running around  i can't concentrate  so similarly, the more organized, not necessarily clean, but organized your external environment or environments that you visit repeatedly, the less stressed you will be  and that is particularly important in this case with the bookends of the day  so you make your bed, you have accomplished that one tiny task, you've controlled something that you can absolutely control  and then at the end of the day, the last experience you have is coming back to something that you've accomplished  it's hard for me to overstate how important this ritual has become but number one, i make my bed  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    number two, i meditate and this took me a long time to start  those of you who have listened to this podcast for some time have noticed, i'm sure, and this was not through any attempt at planning on my part, but 80 percent, i would say, or so of all over the world class performers across all the disciplines that we've covered have some type of meditative practice, whether that is in the gym or transcendental meditation  arnold schwarzenegger even did it for a year and then found those benefits to persist past that year  so he felt like he had sort of locked in a phase shift  transcendental meditation is one option, tm org  you can check it out  there's things i dislike about it  i think that the amount they charge for the four day initial course is too high  i think that there is some guru worship that you can steer clear of, as i did  i'm pretty secular, but it is very well tested  and the teaching method is standardized  so i found this very helpful  and tm is focused on a mantra  and i hate that word, it's too loaded, but you basically have a sound that you repeat for a period of time with your eyes closed  you can sit comfortably or lay down  you don't have to get into the full lotus or anything like that     and that acts effectively as white noise to block out other thoughts  and they would probably describe this in a different way  but i will just say the practice is bringing your attention back to the mantra  so if you have a session, that is a 20 minute session, i typically meditate for 21 minutes, about a minute to get settled and then 20 minutes of meditation  and if you think about that kid who punched you in 6th grade and the dick you have to have a conference call with at 4 00 pm that day, if you think about those types of things for 19 minutes or 19 and a half minutes but you notice it and bring your attention back to the mantra, that is a successful session because the muscle you're working is bringing your attention back to something  you are developing your powers of concentration and it is definitely like a muscle that needs continual conditioning and reinforcement  so i use tm  there are other options but  inaudible  meditation, i do use some sessions where i focus on my breath but quite frankly i think the easiest place to start is either   and it doesn't have to be mutually exclusive, you could do both of these   headspace app or calm  start using that in meditations  other good guided meditations you could check out include tara brach b r a c h who's been on this podcast  great episode talking about a lot of these issues and topics, and sam harris  sam harris has a phd in neuroscience  i think it's just samharris org h a r r i s and he has a fantastic lecture on video about all of the sort of neuroscience and philosophy behind a lot of these practices  and that is waking up  so you can check out waking up if you like and the easiest way to find that is just to go to fourhourworkweek com vineal all spelled out  but suffice to say, i meditate first thing in the morning  start small, rig the game so you can win it  get in five sessions before you get too ambitious with length   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    so start, for instance, if you don't wanna use any of that stuff, you could just start with a song that puts you in a good mood, sitting with your back supported somehow and listening to that song as you focus on your breathing  it could be that simple but do five days, in other words five daily sessions before you get too ambitious  you have to win those early sessions to establish it as a habit so you don't have the sort of cognitive fatigue of that particular practice, in any case  so number two, transcendental meditation or some type of meditative practice  and if you take that ten or twenty minutes for instance, and i find with my practice, 15 minutes is just letting the mud settle and then the last five minutes are really where i get the benefit  it's much like training to failure in the gym for me  you will still get benefits out of shorter sessions     but if i put in those 20 minutes i will get 30 to 50 percent more done in that day with less stress  why? because i have already done the warm up to avoid distraction  and if i do get distracted or interrupted i can return to my primary task more effectively  that is number two  number three, i hang  what does this mean? i actually hang multiple times throughout the day and at night  and this is primarily to decompress my spine and also to improve grip strength  but there are a number of people you can look to for more developed thoughts on all this  ido portal is one  ido i d o portal p o r t a l  i think i've just spelled that in english  and i don't have much exposure to him but many of the listeners to this podcast have recommended him  so i did check out one of his short articles, it might've been a video, on hanging throughout the day  and so i have a rig that i built in my backyard which is one and a quarter inch  i would probably recommend most people start with 1"" diameter galvanized pipe  and i bought this from plumbing supply and i built the pull up rig outside in the span of about ten minutes and it cost, i would say, less than  150 dollars, and is not intended for kipping, not good for kipping  but if you wanna see how i put it together, i also have some rings and then i used kayak dry bags instead of sand bags, which you can put water inside of, in fact, and use as kettle balls and so on when you're traveling instead of using them to keep things dry  so there's a photo  you can check it out on my instagram  just go to instagram com timferriss with two rs and two ss and you can check out that rig  but i will hang by my hands throughout the day for perhaps one minute at a time just as a way of breaking up work sessions or writing sessions or fill in the blank  at the end of the day, particularly if i do any type of weigh training that loads the spine, i will hang upside down  and i hand upside down using teeter hang up gravity boots  and these teeter hang up gravity boots cost around  99  i actually have multiple pairs around the country so that i don't have to travel with them because they're a hassle to travel with  so i have one pair in new york, one pair in sf, one pair in la that just lives at a gym actually lives at a gym that i go to because i don't have a home in la   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    the purpose here again is to decompress and you can work up to a point where you're even holding weights for short, short periods of time, say five seconds  the gravity boots can be dangerous so talk to your doctor   i must say this, i'm not an md, don't blame it on the internet   before doing anything like this, particularly if you have preexisting back conditions  other options, so there are times when i don't wanna hang upside down  maybe i just had a big dinner, maybe i just had a bunch to drink, don't really feel like hanging upside down by myself and perhaps getting the most miserable acid reflux of all time  in those cases or if i just don't have a place to hang upside down, i will use something called the lynx back stretcher l y n x  and you're basically laying on the ground, locking your feet in place and then doing a dipping motion of the top range to decompress your spine, again for very short periods of time, five to seven seconds, let's say  that is another option and people do love inversion tables  they are used widely for pt and other things  they just take up a ton of room so i don't want half of my living room taken up with an inversion table  i don't have a garage so i prefer to either use the boots, and you don't have to have your own pull up rig of course  you can go to any crossfit gym across the country and find a bar to hang from  or you can use this lynx device and i use both every day unless i have some type of injury that precludes it  so that's number three, hang  number four is tea  so just do a quick recap  make my bed, sit down and meditate for 21 minutes, get up go jump up on the bar, hang for a couple of minutes, maybe go from one hand to the other, maybe do a couple of sort of toes to bar with straight legs which is a crossfit move and then drop  then i go in, i throw on the tea, the kettle and i will boil water  and a lot of you tea nerds will take issue with this but that's okay  i use a very cheap kettle here  at home i have some fancier stuff from breville, makes a very good tea preparer for instance, what makes a great kettle and they make a very good tea infuser  so if you wanna get fancy, breville b r e v i l l e has some great stuff  but for expedience, if that's a real word, and simplicity right here i have one that is called utilitea, utilitea t e a  and i believe that's from adagio a d a g i o  and i think it costs 20 to 40 bucks on amazon  very easy to find  so i'll throw that on, boil water  while the water is warming up i'll prepare my tea  and the tea i typically brew in a small glass container, it's a rishi  inaudible  r i s h i, and that'll come up again  and i use loose leaf  and it looks like a simple french press  you could, in fact, use a french press if you wanted  and i will put in aged pu erh tea, p u hyphen e r h  this is a black tea from china  it's very peaty, it smells kind of like a wet horse's ass  why i know that is another story, and it's very earthy and it's an acquired taste  but i will break off a piece of this frisbee of aged dried pu erh tea, drop it in there  i will also add turmeric and ginger tea  i usually get mine from rishi but you could also just shave fresh turmeric and ginger very easily  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and i've done that before  if i'm sick i will shave fresh ginger  if i'm sick i will also add minced garlic but i'm getting ahead of myself  so we have the pu erh tea, we have turmeric and ginger tea  i will also add in some green tea  now this is where the connoisseurs of tea leaves will be like, blasphemy  i need some more caffeine  anyway, blasphemy, blasphemer  that's where i was trying to get fancy  that's what i was gonna say  and they'll get very upset because they'll say, you know tim ferriss, you should really do your homework because the steeping temperatures for those teas are all different  and if you're using this blunt instrument of boiling water, you're just an idiot and giving bad advice  well, i'll tell you what  i'm glad to be the idiot if i give people advice that's easy to follow and is the gateway drug into then exploring the complexity of tea  so let's just call a truce and keep it simple  185 degrees is fine so i will not pour boiling water into the leaves because i can't drink boiling water and it takes too long to cool down  so i will boil it or you can set it to not boil, but i'll usually boil it and then just let it kinda sit there for say three to five minutes  after three to five minutes, it's fine  it's a little too hot for me to stick my finger in for more than like a half a second but it's plenty hot to do what i want to do  i will then let it steep for say the first infusion i'll keep short, and some people will say, 10 to 20 seconds  look, i mean, let's keep life simple  i'll usually do it for say a minute  and then i will pour it into my mug and my mug will have any number of different oils in it  my favorite is coconut oil, so virgin coconut oil  i will put in my cup, it's about 70 percent by weight medium chain triglycerides  i've written a blog post called i think it's   it's a joke people   called titanium tea  the name is just a tongue in cheek joke but very similar to what you might consider bullet proof coffee  so if i have some cary gold butter or something like that i might put in a little of both  but my preference is coconut oil  i just like it and it seems to get all of my cylinders firing  so that is what i do with the tea, right  so flip it on, make it hot  i'll usually prepare my puppy's food while i'm doing that, feed the dog  and i'll do that right now by hand  training the dog is a whole separate episode  and then i'll come back, the tea has boiled and has already cooled off, then i'll make my own tea while the dog chills in a crate and works on a kong, if you wanna look that up, that has been frozen the night before  but the tea, again, has pu erh tea, you can get all this stuff on amazon, pu erh tea and i have links in the titanium tea blog post if you wanna check that out  so pu erh tea, the rishi ginger and turmeric tea and than a bit of green tea  and you can choose whatever green tea you like  dragon well is quite tasty  if somebody wants to try that out it's long jing cha is what it is in chinese, l o n g is dragon long, jing is well, cha is tea c h a second tone  so bruce lee, for instance, for those people interested, i'm glad you asked, is lee xiaolong  lee xiaolong is lee, that's his last name, xiaolong is little dragon  that was his nickname  there are many, many other names and action stars who have that dragon in their name  all right, i digress   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    so let's go through the roll call  make the bed, meditate, hang, make the tea, sit down with the tea and the next thing i do is journal  and there are number of different options for journaling  i usually do one and not both  there is the five minute journal  you should check it out  it's a great little journal and it allows you to establish not only achievement for the day or expectations of achievement, because you're identifying your top priorities, you're identifying your top behaviors or attributes  so there is that component  and then you're also establishing gratitude for what you already have or have done or the people around you  this is very important and it's easy to become obsessed with pushing the ball forward as a type a personality and you end up a perfectionist who's always future focused  the five minute journal is a    therapeutic intervention, for me at least because i am that person, that allows me to not only get more done during the day but to also feel better throughout the entire day, to be a happier person, to be a more content person, which is not something that comes naturally to me  i think a lot of my drive comes from constant dissatisfaction so this is very helpful medicine  the five minute journal  you can look it up  on a side note or maybe, i think, a very cool side note is that that journal was created as a muse by people who read the four hour work week  so that's a very full circle fun anecdote  the other type of journaling that i also do is morning pages  and i won't spend a lot of time on this but if you simply google tim ferriss morning journal, i have actually scanned examples of my own morning journals and what those look like with the morning pages specifically  and i talk about why i journal, the different reasons  and one of them is, in the case of morning pages, is to take whatever anxiety and monkey mind self talk could interfere with the rest of the day and to trap it on the page so that i can get the fuck on with my day  and that is it, folks  so again, these are five things but let's be realistic, i don't always hit these five because if you add them all up it's probably anywhere from 60 to 120 minutes  that's bullshit  it's maybe 60 minutes, i would say, all said and done  you know what? why do i keep on making such large numbers? it's not true  it's like 30 to 60 minutes  and there are days when life intervenes and you have emergencies you have to deal with  but you can always do at least one of these  and if you just tick off three, i find for me personally that the likelihood of that day being a homerun is infinitely greater  so again, you have make your bed, you have meditate and that could be very, very short, just a few minutes with an app like headspace or calm  then you have hang, so you can figure out a way to hang or decompress using something like the lynx  then tea and then journal, whether that's five minute journal, morning pages or something else  so i hope you enjoyed this episode  that's all i have for you now and let me know if you'd like more or less or what you would like  please let me know on twitter  so that's t f e r r i s s on

109,113,113: 5 Tools I Use for Faster and Better Sleep ,"show notes and links at tim blog podcast hello boys and girls  this is tim ferriss and welcome to another episode of the tim ferriss show  this is an in between isode, a short little morsel that i sometimes do in place of the longer format interviews, which are often one, two, three hours in length and involve deconstructing world class performers from the worlds of finance, sports, music, art, everything in between  but this time we re going to talk about sleep, because many of you have been asking for more in between isodes, and i thought i would touch upon some of the tools and approaches that i have found very helpful for facilitating not only rapid onset of sleep, but higher quality sleep  i have struggled with insomnia for most of my adult life, and that would be onset insomnia  if these things can work for me, i think they can work for many of you, as well  so here we go  i'm going to talk about five or so things that have really helped me, very, very directly  the first is something called the chilipad, and that is spelled c h i l i pad  this was introduced to me by either rick ruben, the legendary music producer, or kelly starrett  kelly starrett, mobilitywod, famed cross fit coach  both of these guys recommended the chili pad before i bought one  what the chili pad entails is a thin sheet that you put under your normal bed sheets  a unit next to the bed circulates water through that sheet  you can modulate the temperature between 55 degrees and 110 degrees fahrenheit  so you can use it to keep cool and you can use it to heat yourself up  what makes it very unique is you have multiple zones  so let s just say you are sleeping with a partner in a bed and many women are like space heaters  they run so hot  yet, they re under three or four blankets  and i've heard this from many, many guys who have to sleep with one leg on top of the sheet, and then they get cold and they put it under, and then they overheat, etc  the chili pad solves all of this  but even if you re not with someone else, it is extremely effective for, in most cases, allowing you to sleep cool but very comfortable and get to sleep sooner, but dramatically improve also the quality of your sleep and feeling of restfulness in the morning  this has been a game changer for i know both rick and kelly, and i've experienced it myself  and friends that i've recommended it to in silicon valley have said, in several cases  tim, have loved your advice, read the book for years  this is the single biggest game changer that you ve introduced me to  the chili pad, it s not inexpensive but check it out and you can make your own decision  you can get it on amazon or other places  chilipad  c h i l i p a d  that is number one  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    number two is hanging upside down  i've spoken about this in other podcasts so i'm not going to spend a ton of time on it  but this was recommended to me by an olympic weight lifter who has four or five world records, is in his 60s and can still throw hundreds of pounds overhead and land in an ass to heels squat, snatch position  he s a beast  he can also do that on a wobble board, like an indo board, just to give you an idea of the shape this guy is in  one of his principles is hanging upside down after any weight training session  what i've taken that to mean for my own life, even when i'm not on a training day, and this is a controversial  00 09 00  term but decompressing the spine or elongating the spine, at the very least, by hanging upside down using, in my case, gravity boots  teeter hang up gravity boots, t e e t e r are what i use  there are a number of different options out there  that can have some safety risks, since they re basically ski boots with hooks on them and you flip yourself upside down and hang upside down, from, say, a standard pull up bar or something like that  you could use an inversion table  teeter makes those, as well, which is much easier to control  or you could use a device that allows you to stretch the spine on the floor  there s something called the lynx, l yn x  teeter also makes one of these devices and i will often have all of them in my house in various places  since not all nights do i want to go into the garage, strap on these ski boots, flip upside down, and in some cases, hold weights then to further emphasize the traction of sorts  so hanging upside down, that would be number two  i should emphasize that you don t need to do all of these things  if you add even one or two of these, i think each can have a tremendous effect on your onset and quality of sleep  next, we have sleep mask and ear plugs  i'm going to count this as one unit  that doesn t sound very interesting or original until i tell you very, very specifically what i'm using  i've tried every sleep mask imaginable, and most of them suck balls  they re terrible  they re so uncomfortable  they fall off, they get twisted on your face  they re just the worst  earplugs, ditto  so i have found two models in each respect that work tremendously well  the sleep master sleep mask, cheesy name, great product  sleep master sleep mask  this was introduced to me by a friend named jeffrey zurofsky  some of you may recognize his name  he was jz, a chef in the four hour chef who was very, very involved with the entire process  we did the food marathon together, among other things, in new york city  so the sleep master sleep mask'  a few things make this very interesting  number one, it s basically satin so it s very, very comfortable  it s not rough  it doesn t have edges on it that would bother you  the most important feature, i think, is that it goes over your ears, not on top of your ears  this seems like a very minor detail and it turns out to be a huge design change  that means a number of things  it quiets things down for you  it doesn t irritate your ears  it doesn t move around a lot  and number three, if you are in a very hot room, it could be a little toasty for you  but the sleep master sleep mask, check it out  it s fantastic  also it doesn t use elastic  it uses velcro on the very back  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    the ear plugs, i've tried a lot of ear plugs and the ear plugs i ended up using more often are the 3m   and get ready for the worst product name ever   ear soft fx, spelled e hyphen a hyphen r, lower case s o f t f x  so 3m, e a rsoft fx  these are disposable ear plugs that i often reuse until they lose their bounce  you ll get a box of these on amazon for like  20, and they re industrial strength  i absolutely love these things and travel with them constantly  so those are three  we have chilipad, we have hanging upside down, we have the sleep mask and ear plugs  next we have tea  i had laughed at my girlfriend because she drank this tea, and i was like oh, that must be very helpful for   at the time   menstrual cramps but i don t really need it  and the branding is very targeted at women  but this is specifically yogi soothing caramel bedtime tea  it supports a good night s sleep  rain forest alliance certified  so it s got a lot going on, here  but yogi, soothing caramel bedtime tea  i saw this and i remember i was at home alone one night  my girlfriend was out for some reason  i was like oh, i'll have some tea  i don t feel like having anything caffeinated but i want something with flavor  i drank this tea  i let it brew for maybe five minutes and i felt like leonardo dicaprio in the pay phone scene from wolf of wall street where he s taken too many quaaludes and it all hits him at once  i felt like i had been hit with a tranq dart and had to, in the most awkward fashion possible, drag myself to the bedroom, and just go to sleep  i was very impressed by how strong this stuff is  your mileage may vary  you may find that it seems ridiculously ineffective for you but for whatever reason, this stuff knocks me out even more so than something i used to use, which i think also has applications and that s just straight california poppy that you can put in drops in, say, water  alright  so that s the tea  another option, another brand is something called sleepytime tea  but this one, to start with, they also have the worst fortunes mantras on these tags imaginable  i have no idea who they paid in some non native english speaking country to put these together but they are kind of hilarious at times  so yogi soothing caramel bedtime tea  and then last but not least, we have visual overwriting  that s not a term i've heard used but that s the way i think of it  this is what you do right before bed to, in effect, crowd out whatever is replaying in your mind, or whatever you happen to be obsessing about that is going to inhibit sleep  so that could be email, that could be things you have to do the next morning  that could be an argument or debate you had that day  it could be any number of things  but if you re anything like me, you lay down at night and for whatever reason, that s when your brain decides to rev up  meditation helps a lot with this  i've talked about my morning routines before, which include meditation so i'm not going to repeat this hear  you can listen to that short podcast if you want my morning routines  meditation helps a lot to dial down the volume and frequency and intensity of this internal chatter at night  copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    but what also helps very, very much is either playing tetris for ten minutes, and this can also be applied to ptsd and other things  you can listen to my interview on this podcast with jane mcgonigal on game design and using games for everything from weight loss to mitigating the damage from traumatic brain injury, ptsd, etc  tetris for ten minutes, i won t get into all the explanation but that can be very, very helpful for the visual overwriting for purposes of sleep  the other option, which i take advantage of all the time, is short episodic television  i'll give you one particular recommendation  if you ve ever dreamed or fantasized   that bell in the background is my puppy doing back flips on the floor for some reason  if you ve ever fantasized about just saying fuck it, quitting your job and going back to the land  getting out of the city and going to montana or going to god knows where in some rural utopia and tilling the soil and making your own food and whatnot, then escape to river cottage, season one is what you have to watch  it s a really, really good episode  it features the celebrity chef, hugh fearnley whittingstall, most british name ever  fantastic host, excellent chef and really a good, philosophical exploration and pragmatic reality check of what it means to go from city slicker to farmer, effectively, or homesteader  it s a really great series  i really enjoyed it  it s very retro in a way that i find endearing, and engaging in away that is sort of modern cgi has lost some of its lure  so those are the five points  i'm not going to make this any longer than it has to be  chilipad, hanging upside down, the sleep master sleep mask with the 3m ear plugs that i mentioned, the yogi soothing caramel bedtime tea, and then using some type of visual overwriting, whether that is ten minutes of tetris before bed on a dimmed screen, don t forget that, or escape to river cottage season one, or other episodic television  and if you haven t signed up for five bullet friday, please do that  that s my closing request  five bullet friday is the little sampling of awesomeness, hopefully  the most interesting things that i have found or experimented with in a given week  and that s a short email with five bullets  it goes out every friday  you can check that out by going to fourhourworkweek com friday  just go to fourhourworkweek com, all spelled out, forward slash friday  or go to fourhourworkweek com and just fill out your email there  it s free  alright, guys  thanks very much for listening  until next time, keep up the experimentation, sleep well, and take care   copyright

122,126,126: 25 Great Things ,"i ve learned from podcast guests show notes and links at tim blog podcast hello, ladies and germs  this is tim ferris, and welcome to the tim ferris show  holiday edition  i am on a small island in an undisclosed location, chilling with my little pup molly who has been extremely aggressive in pursuing coconuts and cats  i m travelling with a set of rings, mini parallettes, and a jump rope  that s pretty much all you need to keep in shape  and pro tip, if you re going to travel with rings, travel with wooden rings instead of plastic, that way you don t need to bring as much, if any, chalk  but this episode, unlike the longer form interviews   which i do for one to three hours at a time with folks ranging from arnold schwarzenegger to chess prodigy josh waitzkin and everyone in between   this is an in between isode  it s a small little morsel intended to give you a taste of whatever s on my mind  in this case, we are going to talk about what i ve learned in 2015 from podcast guests , and i went through the whole roster because i ve been trying to do more reflection and less ingestion  all i mean by that is, i use reading books, consuming information as procrastination, and i ve decided that i should spend more   at least half of my time   reflecting upon and digesting what i ve already read, what i ve already listened to  and that s what i did with my podcast to date this year  i went through the entire list of all the guests and tried to identify the nuggets that i ve implemented in my own life that are of great value  so, hopefully, you ll be able to use some of these  and if you haven t heard these episodes, i highly recommend that you go back and listen to one or two because we get caught up in neomania very easily  that s an expression i picked up from n  n  taleb, writer of the black swan, and that is an obsession with the new  if it s not a new podcast, if it came out a week ago, a month ago, a year ago, it no longer has value  and, of course, that s bullshit  the longer these episodes are able to sustain themselves, the longer they survive in the slipstream of digital information that s assaulting us all, the more value they do have  and many of these episodes i m going to mention still get more than 100,000 downloads per month without any trouble   and, in some cases, per week  so these are doing very, very well, and they are remaining relevant  but before we get to the lessons, a quick request  two of my episodes from this year   podcast episodes   have been nominated by product hunt as podcast episode of the year  and i would really love your help, if you enjoyed these, to vote for them  this is a voting procedure  so, if you could go to fourhourworkweek   all spelled out   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    fourhourworkweek com foxx   or fox   that will forward to jamie foxx s episode which was just incredible and blew me away as well as many other folks  so if you enjoyed that episode, please vote for it  and you can vote for both, by the way  it s among many others that are competing  so, fourhourworkweek com   all spelled out   forward slash fox will take you there  it takes five seconds to click the up carrot   the up arrow   and then you re done  the other episode is naval ravikant, and the name of that episode was the person i call most for startup advice which was a very illuminating episode  and his name and jamie s will pop up in my list of lessons  but to upvote that, just go to fourhourworkweek com naval  and you can listen to both of these episodes on the product hunt page also  so, fourhourworkweek com naval  please, if you re enjoying these podcasts, they take a lot of time and energy to put together, so go to one or both of those and upvote them if you enjoyed them  fourhourweek com fox and fourhourworkweek com naval  okay, here we go  this is a list, and some of these are just quotes, little tiny tidbits, tips, but you can certainly dig into all of these episodes for more  and every episode can be found at fourhourworkweek com podcast  enough urls  here we go  matt mullenweg is thought of as the developer   or lead developer   of wordpress  an incredible entrepreneur who runs a startup now worth more than a billion dollars, automatic  he gave me some great advice that has greatly assisted my writing, and that is listening to one music track, a single track, on repeat  and that effectively serves as an external mantra along the lines of transcendental meditation that allows you to focus on other things  in this case, writing  he uses it for coding, and, in terms of tracks, i have used music ranging from pendulum to gramatik  usually, i use electronica  matt uses, in some cases, jazz, hip hop, or electronica  next, we have dominic d agostino, a scientist and researcher based in florida who does a lot of work with ketones among other things  i picked up from him, breakfast of canned sardines and oysters  and that sounds disgusting, and it s actually delicious, i look forward to this every morning  and, specifically, i buy wild planet  i m looking over my shoulder at two boxes of 12 sardines each that i brought on vacation with me, and you can buy these on amazon  so it s wild planet wild sardines packed in olive oil  and since i m traveling with my pooch and she doesn t like dry kibble very much, what i ll do is, i ll eat the sardines and then i ll pour out some of the sardine soaked olive oil on top of her kibbble and then she eats it like a crackhead, which is great  so, helps everybody  so, breakfast of sardines, then using synthetic ketones for aerobic performance among other things  the ketocana which, i believe, was developed by patrick arnold   which will hopefully be an upcoming podcast   that is fantastic, also, for use in fasting   that s another thing i learned from dominic  to make the transition from carb dependent to ketone fueled, this copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    can be very, very helpful  just a couple of tablespoons of these synthetic ketones to make that jump without turning into a total whiny bitch is great   and getting yourself in trouble by emailing people and creating messes, which i ve done before while fasting  and last is the keto ice cream recommendation from dom  and, of course, i ve learned a lot more from all these people than just these things  but the keto ice cream, this is a fat bomb  it s about 100 grams of fat, and for those who don t want to do the math, it s about 900 calories, and it s delicious  okay, so keto ice cream is one to two cups of sour cream or coconut cream  i used strauss creamery sour cream which is incredible  it s actually not sour, it kind of tastes like ice cream anyway  then one tablespoon of dark chocolate baking coco  some salt, just like a two or three finger pinch of salt  a little bit of stevia  dom buys it in bulk  cinnamon, and then one tablespoon of coconut oil drizzled in, so you would just heat that up and then drizzle that over  and sometimes he ll put 1 3 to   cup wild blueberries  and then heavy cream on top of that is whipped cream, effectively  so that is the recipe, a lot of you have asked me for it  it appears in the original audio around 12 minutes and 22 seconds, but i m sure it s later in the finished product  okay, next up, jocko willink, the most decorated special operations commander across all the special ops divisions in the iraq conflict  jocko willink, quote   discipline is freedom   this is a guy who wakes up between 4 00 and 4 30 every morning and one of his tweets   i think it s just  on twitter   one of his more recent tweets was,  looking for your soul? it s at the bottom of the squat rack   and it s a picture of his squat rack with sweat all over the floor at about 4 45 in the morning  so, discipline is freedom  i interpret this to mean, among other things, that you can use positive constrains like, say, workouts with other people at the beginning and the end of your days   bookmarks   to allow you more effectively to use that as scaffolding or fore scheduling other things in your life  so, positive constraints  how could you use positive constraints to create discipline which then gives you freedom where it counts most   say, in your creative activities? next, dr  dan engle  so, i interviewed martin polanco and dan engle on ibogaine, micro dosing, and uses of ayahuasca and other psychedelics in addictive populations and in many other places  so, what i picked up and experimented with after that conversation was two fold  no  1) flotation tanks and specifically doing two hour sessions at least twice per week  and there does seem to be some type of phase shift or binary change when you get to two hours  i can t explain it, i don t know why, maybe it s psychosomatic  but two hours is worth more than two one hour sessions, in other words  there s some type of change that you undergo   cognitively, emotionally, psychologically   that i can t explain that seems to be very significant  and after doing, copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    say, two floats   monday, friday   for two weeks, i feel like i normally would after, say, a month of meditating daily  so, seems to have a tremendous impact on just mental stability and zen like calmness that is nonetheless effective  so go figure  second is something i won t elaborate on too much here because i can t get into it, but, hypothetically, i might have a friend who may have experimented with micro dosing non psychedelic quantities of ibogaine hydrochloride  specifically, about 1 400th of a full psychedelic ride which i m not interested in  the heroic dose equivalent of ibogaine is too terrifying even for me and unnecessary, i think, at this point in time  micro dosing once every four days or so for anxiolytic, that s anxiety reducing effects  more to report there, hopefully, soon  the jury s still out  next, wim hoff, the iceman, the crazy dutchman himself  breath works  so we re doing some of his strong inhale, sort of moderate exhale breathing techniques for a few minutes every morning  say, 30 breaths   and you can listen to the podcast for some detail on this   has effectively replaced the need for caffeine in the morning, so that s been spectacular  and then, he has reinvigorated my interest in extended ice baths  typically five to 15 minutes for me  what i ll do is, i ll get about 20 pounds of ice, put it into a bathtub   and i do these typically in the evening   and i will read a book for about five to ten minutes  obviously, i m not a doctor, i don t play one on the internet  so if you start feeling extremely uncomfortable, get the fuck out of the tub  don t go into hypothermia or something stupid like that  but i ll do five to 10 minutes with the ice and water up to just below the nipples, and i will read, and then i will slink down for the last three to five minutes, and   important here   i will leave my hands out of the water and head out of the water  so it s basically immersing my torso and folding my legs to fit, and i ll do that for the last three to five minutes  and sometimes go back and forth, hot cold, hot cold, like contrast therapy as the east germans were very famous for using back in the day  cautionary note on wim hoff  a very close friend of mine almost died last week  he had a shallow water blackout because he was practicing cycles of the wim hoff breathing and then doing breath holds while swimming underwater  do not ever practice this technique in water  he had a shallow water blackout, remained blacked out, unconscious, underwater for an additional two to three minutes, was yanked out by a lifeguard, remained unconscious then for an additional 20 minutes, and had to undergo hospitalization for three days and a barrage of tests for a long time   meaning about a week   until he just got cleared  could have died extremely easily  so, do not practice this type of breath work in combination with water immersion, it is asking for trouble  next, robert rodriguez, famed director and film maker  really, his description of journaling got me to take my own journaling to the next level where many of you know i use the five minute journal in the morning and then as a check in at night  but also, i m copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    doing more morning pages  and if you want to see what a journal entry of mine looks like, you can just search  what my morning journal looks like , or  morning journal  and  ferriss , and it should pop right up on google  and there s also a quote from robert rodriguez, and i believe he got this from francis ford coppola, and that is,  failure is not durable   and, i think, also from francis ford coppola in the video series from robert rodriguez where he interviews these famous directors like francis ford coppola, tarantino, etc    it s called the director s chair, it s spectacular   one of the other quotes, i believe, from the francis ford coppola episode was,  the things that will get you fired when you re starting out are the things they give lifetime achievement awards for later   and i thought that was fantastic to keep in mind as you experiment and get chastised in your life  next, tara brach  famous meditation teacher, buddhist, dharma talk giver   her talks are fantastic  and the lesson that i ve learned among others from her is  invite mara to tea  and this just means it has to do with recognizing anger and other types of what we might call negative emotions, and rather than trying to suppress them, effectively saying,  i see you   and if you re meditating, for instance, you might just repeat, if you re angry,  anger, anger,  so you acknowledge that, and then that allows you to go back to whatever the focus in the meditation is  in my case, it s a mantra, like transcendental meditation which we ll get to in a second  and if you re looking for a book to read to contend with emotions like anger, for instance, among others, check out radical acceptance  i don t like the title very much, but it makes a lot of sense once you get into it  i read this book for just five to ten minutes each night in the tub   see how these tie together?   and it had a huge impact on me  so tara brach  radical acceptance is the book  next is rick rubin, legendary music producer, and chase jarvis, world famous photographer  both of them introduced me to transcendental meditation   or finally got me to bite the bullet  there are things i dislike about how tm is taught, generally, such as the price you have to pay   1,000 00 to  1500 00 to be given a mantra and then have a week or so of once daily lessons  which are very pragmatic and tactical, and the teacher, in this case, holds you accountable, which was very important to me  and i remember i bitched and moaned about price  i bitched and moaned about the sort of guru worship that is involved for five minutes one of the first days that i disliked  but they both effectively said,  what do you have to lose?  and  you can afford it  you obviously need it,    for reasons i could get into another time  and they convinced me to do that and it had a huge impact  now, this was actually, probably, preceding this year, but since the rick rubin episode came out in 2015, i wanted to reiterate and thank, again, both of these gentlemen for introducing me to transcendental meditation  tm org   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    if you want to know about other forms of meditation, vipassana and otherwise, i encourage you to listen to my sam harris podcast episode  1  he also gets into it in his second episode  next  laird hamilton, the best big wave surfer of all time, according to most folks out there  and then, his wife gabriel reece who is a spectacular athlete and human being in her own right  so laird introduced me to the chaga mushroom   which is an incredible super food of sorts   as well as the book natural born heroes  and he was, of course, one of my surf teachers for the tim ferris experiment which you can find on itunes com timferriss if you want to see that entire season of television that i did with the folks behind anthony bordain s shows  that was a lot of fun  and then from gabby, the principle of going first  don t wait for other people to smile at you  don t wait for other people to say hello  practice going first, being proactive in improving other peoples  states  in those tiny, daily interactions that   guess what?   are the big things  the little things are the big things, cumulatively  so that concept of gong first is something that i really appreciated from gabby and have implemented in my own life  next from stanley mcchrystal   four star, i believe   four star general  and also from wim hoff, skipping breakfast  i ve been experimenting with skipping breakfast and, in some cases, skipping breakfast is not entirely skipping food 100 percent in the morning, but perhaps having what i might nickname titanium tea  you can google that to find more on it, but it s pu erh tea, plus ginger and turmeric, plus some coconut oil  and the coconut oil gives you about 60 to 70 percent by weight medium chain triglycerides which are converted to ketones very easily, and it just keeps you less grumpy in the morning until you get to, say, lunch  all right, next  bryan johnson, founder of braintree, an incredible entrepreneur, sold it for  800 million   cash, i believe   to ebay, and is just a philosopher king of sorts  the question that he posed to me when he s thinking of resolutions, goals, is what could you do that would be remembered in two to 400 years   meaning 200 to 400 years  and when you re thinking of your own resolutions for the next year, or in general, i think this is a good question to pose, even if you feel that it s impossible as a thought exercise  what could you do that would be remembered in 200 to 400 years? next, rhonda patrick, scientist, phd  she and i have spoken about many things including using heat treatment to trigger heat shock proteins and increases in growth hormone, etc  so, we ve talked a lot about cold, but how might i use a sauna or steam room to improve athletic performance, endurance, etc ? there s a blog post that she wrote on my blog for that  so if you search  rhonda patrick , just go to fourhourblog com, all spelled out, and search for  rhonda patrick  and  sauna , and it ll pop right up  next, sammy kamkar, the computer hacker who was banned from touching computers by the fbi for two years or so  a good buddy of mine  we spoke about all sorts of hacking, how he takes toys from, say, mattel and rejigs them to be able to open locked copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    cars  all sorts of fun stuff, how he created software for his drone that would effectively pirate other drones so he could create swarms that he can control  but we also talked about hacking dating, and tinder, and, at the very simplest level, how to determine what your best profile photos are  you can use a feature on okcupid called my best face that can figure that out in a span of hours or, at the very most, days  and we talked at length about that, also, in the dating   i guess it was just the dating game episode of the tim ferris experiment  if you want to see me, also, do some work with neil strauss of the game and embarrass myself horribly, horribly, doing cold approaches at the ferry building in san francisco where i look like a total ass, then i encourage you to check out the dating game episode of the tim ferris experiment on itunes  it will make you laugh and make me cry  next, derek sivers, the founder of cd baby, one of my favorite humans  there are many things i ve learned from derek  viewing your decisions or opportunities that come to you or that you find in terms of  hell yeah  or  no    meaning, anything that isn t  hell yeah  is a  no   if you re like,  that could be kind of cool  oh, yeah, that might be cool,  that s a  no   it has to be a  hell yeah  or  fuck yes , an enthusiastic  yes  to make it through your filters and get a commitment  next is, if you say you re busy, that means you re out of control  so if you find yourself responding to  how are you?  with  busy, man  yeah, i m busy,  that means your life is out of control  it means you don t have systems in place  it means you re making sloppy decisions  that is a fantastic sanity check  all right, next, we have   my dog keeps on flinching when i say,  next   sorry, molly  all right  alex blumberg  alex blumberg has been killing it  gimlet media has been killing it with the mystery show, with startup podcast, reply all  they ve been just slaying it and doing extremely, extremely well with the podcast game on itunes and elsewhere  and i did two episodes with alex on how to create a blockbuster podcast, and i wanted to focus on a couple of questions that he is very good at asking  how do you elicit what he would call authentic moments of emotion? he s worked with ira glass on this american life, planet money, etc  authentic moments of emotion  so, feelings humor, etc  but how do you pull those out? how do you make them memorable? well, you have to look first for a sequence of actions that culminate in something  so let s make that concrete, and the wording is super important here  and i m going to be doing a bunch of blogposts on my podcast methods, what i ve learned, etc  about every facet of podcast creation, production, promotion  but the wording is critical in the questions that you ask  so, for instance  tell me about a time when, dot, dot, dot  and you ll notice these are intended to produce stories, not just short abstract answers  so tell me about a time when, dot, dot, dot  tell me about the day or moment or time when okay? copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    next  this is perhaps my favorite  tell me the story of  tell me the story of how you met so and so  tell me the story of how you ended up majoring in whatever, whatever  next  describe the conversation when  and then you ll notice i did this, for instance, in a number of podcasts with people who are, say, discussing leaving a job to start a company, and they have to have that conversation with their spouse  describe the conversation when you first mentioned to your wife or husband that you wanted to drop this lucrative career in x and start your own company  that will get you a good story  next  what were the steps that got you to   blank? all right? what were the steps that got you to   blank? those are a couple of good examples, and if you want to skip specifically to this type of tactical stuff, you can listen to the part two with alex blumberg that you can find at fourhourworkweek com podcast  all right  next up is marc goodman  marc goodman used to be a futurist for the fbi  simple recommendation  put some electrical tape or something like that on the inside of hotel room peepholes  it is remarkably easy for someone to attach a camera that will record what is happening inside your hotel room  this happened to a female tv broadcaster at one point  she was recorded changing her clothing, getting naked, because a fan stalker weirdo, who happened to be tech savvy, slapped one of these cameras on to the front of her hotel room  so, easy way to fix that, put some tape on it  and i would recommend doing that on your laptop as well after sammy kamkar indicated how easy it was for him to hijack my computer  and i m sure many of you do embarrassing things in front of your computer   or potentially embarrassing things   so get a cover for your camera on the laptop as well while you are at it  next up, tony robbins  tony robbins has been an influence for a very long time, but i ve only come to know him, personally, in the last year or two  and i m paraphrasing here, but i did go to my first live event ever, which was unleash the power within, and the most valuable exercise for me was something called the dickens process  and i ll back into that in just a second  but the lesson is, you can t just look at the rewards of action when you re evaluating what to do, you have to look at the costs of inaction  and the dickens process   which you can google and, i m sure, find information on   refers to scrooge and the night before christmas  so, he is visited by the ghosts of christmas past, present, and future  in the dickens process, you re taken through a procedure whereby you look at limiting behaviors   say, you re top two or three limiting or handicapping beliefs and behaviors   let s just focus on beliefs   and what those have cost you in the past, and what those have cost people you ve loved in the past  what those are costing you and people you care about in the present  and then, what it will cost you and people you care about, say, a year from now, three years from now, five, ten years from now, etc   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    and it is a very powerful approach for modifying behavior  so you can t just look at the rewards of action, you have to look at the costs of inaction or persisting with limiting beliefs and behaviors  next  neil strauss, my buddy, seven time   probably eight time new york times bestselling author now  also, a fantastic interviewer  he s done interviews for the new york times, rolling stone, and so on  and he advised in my podcast with him   we talked about a lot, and we covered interviewing   he said, you should open up and be vulnerable to the person you re going to be interviewing before you start the interview  so, whenever possible, if i m doing an in person interview   or phone interview, for that matter   i ll take five to ten minutes to kind of banter, get them warmed up, and to also volunteer some type of sensitive or vulnerable information about myself so that they are inclined to do the same later  and it works incredibly well  so, neil, thank you for that  next  kelly starret, the supple leopard, one of the most famous pts and athletic trainers in the country  kelly starret introduced me to   i believe it was kelly   who introduced me to the chilipad  and rick rubin uses one of these as well  so chilipad allows you, even if you are a couple and in bed   and let s just describe a common problem  all right  so, women are like floor heaters for some reason  if a man and a woman, sleeping in a bed under the same set of sheets, the woman s going to run at 700 degrees  the guys going to get sweaty and hot, and he s going to kick one leg over on top of the sheets, then get cold, then put the leg underneath, and it s a huge pain in the ass for everybody  or he s going to yank the covers off, make the woman upset  it s just too highly individualized  the chilipad allows you to put this extremely thin   almost imperceptibly thin   sheet underneath your side of the bed, and it circulates water through with this bedside contraption at a very precise temperature  so it could be 51 degrees  maybe that s your magic sleeping temperature  55 degrees  if you re cold, you can increase the temperature of that chilipad underneath you instead of throwing on a really thick blanket that s going to make your partner sweat to death  so, the chilipad, it s not inexpensive, but you can find it on their site or on amazon  one of my friends told me about three months ago, of all of the advice that he has ever received from my books and podcasts, this had the biggest impact on his quality of life  so kelly, thank you, the chilipad  next  jon favreau, incredible director, thinker, actor, writer  here s the quote   in terms of comedy, don t aim for funny, aim for truth   and i think that when you parody very serious subjects, if you aim for truth   the sort of kernel of honesty that everyone is thinking and hasn t said  or that everyone has seen, but not described   don t aim for funny, aim for truth   copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    okay, next up, naval ravikant  i mentioned this episode was nominated for best podcast of the year by product hunt, so please upvote it, fourhourworkweek com naval  he recommended a book called sapiens which has just been on fire in silicon valley  many, many people recommending this  so, sapiens  i have read the first, i would say, 15 percent, and, as promised, more highlights in this book, probably, than i ve put down in any other non fiction book in recent memory  it is a spectacular synopsis of many complex and potentially complicated subjects, but it s made easy to read  and it is about how the homo sapiens effectively took over the world  and there s a lot more to it than that, but check it out  all right  next, we have jamie foxx  let s talk about jamie foxx, the most consummate entertainer i ve ever met in my life  i ve got a quote and then a recommendation  so the first is the quote   what is on the other side of fear? nothing   so, looking at whatever you re afraid of and asking,  what is on the other side of this fear if i push though it?  and the answer is, generally, nothing  there s no negative consequence  there is no persistence  and to come back to the francis ford coppola and robert rodriguez point, failure is not durable  all right? so, what is on the other side of fear? nothing  and that is something he s taught his kids and instilled in them  and then, next is pull ups, the pull up bar, at the very least, being the basis for maintaining a ripped physique with a minimal effective dose with very little effort  that is something that he does every morning  you can listen to his entire workout routine by listening to the full podcast  and, hate to plug it again, but i m gonna do it one more time, guys  this is nominated, this episode, the jamie foxx episode as best podcast of the year, and i really implore you to listen to it if you haven t  he is just a complete rock star, knocks it out of the park  upvote that  take five seconds, fourhourworkweek com foxx, and upvote it  and for pull ups, if you want something to try that s a little tricky and that you could use   this is courtesy of a trainer named max shank, an incredible trainer   ice cream makers  look up a move called the ice cream maker, and try that on a pull up bar  it is a great move to help with progressions toward a front lover  okay  and then we have, as the grand finale, b  j  novak  and b  j  novak, i think, in december, this is particularly relevant as you re doing a retrospective looking at the last 12 months, coming up on the holidays, christmas, etc , and new year s, of course  more important, i think, than setting resolutions for the year ahead  although that s very important   is doing a retrospective, a post game analysis on the last year  what did you do right? what did you do wrong? what could have made it better? etc  really doing that type of assessment  and b  j  mentioned, at one point, looking back at his career, how he could ve stalled in a number of places, and he ended up, of course, becoming very well known for the office and many other things  but if you find yourself saying to yourself,  but i m making so much money  about a job or project or something that you re working on, that is a warning sign that you should pay attention to   but i m making so much money  or  but copyright   2007 2018 tim ferriss  all rights reserved    i m making good money   if you find yourself saying that but dot dot dot money justification, that is a warning sign that you re probably not in the right place, or at least that you shouldn t stay where you are if that is coming to mind  because, of course, time itself is the most valuable, non renewable resource  and money can always be made back  money can always be made later  you can have a balloon payment to yourself with successes later, but, so far, we haven t figured out how to do that with time  so those are some of the lessons that i have learned from guests in 2015  there are many, many, many, many more  in fact, i m hiring someone to put together highly enhanced, condensed synopses of all of my podcast episodes, so hopefully those will be available some point in the near future, but it could take a few months  and i just want to take this opportunity to express my sincerest gratitude and thanks to all of you for listening to the podcast  it is really   it s been a blast for me to do  and it s not just been a blast for me to do because i get to interview all these incredible people  it s been a blast, first and foremost, because i get so much feedback  i get questions from you that make me better  you point things out that i didn t even notice in the process of interviewing these people  and i appreciate you helping me to get better  i appreciate you listening to the work that i m working very hard to put out  it takes a lot of time and a lot of energy  i m happy to do it because it has been a labor of love and, honestly, it s the only creative project, thus far, where i ve had 100 percent creative control  and i must tell you, it is fucking worth it, because i ve had a good experience with my publishers, i ve had a very tough experience with tv, but at the end of the day, i can t do anything that i want with my books, for instance, because i do not own all of the rights  and with the podcast, i can do whatever the fuck i want  so if you have any crazy ass ideas for what i should do with the podcast, anything i could do to stir the pot, any crazy pranks or experiments that i should do, please let me know on twitter,  or on facebook, facebook com timferriss  and, as always, and i do mean this guys, thank you so much for listening, and happy holidays   copyright   2007 2018 tim

173,181,How to ‘Waste Money’ to Improve the Quality of Your Life (#181),"'i was asked recently how i choose my projects and what i say yes to, what i say no to  i riffed on this and we recorded it as part of something larger that i ll be sharing in the near future  i realized that the real question is, at the root of a lot of my decisions, how can i waste money to improve my quality of life? and this seems like a bad thing, but it is not  it is trading pennies for dollars ''so how can you waste money to improve the quality of your life? well, i will delve into all of that and much more  this was spontaneous  it s off the cuff, so it is not a ted talk, but i hope you will get a lot out of it  i was encouraged to share it because people there at the time felt like folks might like it  so please enjoy how to waste money to improve quality of life ''how do i determine what to delegate versus what to do on my own? ''this is an ongoing challenge, as it is for a lot of people, but a few of the things that i consider are  first and foremost, do i understand the task and the roles and the actions, to do lists, checklists involved? this is going to sound funny and i don t think this is necessarily the best approach for everyone, but for me as a type a perfectionist, i like to have a base level of competency in almost anything that i delegate ''i say almost anything because i m not a coder, for instance, so i don t need to know how to work with css or anything else to work with a designer, but i do know how to sketch and create mock ups or wire frames  so i can work with those abstraction layers and then the levels below it   the sort of implementation of that, i don t need to understand as well  but in case of, for instance, podcast editing, i went into a very imperfect tool   garageband, in this case   and edited the first probably 20 or 30 episodes, because i enjoyed learning that, as i enjoy learning new skills  but ultimately once i understood how to refine the process, then i delegate it ''so to frame that another way, i think it was bill gates who said, and i m paraphrasing, but this was in the 4 hour workweek, that when you add people to an inefficient process, you make things worse  only when you add people to an efficient process do you make things better  and there s a book called the mythical man month on software design and software development that talks about this  where if you have a late software project because the underlying process has been fucked, if you add more developers to it, you re just going to make things worse  it s just going to take longer  so i like to test drive almost every process myself first, before i delegate it ''i think that most problems with delegation, most things that get missed, most mistakes that get made are the boss s fault, not the employee s fault or the contractor s fault  it s because the task itself wasn t clear enough in the beginning  a lot of people delegate because they don t want to do the hard thinking  you have to do the hard thinking  you should delegate because you can give hard work to someone else or time consuming work  so that s no  1  i like to have a base level of competency of all these things ''then how do i choose what to delegate? ''i will look at my highest yield activities  the way i ll determine that is i will look at, for instance, my to do list, which is really a list of tasks or next actions of some type  i will ask myself, which one of these if done will make all of the rest easier to do or irrelevant?''because i m looking for   and i ve used this analogy before   the lead domino  i m looking for the first domino  i don t want to knock down 7,000 different dominoes that are downstream and have to repeat that process  i want to find the one archimedes lever that, when used effectively, makes everything else either easier to do or irrelevant  that is what i will focus on, generally speaking  when in doubt, the thing that you ve been avoiding the longest is the thing that you should at least do the hard thinking on first ''so what is important? how do i know what my most important task is to do? before i check email in the two hours that i ve blocked out for that type of deep work, whatever it is that makes you most uncomfortable  but i will look at this list and very often, my highest yield activity will be related to one of my more unique abilities  i m not saying it s unique  singular to me   for instance, part of the reason that i took   and this is not delegation, this is elimination, so we re getting very 4 hour workweek here, but you have definition, elimination, automation, liberation ''okay, so before i liberate myself by delegating, i want to remove as much as possible  so at one point about a year ago now, i realized that i was replaceable as an investor in the startup ecosystem  economics were such that given deal structures and absurd things that were happening and an oversupply of capital, if i was approached by an entrepreneur who is just price shopping for valuation, for instance, and i said no, i would just head out of the line and there d be 20 behind me to take the deal ''one of my friends said,  please don t stop writing   he said to me,  you are replaceable as an investor, but i ve seen you at conferences where people come up to you and they re crying because they lost 100 pounds and it changed their life or saved their marriage or whatever it might be  you re not going to have that impact  you re not going to see that impact, at least, as an investor   therefore, i try to focus on my unique or more unique abilities as much as possible  things that i don t think i can delegate ''ideally, i have a venn diagram of the things that i am uniquely capable of doing well, or somewhat uniquely capable of doing well, the things that i enjoy doing (that s the second circle), and then the things that give me a high yield  and that could be a yield of capital financially speaking  it could give me a high yield of time ''for instance, if i invest ten hours now in creating a system making decisions about x, for instance, not to do startup investing at all, which is what i decided, because i don t do moderation well  you can search  startup vacation  and  tim ferriss  for a long description of how i did this  i sat down, i did journaling, and came to the conclusion by looking at worst case scenarios   what is the worst that could happen if   how could i get back to this point if i wanted to reverse it, etc ? i decided to do no startup investing  so i did the hard thinking that eliminated a thousand smaller decisions moving forward ''now i just archive any cold pitch that i get  any cold intro that i get from, say a venture capitalist to an entrepreneur gets an auto responder that says,  i am not doing startup investing  here is the article if you want to read it   that is, i think, where people should focus before delegating is eliminating as much as possible ''other things that i think about would be largely questions that i ask  so one of the temptations as an entrepreneur is to look at a task you delegate and say to yourself this is a fallacy  the internal dialogue will be something along the lines of  i could delegate this but it s going to take me just as long to describe it as it will to just do it myself  so i ll just do it myself ''and here s the miscalculation  the assumption is time is the currency that you are protecting in this case  so time is the most valuable currency  i would say that time, as much as i talk about it, is only valuable to the extent that you have attention and present state awareness ''so for instance, if i have a three hour block set aside for deep work on writing  and there s a great essay, i think it s called  maker s schedule, manager s schedule  by paul graham  a fantastic read  everyone should read it  but in effect, for me to write really effectively (and this is true for a lot of coders also, and musicians, if they re composing), i need a lot of time set aside  because there s a very long warm up process and to synthesize takes space mentally and otherwise ''yes, i could have time in the middle of that to handle sending, for instance, wire instructions to my bank to get something done instead of having my assistant do it  it might be faster for me to do it  i could do it in 30 seconds  it s going to take me this much time to do blah, blah, blah  but the question is, can i afford the distraction? even if i have to upset someone, postpone it, talk to them the next day, get it done, pay a late fee, whatever it might be  the question isn t do i have the time ''it s also, can i afford the distraction? because if in the middle of that three hours i get a text from my assistant like, i really need help doing this  can you please do y? or whatever it might be  i don t why i start with y instead of x  just to throw you off  and if i address that   ideally i don t even see the text, which is why i put my phone on airplane   but let s just say i see it  if i address that and i take five to ten minutes to do it, the three hour clock starts over  so maybe i get only 20 minutes of real good writing in that period, as opposed to an hour and a half  was that worth the interruption, even though i saved five minutes in the implementation? no  it was a complete loss  it was a total faustian bargain ''so the book that i would recommend and i ve said this before to at least a handful of people, my favorite book on productivity is called the effective executive  a terribly bland title by peter drucker, the effective executive  the 4 hour workweek, i m just sort of assuming that people listening to this have probably already read that  but the effective executive is fantastic because it focuses on being effective   doing the right things, not just doing things well   being efficient ''because you can be really good at doing things that don t matter  the effectiveness part   so in a way, i m not dodging the question, but i think that the vast majority of people i talk to when they say, oh my god, i m overwhelmed by x, y and z  i need to hire people a, b and c to handle it  those tasks largely shouldn t be done in the first place ''when i drill down and we have two glasses of wine and talk about their systems and so on, they haven t done the deep dive to really determine the relative value of all of these things  they re just feeling temporarily overwhelmed and they just want to hit the volleyball back over the net and not think about it for a while  so that would be where i would start ''the last piece i ll throw out there, and i know this is a meandering answer, is that i ve been asking myself more and more, how can i waste money (in air quotes), how can i waste money to improve my quality of life? and pick a crazy number  ''so if you currently spend   and this is not prudent to do if you are just scraping by and paying for your rent  this is not a place for what i m going to suggest  but let s just say you ve hit a level up in your career and you have a little bit of disposal income  your behaviors may be tethered to a very frugal lifestyle that you once had, where your money was a scarcer resource that your time ''so for me, i came out of college, my family never made much money, very, very frugal by necessity  then i get to college, worked as a bouncer  i worked in the library and then i figured out some other options that made a bit more money  illustration, etc  graduate, i m making  40,000 00 or so a year in silicon valley at the peak of  99  prices are insane  and i found myself, even a few years ago, realizing, for instance, that i was blowing hundreds of thousands of dollars of opportunity by flying economy internationally when i needed to sleep ''so this might sound funny, but i ve had the budget to buy business class tickets for a very long time now, but it wasn t until about five years ago, after i went to a speaking engagement in australia  i flew economy because i was like what? i m not going to spend an extra  2,000 00 on a business class ticket  i couldn t sleep at all and was just a complete disaster for a speaking engagement that could ve easily led to many, many future engagements  i did a good job of that  it required a ton of caffeine  it required all nighters and my health suffered for about a week ''so it s like okay, was the  2,000 00 worth sacrificing my health for a week and being at half capacity? no, easily not  at all  the value of my time being at 10 out of 10 is far more valuable  second, was it worth the potential opportunity cost of the people in the audience who could ve hired me for very high paying gigs? no  not at all ''so i ve modified my older behaviors that were survival behaviors to be more abundance mindset behaviors  i can always make more money  i can t create more time  at this point, i can t necessarily fix my health if i ruin it ''so the question that i ask now is okay, my old self would view buying a business class ticket as a waste of money  what other ways can i  waste  money to improve my quality of life? maybe that s hiring someone to clean  maybe that s taking uber instead of having a car to deal with for maintenance and insurance and parking and parking tickets and all of that bullshit  maybe it s who knows? fill in the blank ''so i will do journaling exercises where i ll write down, okay pick a number  let s just say   i m making this up   you have  5,000 00 of disposable income per month, all right? i m putting aside how much you need to save for whatever you want to save for  so if you have college tuition to save for and so on, you need to do those calculations on your own ''but let s just say you have  5,000 00 you can do whatever you want with and you re currently only spending  500 00  you have all these things that are driving you crazy  well, let s say i wanted to go crazy and spend  2,000 00 per month  you want to  waste  (so called waste)  2,000 00 a month to improve your quality of life  what would that look like? what are some crazy things that you could do?''just journal  start making a list  start writing it out  don t edit  it s incredible what you will come up with  you can then test it on a trial basis for a week or two  that is how i ve identified some of the smallest changes with the largest quality of life outputs imaginable by doing this very simple exercise  i hate to give so many caveats, but this does not mean that you take your whole life savings and blow it on whisky and whores, okay? just so we re clear  that s not what i m recommending ''it does mean, however, that you don t, when you ve reached a certain level in maslow s hierarchy of needs, that you don t make decisions based on a survival mindset that has traveled with you from the sort of shelter food basis, if that makes sense  it s taken me a long time to realize that  this type of questioning and these types of journaling exercises and overall a focus on effectiveness and not efficiency, i think, are the drivers behind   long story long   how i decide what to do myself or what to delegate '"
193,201,"Meditation, Mindset, and Mastery (#201)","'this particular episode, i m going to try to do one better  i m excited to bring you a little sample taste test of a new show format that i m working on  and this isn t going to displace the other   it s just to complement it  and i m calling it, for lack of a better name, for the time being,  the tim ferriss radio hour,  and you ll see where this is going  and, after nearly 200 hours of conversations with world class performers all over the map, including people like arnold schwarzenegger, jamie foxx, tony robbins, maria popova, peter thiel, marc andreessen, amanda palmer, malcolm gladwell, rick rubin, reid hoffman, and so many more, you start to spot patterns or at least, when i m reviewing all of the transcripts, i spot patterns  sometimes they re months apart but these are the shared habits, philosophies, tools, and more that are the common thread or the common threat ''and this is the premise, of course, of my new book, tools of titans, which is a compilation of all of my favorite patterns, all of my favorite routines   you can check that out everywhere   but that s also where  the tim ferriss radio hour  comes in  in each episode, we ll take a deep dive into one specific topic or tactic, bringing together the collective genius of past guests to help you, hopefully, become world class in your own right if you aren t already  at the very least, it will give you a common thread, as i mentioned, with slight tweaks here and there that you can customize, in effect, to your idiosyncrasies   to your own personality   or you can blend them together  and, today, in this sneak peek episode, we will be exploring meditation  meditation, or practicing mindfulness, is by far the most common pattern across them all  in this episode, for instance, i ask chase jarvis to explain his top priorities for feeling fulfilled ''chase jarvis  i ve found sort of a new passion for sleep  i can t ever   not never   but i rarely get the eight, nine, ten    i talk tm   that s transcendental meditation   with the terminator, the governator, arnold schwarzenegger ''arnold schwarzenegger  i would say within 14 days, 3 weeks, i got to the point where i could really disconnect my mind and also learn how to focus more and to calm down  i cover a wide spectrum with sam harris and talk about everything   or ask him about everything from hallucinogens to meditation techniques ''sam harris  the unique power of psychedelics is that they are guaranteed to work in some way  and then i wrap up with rainn wilson discussing how to handle life when you feel overwhelmed   and we all end up, at points, feeling overwhelmed or, at the very least, unclear ''rainn wilson  it was the key for me as an actor that kind of broke me open and got me out of my head and just got me in my body and in that place of kind of pure imagination and spontaneity that you really want as an actor  we start our deep dive on meditation with chase jarvis, ceo of creativelive which is an online learning platform that broadcasts live, of course, high definition classes to more than 10 million students in 200 plus countries  chase was also the youngest person ever to be named a hasselblad master, nikon master, and asmp master  he has photographed for nike, apple, columbia sportswear, rei, honda, subaru, polaroid, lady gaga, red bull, and many more  he s one of the most successful commercial photographers on the planet  so, without further ado, let s jump into the first episode of  the tim ferriss radio hour   enjoy '' intro music  what do you feel have become your top priorities in feeling happy or fulfilled? what are the things, as you become wiser, that you ve learned to prize more or prize less?''chase jarvis  health  hmm  yeah ''chase jarvis  one s health and being active is incredibly valuable  and i feel like and old person saying this next one but sleep  i have lived on four to six hours of sleep for the last ten years so just prioritizing sleep  and the third one is meditation  meditation is  '' crosstalk  oh, yeah  we haven t talked about this in a while  aha ''chase jarvis  you were on it for a good bit and you said you felt  '' crosstalk  i was  i fell off the wagon but, yeah, you were one of two people that i credit with finally kicking me in the ass to take it seriously ''chase jarvis  it has really been a good thing  '' crosstalk  yeah, specifically tm? so transcendental meditation for those who don t know   or trademark ''chase jarvis  yeah  but i have my issues with almost every form of meditation  there are pros and cons   we ve talked about them before   but tell me about your meditation practice ''chase jarvis  my meditation practice is not perfect and none are  i just sit down between 15 and 20 minutes twice a day  sometimes, i only get one time a day, sometimes, those are a little compressed or shit happens   you re on an airplane and the captain comes on and pulls you out of it   or whatever ''but i make a conscious effort to just observe my thoughts and practice tm in the morning and the evening before dinner and it has made   the analogy that i can most simply put here on your show is it s when you re in the zone   say, playing sports or playing music   and things just seem effortless  it s called a  flow state   steven kotler s new book   which is a good book, the rise of superman, check that out, a little plug for his book about creativity and flow states   but that sense of flow, it s when things sort of happen in slow motion  now, you re not literally talking in slow motion but you have the same clarity as if you re going through life and everything s happening in slow motion  instead of that,  i m hyper caffeinated, my boss is   '' crosstalk   i m agitated and reactive   dodging bullets '' crosstalk ''chase jarvis  yeah   ahhhh   instead, you re just like,  i m driving the bus here and we re going to go here, and then i m going to do this  ''and there s this certain clarity it s like magic  it s really weird  and there s one other thing   i don t know if you ve felt this, tim, but it sort of aggregates so you get a good benefit from one, two, three, four, then when you re on a roll, there s this sort of exponential   there s a sort of overdrive   and it s like,  oh my gosh, i feel like i m just floating   yeah  i can t explain it, either but, for me   and just for those people who might be thinking like i did for my entire life  ''chase jarvis   bullshit   yeah,  bullshit   no,  i don t want people  ohm ing  me in fricking all this    yeah, yeah, yeah  chakra, whatever  i m not into it  especially living in san francisco, i ve developed an allergy to sanctimonious   and i ve been to burning man   but sanctimonious burner types who want to lecture me about chakras  i m just like,  honestly, please, i can t handle another minute of this   so i ve had this aversion to meditation but, when it s very sort of non dogmatic   where it s like, look, you re not trying to control anything, you re not trying to think of a candle flame   just observe your thoughts and be okay with them and sit with good posture for a period of time, that s it ''even if you think it s a shitty job and you re running through your to do list or thinking of the stock market, that s okay  just make it part of your routine  and what i found was   and some well known people who do tm are like paul mccartney or ariana huffington  ''chase jarvis  david lynch  david lynch  i m blanking on his name for some reason but bridgewater capital   largest hedge fund in, if not the world, the united states   100 billion plus '' crosstalk ''chase jarvis  russell simmons '' crosstalk  ray dalio  russell simmons ''chase jarvis  the list is   i think howard stern   it s crazy '' crosstalk  the list is pretty amazing, yes  jerry seinfeld  and the physiological or psychological effects are so fascinating, like you said, because you ll do it for a couple of days and you re like,  well, yeah, okay, whatever,  and then you hit  '' crosstalk ''chase jarvis  i m sleepy '' crosstalk  you hit this sort of inflection point where you just drop from 200 rpms to 150 and you re like,  whoa, okay, this is different,  and then, the whole week, you re kind of zenned out and then, after, say, a four week period  ''and i did my first retreat a few months ago before i volunteered for the masochism that is television production '' crosstalk ''chase jarvis  i could just hit you with a stick for a couple weeks '' crosstalk  yeah, if you could put a nail through it first, that d be great ''chase jarvis  sure  but really had this tremendous effect on me that, oddly enough   and maybe this is getting too out there for some people   but very similar to my experiences post relatively high dose hallucinogens  this extended period of calm  '' crosstalk ''chase jarvis  grace  yes '' crosstalk  or ease in decision making   uncluttered  like you closed every browser on your computer, and turned off the antivirus, and rebooted the whole thing   that type of feeling  so i did fall of the train  question for you   because, the morning session, i usually find pretty easy  afternoon, what do you do?'' crosstalk ''chase jarvis  yeah  afternoon s hard  i m right now thinking of,  okay, i ve got to go from here to the thing, to the thing  alright, when am i going to get my thing in? oh, shit   yeah, sometimes i ll try to do it in the car   like uber or whatever '' crosstalk ''chase jarvis  that s not bad '' crosstalk  but when do you typically do it in the afternoon? i m curious ''chase jarvis  i try and do it before dinner sometime   between work and dinner  we re entrepreneurs, we work   it s tough   crazy long hours so i ll take it whenever i can get it  and it s usually a little less gracious than my morning one  like you said, it s like morning is like it s your time, you carve out 20 minutes  so, my afternoon one is often a little bit more piecemeal  but, again, it s the act   i try not to judge the practice   the practice is the practice  yeah  when you meditate, are you sitting cross legged, are you sitting with your feet on the floor?''chase jarvis  i try to sit in a comfortable chair with my feet flat on the floor, hands on my lap  and there s a mantra   if you learn tm, you re given a mantra   and say that word over and over  and, if some thoughts come in, you re like,  oh, there s those thoughts  bye,  and then they go away and you keep doing it over again ''and then, sometimes, like,  oh my god, that was 25 minutes,  and, sometimes, it s like,  oh my god, that was one minute  it felt like a week   and, again, but just not judging that and   and it s   without continuing to talk about it because now it s getting weird because we re talking about it so much   but it s just a powerful tool that is so simple  i m just mind melding while you re talking ''chase jarvis  that s great  you re meditating  you re staring off into space '' crosstalk  i haven t been listening to you  for the last 20 minutes, i haven t been listening  '' crosstalk ''chase jarvis  for the listening people, tim is staring off into space right now  he s not paying attention to us  okay  that is, i think, a huge takeaway for people that it doesn t have to be tm   it could be vipassana, anything  building in a pause, just like a warm bath for your brain, even if it s ten minutes a day, so that you re not in a reactive mode   it s really a game changer  and, physiologically, had a lot of effects for me, as well '' crosstalk ''chase jarvis  oh, yeah  the studies are crazy '' crosstalk  so, when my cortisol levels dropped   i was able to lose body fat more easily in my abdomen, for instance  really became very sensitive to alcohol and caffeine so i dropped them both significantly   not because i was getting judgmental about it but because i was over sensitized to it  i d grown immune to the effects so i could have six cups of coffee a day and be like,  eh,  and did tm for four or five weeks and it was like i had one cup and i was like,  wow   i didn t realize what my baseline was  so just maybe to  '' crosstalk ''chase jarvis  it makes you a cheap date, by the way, too  i ve always been a cheap date '' music  so, with that, i thought you might like to know about some of my current meditation routines or how i m incorporating mindfulness into my day  first and foremost, upon waking, there are a few things that i do  i get up, generally take a cold shower, do some wim hoff breathing   which is a whole separate podcast   and make my bed, etc  i have my five things that i do in the morning   there s a separate episode on this   but the meditation comes in right after i ve set the kettle to boil some water or get it to 185 for tea ''i sit down, i do 21 minutes of transcendental meditation although i should 20 minutes of meditation  the first minute is really just to allow myself to fidget and get settled  i m sitting on the couch in an effectively half lotus position   i don t think that s necessary at all, you could sit with your feet on the floor   i just happen to be comfortable that way ''and for the first few minutes, i m actually mimicking the format of headspace, the app, in many ways  i m really focusing on what is happening already   the sensations of, say, my legs against the couch, the feeling of my breathing   and you could look at it as a form, in some sense, of vipassana meditation  then i segway into the mantra based tm  that is simply what i ve found to work well for me, and, oddly enough, it seems that a high percentage of men gravitate, ultimately, towards tm and high percentage of women gravitate towards vipassana ''that is not true across the board at all  sam harris, for instance, practices a number of types of meditation, none of which are tm  now, another guest who i asked about meditation was arnold schwarzenegger, the 30th governor of california, seven time mr  olympia  and something, perhaps, a lot of people don t know, he was a golden globe winner in 1976 for his role in stay hungry with jeff bridges and sally fields  he has done everything   he s reinvented himself over and over again  and the other place that you might find mindfulness in my life is where arnold also has it which is in the gym  if we re trying to cultivate present state awareness and less reactivity, you don t have to sit down and think of a mantra to do it   there are multiple ways  so that all having been said, here we go delving into meditation with no other than arnold schwarzenegger '' music  i ve heard you mention transcendental meditation in passing, briefly  do you meditate?''arnold schwarzenegger  i don t meditate now but i got heavily into it in the  70s and i remember there was a time in my life where i felt like everything s just coming together and i did not find a way   or couldn t find a way   of keeping the things separate  so it was always when i was thinking about it at the same time   i was thinking about my body building career, i was thinking about my movie career, i was thinking about the documentary pumping iron that we re shooting right now and the movie stay hungry that we just finished shooting, and my investment in the apartment building, do we get the financing from the bank   and all of this kind of stuff was always coming together and, at the same time, i was training for the mr  olympia competition in south africa  and i was training right here at gold s gym and i remember there was all the camera equipment around 5 hours a day in my face and then someone, in the middle of squatting, was trying to change the batter pack on my lifting belt and all this stuff ''so, yeah, eventually, i felt like,  i ve got to do something about it because i have such great opportunities here and everything is happening, and everything is going my way, but i m just clustering everything into one big problem rather than separating it out, and having calm, and peace, and being happy  ''and so, in a total coincidence, i ran into this guy that i ve run into many times on the beach   very, very pleasant man   who told me that he s a teacher in transcendental meditation and i said,  well, it s interesting you mention it because i feel like i should do something because i feel like i m just overly worried and have anxieties and all this stuff  and i feel certain pressures that i have never felt before   and then he says,  oh, arnold, it s not uncommon  it s very common  a lot of people go through this  this is why people use meditation  transcendental meditation is one way of dealing with problem  ''and he was very good in selling it because he didn t say it s the only answer   he just said,  it s one of many   and he says,  why don t you try it? i m a teacher there up in westwood  i would not be able to teach you since we are friends but there will be another teacher that will give you a mantra and blah, blah, blah, and teach you how to do it  and then i can help you after that,  he says,  because i will be teaching, obviously  why don t you come up on thursday? and i will be there  i will introduce you to the folks up there  ''and so i went up there, took a class, and i went home after that and then tried it  i said,  well, i ve got to give it a shot,  and i did 20 minutes in the morning, 20 minutes at night  and i would say, within 14 days, three weeks, i got to the point where i really could disconnect my mind and, as they say, to find a few seconds of this connection and rejuvenate the mind and also learn how to focus more and to calm down ''and i saw the effect right away that i was much more calm about all of the challenges that were facing me and i continued doing that, then, for a year  and, by that time, i felt like,  i think that i ve mastered this  i think that now i don t feel overwhelmed anymore   and i really felt it one of the things where, in the transcendental meditation was anxiety and pressure meeting around the corner tranquility  this is what it felt like  and so i was happy from that point and, even today, i still benefit from that because i don t merge and bring things together and see everything as one big problem   i take on one challenge at a time ''and, when i go and i study my script for a movie, then, that day   when i study my script for a movie   i don t let anything else interfere in that  i just concentrate on that  and the other thing that i ve learned is that there s many forms of meditation because, when i study and i work really hard   it takes the ultimate amount of concentration   i can only do it for 45 minutes, maybe   maybe an hour  but then i have to run off and maybe play chess  and i play chess for 15 minutes and then i can go back and have all the energy in the world again and jump right back and then continue on with my work as if i ve not done it at all today  right? it s like i m fresh  and so that s another way i think of meditation  and then i also figured out that i could use my workouts as a form of meditation because i concentrate so much on the muscle and i have my mind inside the bicep when i do my curls ''i have my mind inside the pectoral muscles when i do my bench press  so i m really inside and it s like a form of meditation because you have no chance of thinking or concentrating on anything else at that time but just that training that you do  and so there s many ways of meditation and i benefit from all of those and i m, today, much calmer, and much more organized, and much more tranquil because of that  this whole conversation makes me want to go tackle the world  i love it '' music  next, i want to reintroduce one of my most popular and controversial guests, sam harris  he is brilliant  sam has a ph d  in neuroscience and the author of many best selling books including, the end of faith, freewill, lyin, and waking up ''our first conversation on this podcast explored science, different types of meditation and the uses and risks of psychedelics among many other things and that conversation included segments such as this '' music  there s a quote here that is,  there s nothing irrational about seeking the states of mind that lie at the core of many religions  compassion, awe and devotion, feelings of oneness are surely among the most valuable experiences a person can have   assuming that s true   and you and i have, of course, talked about altered states and you ve written about altered states   i d love to just dig into that expression or that quote, rather, and look at the alternate approaches that you ve perhaps explored or researched related to achieving some of these valuable states ''sam harris  mm hmm  yeah  so, in the beginning of my career, as you point out, i spent a lot of time criticizing religion and criticizing it for its obvious harms ''but one of its harms that s not so obvious is that it keeps us talking about this positive end of human experience   this self transcendence and highly normative states of consciousness in first century or seventh century terms and most people, most of the time, think that the only way to capture  spiritual experience    and one s interest in it and the ways in which one would explore it   is to, to some degree, indulge the myth intoxicated language of the iron age  there s just no way to talk about it otherwise  science hasn t given us the tools to talk about it, secular tools doesn t give us the tools to talk about it, and so we re left talking about being christians, and muslims, and jews, and buddhists and organize our lives around the really incompatible truth claims and doctrines that you find in those religions''and very smart people who are secular in every other way think there s just no alternative to that and so one of my main interests now is in articulating an alternative because, clearly, there are extraordinary experiences that people have and many of these experiences do lie at the core of many of our religions  and so, to take jesus as an obvious example   who knows who jesus actually was and what is historically true in the new testament? but let s just say, for our argument s sake, that there really was a guy who loved his neighbor as himself and had this extraordinarily charismatic effect on the people around him, and bore witness to this possibility of a radical self transcendence  well, clearly, whatever s true there is deeper than christianity and it s not reducible to christianity ''in fact, christianity has to be a distortion of that truth and we know this because jesus isn t the only person who s had that experience  there s the buddha and then countless contemplatives through the ages can attest to this experience of, for lack of a better phrase, unconditional love and that has some relationship to what i would call self transcendence which i think is even more important  and so there s this phenomenon that s clearly deeper than any of our provincial ways of talking about it in the context of religion  and so there s a deeper truth of human psychology and the nature of consciousness and i think we need to explore it in terms that don t require that we lie to ourselves or to our children about the nature of reality and that we don t indulge this divisive language of picking teams in the contest among religions ''so, yeah, my next book that s coming out in the fall is called waking up  a guide to spirituality without religion and it s about the phenomenon of self transcendence and the ways in which people can explore it without believing anything on insufficient evidence  and one of the principal ways is various techniques of meditation   mindfulness being, i think, the most useful one to adopt first  there s also the use of psychedelic drugs which is not quite the same as meditation but it does, if nothing else, it reveals that the human nervous system is plastic in a very important way which means your experience of the world can be very radically transformed  you are tending to be who you were yesterday by virtue of various habit patterns and physiological homeostasis and other things that are keeping you very recognizable to yourself but it s possible to have a very different experience ''and it s possible to do that through pharmacology, it s possible to do that through some kind of crisis or it s possible to do it through a deliberate form of training like meditation  and i think it s crucial to do because we all want to be as happy, and as fulfilled, or as free of pain and suffering as we can possibly be and all of our suffering and all of our unhappiness is a product of how our minds are in every moment  and so, if there s a way to use the mind itself to improve one s capacity for moment to moment well being   which i m convinced there is   then this should be potentially of interest to everybody  so a couple of quick questions on all of the subjects  so the first i d like to touch on, meditation   i think we can probably touch on this briefly   is something we ve discussed before  you, along with many other people who are high performers in their respective fields have recommended meditation so i have been meditating, partially in thanks to your influence for some time now  is it safe to say that the meditation that you most frequently recommend to novices is vipassana meditation or is that  ?''sam harris  yeah  okay  got it  why is that? i ve experimented with a number of different types   transcendental meditation, vipassana, of course, and have taken a number of courses   why that selection? why that choice?''sam harris  yeah, it has a few obvious strengths that are actually not shared by any other technique i know of  the first is that it doesn t   it needn t   presuppose any belief about anything ''you don t have to develop a fondness for the iconography of buddhism  you don t have to care about the buddha  you don t have to believe in rebirth, or karma   none of the doctrine of buddhism need be adopted in order to get the practice off the ground and never need be adopted if it never makes any sense which much of it doesn t  you don t have to become a buddhist to do this and you don t have to add anything strategically to your experience as a mechanism by which to meditate  so you re not adding a mantra, you re not visualizing something that isn t there  you don t have to look at a candle flame or do anything to your environment by way of artifice to create the circumstance of meditation  all you re doing is paying exquisitely close and non judgmental attention to whatever you re experiencing anyway ''and the first technique you use to be able to train that capacity is to focus on your breath which you always have with you and is just an easy objective to focus on  but it doesn t even have to be the breath   mindfulness is just that quality of mind which allows you to pay attention to sights, and sounds, and sensations, and even thought themselves without being lost in thought and without grasping it was pleasant and pushing what is an unpleasant away  so, just being wide open to the next sensory or emotional experience that comes careening into consciousness   that is mindfulness  and so, in some sense, it s not even a practice, it s just the state of not being distracted and being aware  and it feels like a practice in the beginning because it s hard to do   we re so deeply conditioned to be lost in thought and to be having this conversation with ourselves from the moment we wake up to the moment we fall asleep ''it just chatter in the mind and we re so captivated that we re not even aware of it  we are essentially in a dream state and it s through this veil of thought that we go about our day and perceive our environments but we are just talking to ourselves non stop and, until you can break that spell and begin to notice thoughts, themselves, as objects of consciousness just arising and passing away, you can t even pay attention to your breath or anything else with any kind of clarity ''and so, initially, you have to develop some concentration and get mindfulness in depth so that you can pay attention but, once you can pay attention, it doesn t matter what you pay attention to  there s nothing, in principle, that is outside the meditation process  there s nothing that s, in principle, that s a distraction  you don t need a quiet environment   you can have loud construction noises going across the street and it s just as good of circumstance for meditation as anything else ''and those are the main reasons why i think it s the, in terms of being designed for export outside of buddhist culture or religious culture, generally, and becoming a tool for our intellectual lives in a secular, scientific context, i think there s nothing like it  what resources would you suggest for someone who wants to try to educate themselves or dive in as a novice in terms of books, resources, websites for mindfulness and meditation?''sam harris  yeah  well, i give a few on my blog  i wrote an article a couple years ago entitled,  how to meditate,  and, if people google that, they ll see that i link to a few books and i tell people where they can go on retreats and i briefly describe the practice  i also have given a couple of guided mindfulness meditations i ve put on soundcloud which are on my website as well ''and there are other guided meditations out there that people can use  and, in the beginning, some people find that very helpful to have somebody s voice essentially reminding them to not be lost in thought every few seconds  because what happens in the beginning for people   and this happened to me in my practice for at least a year   i think it was a year before i went on intensive silent retreat  i was just sitting for an hour a day or so just on my own  i was 20 or so and, essentially, i was just sitting cross legged, thinking  it s so hard to notice that you re lost in thought that, by tendency, you re just not going to notice it  and so, in the beginning, people think that they re meditating and they re really just lost in thought  and it wasn t until i did my first ten day vipassana retreat where i broke through and connected with the practice in a way where i realized,  wow ''all of that that has preceded this was really my thinking i was meditating and not meditating   and there are other landmarks along my journey that are like that   where it was a shift where i realized,  wow  this what i thought was happening really was not happening as i thought it was,  and that s a very common experience  and so, in the beginning, using a guided meditation can help cut through the chatter in a way that many people can t summon on their own  well, let me take a side step which is people ask me,  hat blogs do you read?  and there really aren t many blogs that i read consistently aside from a handful  and partially, i read your blog and the posts you put up because they re like feature magazine articles in many cases  and there s one you wrote in 2011 called,  drugs and the meaning of life,  and you ve written about this subject before ''i have found certain hallucinogens, in particular, to be very therapeutically valuable for cutting through the chatter and turning that off, and bringing present state awareness to you in a very high definition way when used responsibly  and, of course, as you point out in this piece, it s not to say that everyone should take psychedelics but i d be curious to know   one of the lines here   that needs to be read in context, of course, but  i have a daughter who will one day take drugs  of course, i ll do everything in my power to see that she chooses her drugs wisely but a life without drugs is not foreseeable nor, i think, desirable  ''then you obviously go through the how you might guide her to view these different subjects and one of the closing lines in this paragraph is,  but, if she doesn t not try a psychedelic like psilocybin or lsd at least one in her adult life, i will worry that she may have missed one of important rites of passage a human being can experience   and i agree with this ''i d be curious to hear what particular drugs or psychedelic substances you ve found most therapeutically valuable in your own life and how you suggest people think about this  obviously, you have to put the potential legal ramifications in perspective, also, but what have you personally found most valuable and how so?''sam harris  yeah, well, again, you found another paragraph where i was happy to court controversy   to say that i ll be disappointed if my daughter doesn t drop acid  but the caveat here   and the caveat comes out several times in that piece   which everybody should read in full  i m not trying to pull anything out of context  i just don t want to read the whole thing to them now ''sam harris  yeah  i stand by every word but there are a lot of words in there and the caveat is that i have an increasingly healthy respect for what can go wrong on psychedelics and wrong in a way that i think has lasting consequences for people ''and there s a lot that can go right with psychedelics and, to some degree, i think they re still indispensable for a lot of people   they certainly seem to be indispensable for me  i don t think i ever would have discovered meditation without having taken, in particular, mdma, but mdma, mushrooms, and lsd all played a role for me in unveiling an inner landscape that was worth exploring  but for that pharmacological advantage, i think my consciousness was such that i looked inside, i saw nothing of interest, and that s sort of the end of the conversation  you tell me that there s something profound to witness about the nature of my own mind   i don t see it  i just want to get on with the next thing in the world that seems fun to do or seems likely to lead to my success ''i just was a skin encapsulated ego that was just trying to get on with life and succeed and thought he was very clever and didn t have the contemplative tools to see much of anything when he paid attention  and that s a situation that many people are in and many smart people are in that position  so i m constantly meeting scientists, and philosophers, and highly articulate people who spend a lot of time thinking about the nature of the human mind and, when i talk to them about meditation or really any of these philosophical issues that, for which, an ability to pay attention to the nature of your own consciousness is an advantage  so something like free will or the nature of the self, of the possibility of self transcendence   i m meeting people who have, as far as i can tell, no ability to notice their inner lives ''there s people who, some of them seem to not to have inner lives but these are people who are very much the way i was when i was 18 before i had had any experience with any of this  there s just you re lost in thought, and you don t know it, and that phrase  lost in thought,  means nothing to you, and you don t have the tools by which to do anything with it even if it meant something to you, and there s just nothing  and you re cognitively closed to data and the data are to be found   the most important point of which   is, the self you think you are is an illusion  this sense of being a self, riding around in your head, this feeling of  i,  this feeling that everyone calls  i,  is an illusion that can be disconfirmed in a variety of ways ''its boundaries can be transformed in ways or it can be completely cut through and vanish for a moment, or a minute, or potentially for the rest of one s life so it s vulnerable to inquiry  and that inquiry can take many forms but the unique power of psychedelics is that there s a unique power and a unique liability  the unique power and liability is that they are guaranteed to work in some way   and this is a point that terence mckenna always made  terence mckenna was a huge booster of psychedelics   and a very articulate one   and he poo pooed any other spiritual methodology, meditation, and chanting, and yoga, and anything else that people brought to him saying,  can t you get the same benefit without drugs? ''and his point was,  well, you teach someone to meditate, you teach them yoga, there s no guarantee whatsoever that something s going to happen  they could spend a week doing it, they could spend a year doing it   who knows what s going to happen? they may just get bored and they re going to wander away from this thing not knowing that there was a  there  there  if i give you five grams of mushrooms or 300 micrograms of lsd and tell you to sit on that couch for an hour, you are guaranteed to have a radical transformation in your experience ''it doesn t matter who you are   this freight train of significance is going to come bearing down on you and we just have to watch the clock and know it s going to happen and that s a fact   so that s the advantage because you re guaranteed to realize, at the end of that episode, that it is possible to have a radically different experience than you tend to have  and, if you have a good experience, you re going realize that human life can be just unutterably sublime   that it s possible to feel at home in the universe in a way that you couldn t have previously imagined ''but, if you have a bad experience   and the bad experiences are every bit as bad as the good experiences are good   you will have just this harrowing encounter with madness  and it s as pathological as any lunatic who s wandering the street raving to himself and completely cut off from others  you can have that experience and, hopefully, it goes away   and, universally, in every case, it does go away   but it s still rough and it still has consequences for people  some of the consequences are good   i happen to think that it gives you a basis for compassion, in particular, for people who are suffering mental illness that you couldn t otherwise have but it s not an experience that i m eager to have again  so my healthy respect for the power of psychedelics has led me to not take many for many years ''it s been years since i ve taken anything and my use tapered off in my 20s when i got into meditation and was spending more time on retreat and beginning to feel that i was hitting the center of the bullseye with meditation in a way that i was certainly not guaranteed to with psychedelics and i basically stopped using everything and just practiced meditation  but there s no question that i wouldn t have become sufficiently interested in meditation but for the experiences i had on lsd and mdma in particular '' music  to round out this deep dive into meditation, i wanted to relive a conversation that i had with rainn wilson, who is perhaps best known as dwight on nbc s emmy award winning the office  he shared an incredible insight to a very simple question we all face from time to time '' music ''when you feel overwhelmed, what do you do to improve the situation?''rainn wilson  well, i have a spiritual faith that i rely on that i use so i use prayer and meditation as tools to center me and bring me back into reality  i also find that, for me, acting is a wonderful escape because you get out of your own head and you get to go into someone else s head  and it was like that on the office, too, and doing comedy  when life was good, and life was bad   there was something wonderful about coming to dwight  and i could just put rainn wilson aside and just all of that bullshit, and clear it out of my head and out of my heart, and just be dwight shrute ''and, sometimes, it was just super, super fun to do that  so those are some of the tools  acting is a tool, prayer and meditation is a tool i use to bring myself into the world  and your faith   i know i m going to massacre this because i ve only read it and not heard it said   but is it baha i?''rainn wilson  yeah, baha i  baha i  there we go  thank you ''rainn wilson  baha i   like  hi, how you doing?  yeah  and i want to come back to that but, when you meditate, what does that look like and do you do it on a daily basis? what s the format of that?''rainn wilson  yeah, i try and meditate every day  there s no format in the baha i faith   it s just greatly encouraged to meditate  when you pray, you re communicating with the creator, you re communicating with the universe, you re putting stuff out there, and, when you re meditating, you re listening to the universe  but it s really pretty simple  i get a great deal of benefit if i even do a 10 minute meditation and, out of that 10 minutes, if 4 of the minutes my mind can be very still and very silent ''there s great guided meditations now  there s apps, there s all kinds of things you can do for meditation  but, for me, it s just about   i won t say silencing the mind because that s impossible because those thoughts are always going to pop up   but, when those thoughts pop up, you just notice them, you identify them, you let them float in front of your eyes almost like one of those old fashioned wall street ticker machines  and you find  i find   a tremendous amount of peace, serenity, and bliss in just being in consciousness  and consciousness is not thought, consciousness is just being    i am this being  i am not separate from the giant being of earth, and the cosmos, and the universe   and just being in that stillness is incredibly rewarding  i get really a ton of clarity and i get a ton of energy from it ''and these have been proven in scientific studies, by the way, in all kinds of things from healing trauma, to giving you more energy, to giving you more focus in your work  meditation is a pretty incredible tool  and lowering cortisol  i ve been spending time interacting with some researchers at johns hopkins   a gentleman named roland griffiths and also a gent named adam gazalley who runs a neuroimaging lab at ucsf  and what s been very interesting   and we don t have to go down the rabbit hole with this   but it appears that, if you look at experienced meditators and brain activity   and i m blanking on the particular area, i think it might be somewhere in the parietal lobe but i could be off  in any case, there s a portion of the brain that is thought to contribute to the separation of self and other  so it s inhibited both in the use of, say, psilocybin, which was found in magic mushrooms, but also you experience a similar type of pattern in experienced meditators which is kind of cool '' crosstalk ''rainn wilson  well, i know that they   oh, sorry, go ahead''tim ferriss  go ahead ''rainn wilson  yeah, i heard a fascinating thing on the radio once where they did a study and they found the happiest man in the world  so they did a brain scan and they found the happiest person they could possibly find  and this guys was   i think he was an american, he was living in wisconsin   but he was a student of tibetan buddhism  and, at the time when they did the brain scan   which charted out as the very happiest   he was in the process of meditating and it was a meditation of universal compassion so it s a meditation where you re feeling at one with everyone and great compassion for everyone on the planet earth and all beings on planet earth   human, animal, plant   what they re going through ''and, in so doing, that achieved the greatest happiness  that goes along with what you re saying  no, definitely  and, even if you are self interested, there s a biological benefit to empathy, and compassion, and meditation  so i just want to reiterate something you said because i think it s so important is that i try to meditate 20 minutes each morning and, like you mentioned, there are apps like calm and headspace that are very helpful for this   but even if i m just violently, excuse me, let me try english again, violently getting punched in the psyche by my to do list, and worries, and anxieties, and thoughts for 15, or even 18 minutes out of 20, if i have 2 minutes where the mud settles and the mind is clear, it has an incredible impact on the entire day for me ''rainn wilson  i feel exactly the same way  that s exactly my experience  even out of a 10 minute meditation, if i can just get two or three minutes in there where i have almost achieved thoughtlessness and just a serene bliss, it s like taking a powernap and it helps you through your whole day  definitely  and i think it was tara broch who said this to me   it might have been someone else   but they said,  if you just come back to your breath, or a mantra, or whatever it is that you re focusing on if you re doing concentrated meditation, it s the coming back that is the practice  so, if you re just distracted and you re basically just bouncing off the walls with your monkey mind for those 19 minutes, if you come back even once, you can consider it a successful session  and i think, for type a personalities, that s really important to keep in mind ''rainn wilson  yeah  you mentioned something i d love to explore a little bit which is that acting can be a wonderful escape   and i m paraphrasing here   from your own head ''i was actually watching amy yesterday   which is a documentary about amy winehouse and very sad story, tragic on many levels   but she produced some beautiful music from bad experiences and she was able to escape her own head by putting these poems which became songs on paper  are there any particular exercises from whether it s acting school, or improv, or otherwise, that you think could benefit non actors who just want to help create new avenues of thinking or embrace some type of therapeutic effect of getting outside their own head?''rainn wilson  yeah, specific ones, i suppose i could go into, but i studied with a great teacher at nyu named paul walker   he died of aids   but he was an exquisite teacher and he taught theater games ''and, for me, that was a real revelation because, when i had tried acting early on, i was very stiff, and very in my head, and cerebral, and stuck, and it was very conscious like,  how am i going to say this line?  and  how do i best look when i m turning this way?  it was just a very self conscious style of acting that was bad  it was sucky  so what paul got us doing in acting school at nyu was just playing and there s something incredibly freeing about playing like a kid and that your impulses as an actor and your impulses as a kid at play are really the same thing  like i said before, it s deeply pretending  so are there specific exercises? i suppose i could think of some but how much fun is it to play  red light, green light  for 20 minutes or  duck, duck, goose,  and then to move from those exercises into more and more imaginative improvisations but where you allow yourself to just play like a child ''and, sometimes, children play and they re competitive, sometimes, they play and they re very serious   it s not all this general,  whee,  stuff  and i found that so freeing and it was the key for me as an actor that broke me open, and got me out of my head, and just got me in my body, and in that place of pure imagination and spontaneity that you really want as an actor  mm hmm  and i think it seems to me, also, when you put yourself in that place   much like meditation, you have to be present state aware  you can t be worrying about something that you have scheduled two weeks in the future or resenting something like some idiot who cut you off in traffic that morning  you have to be in that moment, and be effective, and to have fun  you just can t be distracted by those things ''rainn wilson  yeah, like we ll do a thing where you   i just remember because i did it recently where i did sessions with the employees at soul pancake, games and improv stuff   where everyone has a number from 1 to 10 ''there s two teams of ten on each side of the room  there s a stool in the center of the room with a shoe on it and the goal is you ve got to get the shoe and then get back to your place in line  right? it s a pretty simple game  but then you also do this game called,  sexy nostril,  where you write down adjectives and you write down body parts so it could be  angry,   sad,   lonely,   energetic    those are the adjectives and then body parts,  earlobe,   testicle,   anus,   shoulder blade,   fingernail,  whatever  and you draw one of each and then you try and play a game manifesting those characteristics  so, if you have  sexy nostril,  then you have to play that same game of getting the shoe and getting back in line but you re a person where the center of their energy is in their nostril and it s a very sensual, sexual energy ''and it helps you create a character and play as that character, and it takes you out of your head and it just gets you in your body and gets you feeling and responding  i love teaching that stuff  it s super fun  and, for me, tim, i m in my head a lot and it kind of sucks '' crosstalk  yeah, me, too '' crosstalk ''rainn wilson  so there s certain tools that i have to use to get by  so i ve learned in my life   i don t remember every day   but there s certain things i have to do to just be out of my head and just to get to normal  i m not talking about being really super effective  just to get to normal, i have to do meditation  i have to do some exercise  if i can get into nature, great  if i can play some tennis, better  and acting is that same way   acting, rehearsing, playing characters   these are the things that get me out of my head and out of just analyzing every goddamn thing that comes down the pike and leaves me miserable and making really bad choices  well, there you have it, folks   my first episode of the tim ferriss radio hour with some of the superstars, some of the experts that i ve spoken to over the past few years  and this is an experiment, as i said at the top of the show  i want to know what did you like? what did you not like? how can it be improved? do you want more of these or should we just skip it? that s totally fair as well  what topics would you like me to most explore or consolidate? what types of patterns? in other words, i just want your feedback so please let me know what did you like, what didn t you like, what should i do more of, less of? and you can ping me on twitter,    t f e r r i s s   or on the blog at fourhourworkweek com blog  if you re a facebooker   you love the facebooks   you could go to facebook com timferriss with two  r s  and two  s s  but, generally speaking, twitter is going to be the best means of communication for now    please let me know your thoughts and, as always and until next time, thank you for listening '"
204,212,What I Learned in 2016 (#212),"'last year i did a recap of a number of things that i d learned from podcast guests  i m not going to do that this year because the tools of titans book handles that very, very nicely and includes all of the highlights  so rather than do that, i thought i would run through, since it s been a common request, what i do at the end of a year  and this is going to hold true for at least the last six years  and i say six years because around 2011, i recall being at a fancy conference  i m not going to mention it by name  a fantastic conference, very small, i d say about 150 people  and it spanned about three days  and it happened to cross over new year s  and i recall sitting outside on a patio having a glass of wine with a number of folks, and getting a text from my mother ''and the text informed me that the young daughter of one of my childhood mentors had died of cancer  i think it was liver cancer  this really forced me in a way to step back  and i walked away from the party, i called my mom and i spoke with her  and realized that for me new years isn t, and it s really never been about the rager parties  i ve done that, but what i did that night is as i sat down   i was slightly buzzed, but i did a complete review and recap of the last year  and i focused on that instead of on resolutions  therefore when i think of a new year, and the end of a year including this year 2016, what i try to do is a post game analysis and really look back at the year  so i thought i would share a few things that i ve learned, and then a few of the practices that i use ''as always it takes the form of a big pile of notes, a jumbled mess of things with columns and circles and stars, and so on that i will later put into some semblance of sanity  but i ve had about 12 pounds of leftover turkey and mashed potatoes, as well as probably 17 pounds of danish butter cookies and chocolate, so please bear with me if my brain stumbles here and there like a drunk sailor  that is the state of affairs ''alright, number one, let me share a few things that i ve learned by studying and listening to and speaking with two people  the first is oprah  i have not met oprah winfrey in person, but listen to a fantastic miniseries  i think it was done by wbez  i may be getting the call sign incorrect, but a chicago based public radio outfit created a three part miniseries called the making of oprah, or making oprah ''and it s very easy to find  there are a few things i took from it, among many, many others  so the first is really a few core beliefs of oprah s and these ended up being mantras that a lot of her producers would repeat because they would be told this frequently by oprah herself ''so the first is there are only two emotions, love and fear  so even if you disagree with that statement, i wrote it down because i think it can be used as a powerful question  if we assume there are only two emotions, love and fear, which in this moment are you feeling, or which is causing you to behave in a certain way? and as tony robbins has said to me and has said on the podcast  stressed, i m just a little bit stressed, and so unstressed is the achiever word for fear ''so there are only two emotions, love and fear ''next up, this is something she learned after a particular episode with skinheads  this was in 1988  and oprah had in the beginning to of course, in sweep season and otherwise, try to raise ratings and viewership for particular episodes  she had skinheads on at one point to talk about race  and she realized at some point, i think in the middle of the episode, that she was not using them as part of her agenda  they were using her, and that she had provided a vehicle for spreading darkness in the world, in a sense  and that it was not going to be constructive  it was actually going to be destructive  so she made the decision not to represent darkness in the world, and this is a binary decision  so i think that it is very useful again as a lens through which to view your decisions and projects, and so on ''are you attempting to at the very least be a force for good in the world? or even if you are not perpetuating darkness, committing dark acts? are you representing darkness in the world, meaning providing a stage for it, or writing about it in a way, covering it in a way that is not intended to provoke an action to mitigate it, etc ? alright, so that was the second thing i wrote down ''and then the next was, you can only run your own race  and this is something that she would tell her producers if they were concerned about what the competition was doing  if you re in a race, say a horse race, and you look back to see what someone is doing behind you, you ll very frequently fall behind and then get second or third place  so you can only run your own race, keep your blinders on, and focus on your strengths effectively ''next up we have seth godin  seth godin, i ve had the pleasure of spending some time with and these are a few things that he mentioned to me  and this is probably in fact at the last shopify build a business competition winter gathering, that i took these notes ''he mentioned a number of books  one was called cult your brand  the next was debt, which he s talked about on my podcast with him, as well  the very first episode, i believe  the gift by lewis hyde, and lewis hyde has some fantastic other books, including one on trickster mythology, if you re into that type of thing as i am  and then understanding comics, and they re a bunch of random bullets  cramer knives, he likes cramer knives, c r a m e r  one of his lines was  doing more is a four letter word   and then there were two that really stuck with me ''he also was a big fan   and is a big fan   of the mystery show, episode number three  this is a podcast produced by gimlet media ''and then there are two more  be happy with 20,000 customers  if you delight them, you ll never lose them but you will lose them if you try to go for 20 million people  and i don t think they re always mutually exclusive, but i think this is very good to keep in mind in a world obsessed with scaling and more, and doubling, and hockey sticking, and so on  that s all fine and good, but i think that it s very easy to be romanticized by lingo used for venture back startups, and to shoot yourself in the foot, or in some cases shoot yourself in the face ''so in almost all instances, something like one thousand true fans, written by kevin kelly   which an essay i recommend everybody read  there s an updated version in tools of titans, and i think he s also put it on his site at kk org, so you can check that out    leads to all good things, that is a necessary component whether you want to be a  60 plus billion dollar valued startup, or you want to simply make an extra  25,000,  50,000,  100,000 a year ''next, this is perhaps the key and i circled this several times on this piece of paper that i ve kept now for quite some time, and here s the question that he posted   if i had to charge two times more, that is, and couldn t do any paid advertising, what would i do instead? ''so if i were targeting that at you, if you had to charge two times what you re currently charging for your product or service, and couldn t do any paid advertising, what would you do instead? and this is something i ve thought about a lot, and it is a fantastic question  and most of my yearly reviews take the form of a series of questions  and some of them i ll bring up, but most of them occur in the  17 questions that changed my life  chapter in tools of titans, which also i put on the blog  so you can find that even if you don t have the book  just go to fourhourblog com or search my name, tim ferriss 17 questions  it will pop right up ''the review often takes the form of many questions, and this can be one of them  if you had to charge two times as much, but couldn t do any paid advertising, what would you do instead? and i ll very often back into the features, so to speak, of a product, or a high priced event in my case, where i decided that i wanted to charge twice as much as the closest competitor ''the closest competitor, so to speak   or i shouldn t say competitor  it s really comparable   was priced at  5,000 a head  i decided to price at  10,000 a head, and then work backwards to create an experience that would be worth  10,000 a head ''okay, so that is seth  we ve covered seth  we ve covered oprah  let s talk about 80 20 analysis  when i look back at my year, and i do this in a very particular way, i will look at my ical on my mac, and i will start with january 1, in this case of 2016, and go through my entire calendar day by day  and this does not need to take a very long time  it really only takes certainly less than an hour  i will ask myself two questions as filters at the beginning  then i have a piece of paper as i do right now, and there s a plus sign at the top of one column, and a negative sign at the top of the other ''what i m looking for is the following  the 20 percent of activities, experiences, or people, who produced 80 percent or more of my most positive emotions  these are the things that i want, positive emotions and positive outcomes, although they re not always perfectly correlated  so the 20 percent of activities, experiences, or people, who produced 80 percent or more of the most positive emotions i experienced that year  and then on the flipside, you have the 20 percent of activities, experiences, and people, who produced 80 percent or more of the negative emotions, the stress, the bullshit in your life, the angst, the anger, whatever it might be, that you would want to remove or excise from your life, or at least minimize  and i created my various categories  it turned out  i did a very good job in 2016, much more so than in 2014, or 2015, at following my own rules ''so what does this mean? this means that i had a lot more in the positive category, because i had identified patterns in the past  so i look at these experiences and then i try to spot patterns  what are the commonalities? fr instance, in my positive column for this past year, i have a trip to south america, to do an acro yoga intensive training course  i had a family trip in june, which was to paris, where i took my parents to paris for a month, because my mom had never been, and my dad hadn t been seen the  60s  a ski trip to montana and friends  and elk hunt, which was in colorado with three very close friends  i didn t end up getting an elk, but that s kind of beside the point  and then the easter island trip with peter tia, david sabatini, and nav shantel ''if you look at the commonalities here there are a few elements  so i have extended trips off the grid, meaning no social media, no email, etc , a physical component, some form of rigorous daily movement or exercise, and time with family and close friends  then are a few other things  if you looked at positives, looking at the negative space for the positives  no startup investing  so i ve followed my own decision to retire effectively from startup investing, which you can read about ad nauseam if you just search my name and startup vacation  and then lots of empty space  i d blocked out of lots of empty space to my calendar so that i would have the maneuverability and space to change direction, or say hell yes, to the few things that i wanted to along the lines of derek sivers  alright, so those are a few of things that i did right ''now, let me add one more thing  before taking an action step, and i ll explain what that step is, i also asked a number of people very close to me what do you think i should do more of in 2017, and less of in 2017? what should i do more of and what should i do less of? and there were some general responses that you could receive from multiple people, like do less of whatever you view to be a chore or an obligation  and we ll talk about how you might do less of those things ''now on the positive side, they said teaching  perhaps you should spend more time interacting with high school students  i enjoy that and i ve done a number of things with high school students, and i do things with high school students every year in some capacity, whether it s through donor s choose, or questbridge, or build  these real nonprofits that i work with related to education  a few of my closest friends have seen me interact with high school students, and have observed how much i love that, so they said you should do more of that ''next was live podcasts and q a  this was feedback that i got from friends who attended the new york city event at the 92y and saw me do a live event  so one thing i am considering doing, and i d love your feedback guys, is having a podcast tour  taking my dog molly, putting her in an rv, and driving around the u s  doing live podcasts in some well known cities certainly, like say in la, or san francisco, or seattle, or new york, miami, chicago, austin, whatever it might be  but also doing some more out of the way spots  maybe a few smaller towns in nebraska, or in montana, for instance  so let me know what you think of that ''the way i might do that is, if anybody wants to take the initiative now, this is probably what i ll end up doing is have people create facebook groups for tools of titans  so it would be a tools of titans group austin, tools of titans group omaha, whatever it might be, tools of titans group charleston  and then the people who are able, the organizers or groups who are able to amass the highest number of people, or past a certain threshold, say 250 people or 500 people, i don t know what the number is it yet, but let s just say it s 250  then they go into the contenders  list for these live podcasts  this is a very likely thing to happen, i think ''okay, next up was more sunrises  i tend to be a very late riser  late to bed, late to rise  and i always feel fantastic when i do get up for a sunrise  that is not something that i ve done consistently, so that s another one  and then consistent feedback  more time out of cities in the country ''so that matches up with the montana, south america, the colorado trip, easter island, etc  so once i have these patterns spotted after doing this positive 80 20 analysis and negative 80 20 analysis, then i start putting things into the calendar  if it is not in the calendar, it is not real  i ve already started scheduling the fun stuff, and there are a few ways that i ve done this  so number one is i almost always do something with my family for christmas, so that s one extended trip ''this year was an exception  we took a year off of that because we wanted to do it at home  also a trip around june or july  now, why is this important? it s important because with these extended trips, and of course i m just pulling a number out of my ass, but i would say 90 percent of the gift is to yourself and others  the anticipation of the experience  this is why it s so important to schedule and block it out ahead of time ''so extended trip midyear  extended trip at the end of the year  that means you have something to look forward to every six months  alright, now there are a few reasons that i started doing this  so you re going to put these various trips, these various activities, etc , in the calendar  one of the reasons i started focusing on these types of in advance purchases was because i read a book, and i would give it really a 7 out of 10  there are aspects of the book that i perhaps disagree with, but i ll get to that  the title of the book is happy money  the science of happier spending  this is by elizabeth dunn and michael norton, and really it answers the question  can money by happiness?  the answer is that money is   well, these are my words   necessary, but not sufficient in a way for happiness per say, but can you use money to increase your wellbeing and effectively happiness in different degrees?''and the answer is yes, absolutely  so they focus on five core principles  there are some issues with the social science observational data confusing correlation with causation, etc , all of that  but i did find it useful as thinking of a framework  some of the questions they would ask are   and i know we re jumping around  this is the danish butter cookies and caffeine in action  but the questions they might ask would include when you re considering a purchase, how will this affect how i use my time? so for any purchase, how will this affect how i use my time? that s a good one to write down  this is actually very versatile  it could be something you re considering doing in the future  it could purchasing this and anticipating enjoying it six months from now affect how i use my time now, etc ? next is how will i use this thing on tuesday nights?''next tuesday, how i will i use this on tuesday nights, or next tuesday? in effect what you re doing is you re turning decisions of dollars into decisions of time  how purchases will affect how you use your time  so another analysis that i do, or review, in addition to the ical or calendar review and 80 20 analysis positive and negative is i ll go through my five minute journal  so many of you have heard me talk about this before  the five minute journal has a series of prompts that you answer in the morning and at night  it takes about five minutes, certainly less than that  three minutes in the morning, maybe three minutes at night  there are a few bullets at the end, such as three amazing things that happened today  how could i have made today better, and i am grateful for, at the very top  when you go through your logs and you read your entries, which are one page apiece in the five minute journal, you will spot patterns  this informs also how you then start to put things into your calendar and schedule ''alright, when i read this book happy money, this was some time ago, i started to do quite a few things  i would ask questions, and i m going to ask these types of questions of myself now  and this relates also to something that a gent named dan sullivan, who owns a company called strategic coach  this is a point he has made, which is if you have money to solve a problem, it isn t a problem  and i m a paraphrasing here  so there are certain questions you can ask yourself  i have these written down  i m saying so a lot  it seems like that might be the 100 percent cacao chocolate kicking in  alright,  100 00 to most increase happiness, question mark  if i could only use a  100 00 right now to most increase my happiness, what would it be? how would i apply it? and then i have  500 00 to most increase happiness, question mark   1,000 to most increase happiness, question mark ''last year some of the answers were gymnastics rack  that is a stall bar, or a stall wall, ala gymnastic strength training, as well as pads  these are sort of roll out gymnastics mats, effectively, for doing acro yoga and so on  and i did purchases these things, and they did dramatically improve both my physical wellbeing and just general psychological wellbeing  so the direct translation  check, check, they both really worked  and then, this of course dependent on your particular financial situation, but if you were to take, say, 10 to 20 percent of your liquid income that you can afford to lose  this is important   10 to 20 percent of your liquid cash, let s just call it, that you can afford to lose  how would you apply it to increase your quality of life? and this comes back to sort of spending money to affect how you utilize your time  are there three things that you would most like to add to your life  three things you would most like to remove from your life?''i don t know why i like thinking in threes so much, but i find it very helpful  so one of them, for me, was figuring out   this was last year   how to completely extricate myself from a lot of the tax and estate planning management aspects in my life and my family s  another one, i did not end up doing this, i guess this was probably a little bit over a year ago  i put matchmaker, question mark  wing woman, question mark  i m not sure if you can pay for a wing woman  you probably can  but i was thinking matchmaker because a friend of mine, a very successful guy, actually met a wonderful woman, and they ended up getting married through a matchmaker  i was like you know what? maybe all this online stuff is a little too complicated and time consuming  i did not end up going to that ''small things  a rumba  getting a rumba  i identified that very often when i had people clean my house, and it was done pretty frequently, it was because molly, my dog, was shedding all over the place  the rest of the house was fine  i didn t need dusting, i didn t need any pots and pans and so on cleaned  i didn t need any of that  i just needed dog hair picked up and i was over paying  and it was kind of bothering me because i would come back, and i can afford to pay for a cleaner, but i have this very particular sensitivity to people moving my shit around  my books would be moved around, my cups would be moved around  it s stupid, yes, i know, but i m sensitive to it  so i got a rumba at the end of the day  there were a couple of different models  i m still not 100 percent happy with them, but i have found them very, very valuable ''and then you go down the list  like could i pay for every possible virtual reality demonstration, vr demos? train dogs at shelters  this is really something at pay  this is more of something to add to life to increase my sense of wellbeing and contribution, which actually does apply to this happy money book that i mentioned ''prepaying for massages, etc  okay, prepaying is an important concept  i won t get into all the whys right now, but i did decide for an eight week period to prepay for acro yoga training with two instructors  we can discuss another time why  i think it s better in almost every case with an individual sport, or craft, in both cases to not do one on one lessons, so you want either another student with you with another teacher, or you want two teachers, and then yourself  that tends to be a much better use of your time, in terms of adding steroids to the learning curve ''but i ended up developing a curriculum, and prepaying for two to three times per week of acro yoga with one or two teachers, mostly two  and i go that on the books, so i couldn t weasel out of it  now this was also a way, because i set the start times as 10 a m , which seems late   i know jayco s already done 18 hours of calisthenics by then   but in my case it forced me to get up at 8 30 or 9 00, which for me was like a herculean task ''it sounds ridiculous, but i very often go to bed at 3 00 or 4 00 in the morning  so to reverse that trend, i prepaid and prescheduled for 10 00 in the morning  then there s a bunch of weird stuff that i wrote down here in terms of experiments  now the experiments were in answer to the question  what are the most absurd things i could do? what are the craziest things i could do? so for 2017, what are the craziest thing is could do? i actually have not done this exercise yet  i m going to do it within the next few days  i m recording this on the 27th of december ''last year, i wrote down a bunch of whacky ones  short film competition, for like an action movie sequence, question mark  impersonation, question mark  that might require a bunch of explanation  i won t get into it right now  the next one, and this requires even more explanation, but i think you guys will get a kick out of it  the polygamist king, question mark?''i have not had enough alcohol to get into that right now  the next one, apparel diet, go one year without any new clothing, without purchasing any new clothing  i still think that one is a good one  and then sara silverman, that s not related to polygamist king, or the apparel diet, these are potential   this is not in the crazy land, but i tend to just let my hand flow, if thoughts are coming to mind  podcast guests, sara silverman, gerard carmichael, shay carl  shay carl ended up on the podcast ''okay, so we have a number of things that i ve talked about, and what is the craziest thing, what are the craziest things i could do? and some of you might recall, i ve written about this in tools of titans  the goal with answering that question is not to come up with good ideas  the goal is to come up with absurd, crazy ideas, and then you find the seeds of potential good ideas later, but you don t edit  first it s the idea generation phase, and this is what has helped me ''and i think i mentioned this on the james altucher podcast when he interviewed me  i came up with a list at the wired conference i attended  i think it was the wired conference  yeah, it was the wired conference, absolutely  i remember sitting in on these incredible sessions and at one point i was inspired to just try to think, not bigger, but odder, think stranger  if you re having trouble thinking bigger, just think stranger  it s kind of a shortcut, for me at least it has been ''i started making a list of all the craziest things i could do  and it was like give away all my money, like literally just give it away, not donate, just give it away  to shut down all my businesses  to sell the blog  i didn t even have the podcast  this was about two years ago when i came up with this  and then cut off both of my feet  what the fuck, right? i mean, that s just insane talk, but i wrote it down  i was like, alright, cut off both my feet  don t think i ll do that, but yeah, that would qualify as crazy  and i kept on going, and eventually one was take an indefinite startup vacation ''and that paved the way later to me taking this indefinite startup vacation, which has been one of the decisions of the last three years of my life, without question  now along with the, what are the craziest things i can do, i will ask another question, which is, it s effectively 10x, question mark? and the 10x can apply to many different things  what would i have to do, or what might i do, no matter how crazy, to 10x the listenership of the podcast? to 10x the multi unique visitors to the blog? to 10x the amount of revenues from a, b, c, d, or e? and this goes hand and hand very nicely with the seth godin question of, if i had to charge 2x and couldn t do any paid advertising, what would i do instead? these pair very, very nicely ''but trying to really focus on 10x versus 10 percent, because if you ve set up certain assumptions, and systems, and processes, that only allow incremental, or at least only foster incremental gains and thinking, to unlock yourself, free yourself from those, asking how to improve 20 percent instead of 10, is not going to provide you with a new framework, or a new process, or a new structure, a new business organization, whatever it might be, a new org chart  so the 10x i do find very, very, very helpful, as a way to again, come up with a lot of crazy ideas, and then pick and choose from the rubble, so to speak later, so that you can find the seeds of something that could be a good idea later  those are really the basics  i would encourage you to think of batching ''before we get to batching, number one, schedule the fun stuff first, because if there is a void, if you re a type a driven personality, and you don t schedule and defend the fun stuff, or the positive, the things that have produced, the 20 percent that have produced 80 percent or more of your positive emotions in the previous year, if you don t expand those and block out time, and then pre book, prepay, pre commit to other people, so there s a social accountability, work will fill the void that remains  and then you will end up realizing at the end of january oh my god, i ve over calendared, and i no longer have time for the fun stuff  and then you re fucked, so let s not do that  that s a terrible feeling and a terrible place to be ''those are really the basics of how i think about the year  i m not going to bore everybody by going through the 17 question that i go into at great length, both on the blog, and in tools of titans  so again, if you want to search 17 questions tim ferriss, you can find it there ''a few things that i m thinking about though, and i would love your feedback on  so the first is again, this live podcast tour idea  and i might combine it with like acro yoga play parties, not to be confused with other play parties, jam sessions is maybe a better way to put it, throughout the u s  i think it would be really fun to combine those two  not everybody who would attend would do the acro  those would be kind of like two separate activities  but that would again, provide me with the physical component, along with the intellectual stimulation and fun of doing these live podcasts  and the way i ll probably select cities will be by identifying facebook groups, so tools of titans group, fill in the blank, it doesn t matter  trenton, portland, maine ''it doesn t have to be one of the major cities  and if it gets up to a reasonable size, let s just say 250 or more people, then that might end up being a stop on the tour  that is probably how i will go about it  the second thing that i m thinking of doing that i would love to get your feedback on  and when i say i d love your feedback, just let me know on twitter, or on the blog post, in the blog post comments for this podcast  and you can find the show notes and everything for this at fourhourworkweek com podcast, or you can hit me on twitter  is more month long experiments? now, some of you may remember knob nam, which was no booze and no masturbation for 30 days , where we had i believe almost 10,000 people actually log in and participate in a sort of community accountability fashion on coach me, which was amazing ''and a lot of people got a tremendous amount of that  the next experiment i was thinking about doing, and if people would like to do more of this, let me know  but potentially in january doing a noc noc  it s so dumb that i find these things so amusing   noc noc  n o c, n o c no carbs, no complaining  so it would be effectively a slow carb diet, and there are some allowances for carbs on cheat day and so on  but no carbs, no complaining, it would be a month long version of the 21 day no complain challenge that i ve done before for myself  i ve never done it with a large group, and i think it would be even better  i think it would be easier, in fact, in some respects when you re doing it with a group knowing that thousands or tens of thousands of people are doing right alongside you  so no carbs, no complaining, noc noc  i was going to make it no caffeine, no complaining, or no coffee, no complaining, but that, i think if you lose the coffee, people start bitching pretty quickly so that may be asking too much, but no carbs, no complaining, and then maybe we get rid of the coffee or the caffeine  let me know what you think  and that is really about it, guys ''i ve had such a lovely 2016  i just have nothing but love for you guys  it s been incredible what this podcast has allowed me to do  it s been incredibly entertaining, educating, and life affirming to join you guys like this, and to interview people i find fascinating, and try to share them with you  it s really one of the most gratifying experiences that i get to have on a regular basis  so thank you for listening  i really appreciate it  and i wish you and yours nothing but the best for 2017  may you find much joy, deep wisdom, and many pleasant surprises  and i think i ll leave it at that  if you ve read tools of titans and you haven t left an amazon review, i would really, really appreciate that  you know where to find it ''otherwise, i would say think bigger, and if you re having trouble thinking bigger, think stranger  maybe you ll find something in that list that will end up being surprisingly practical to crack you out of perhaps self limiting beliefs, or stories, or narratives, that you ve held for this year, or perhaps even longer  i really look forward to seeing what all of you guys do in 2017  so thank you for listening, and until next time this is tim ferriss giving you a big virtual hug, and i ll talk to you soon '"
232,240,Accelerated Learning and Mentors – My Personal Story (#240),"'it took place at sxsw edu, with an audience of primarily educators and administrators  an unusual audience for me, but a very exciting audience  as some context, charles best, who i met in high school as wrestling partners of all things   we ll talk about that   but he has since done many things, including launching donorschoose org in 2000 at a bronx public high school where he taught history for five years ''now, flash forward to today  what are we looking at? donorschoose org is one of oprah winfrey s ultimate favorite things  it has been on the cover of fast company as one of the 50 most innovative companies in the world  the first time a charity has ever received such recognition  teachers are more than 70  of all the public schools in america have used donorschoose org to create classroom project requests  you should absolutely check this company out  it is lean  it is run as well as anything out there ''but the conversation itself focuses on topics that you can apply to your own lives in terms of learning things faster  it talks about teaching   good teaching, bad teaching, tough love, the value thereof, and many different things  i hope you enjoy this conversation as much as i did with the one and only, charles best ''charles best  all right  packed house  this is awesome  tim is an old and dear friend of mine  we went to high school together  we were on the wrestling team together  this is actually a fireside chat, not just a euphemism for an informal, warm conversation  i m just thrilled to be asking you some questions  we ve got a lot of teachers in the audience, so why don t we kick it off  let me ask you, tell us about a teacher or two who made a really big difference in your life  i ll start with just thanking everybody in the audience  you guys are doing really important work  thank you, guys  education has played a huge role in my life  there are no many different inflection points  i ll mention two who come to mind  the first is mrs  vinsky, who has sadly passed, but she was my first grade teacher in public school in long island  i had refused to learn the alphabet up to that point  i d been made to eat soap as a result, which i don t recommend  i wouldn t survive first grade is what my mother had been told ''mrs  vinsky took me aside and she said,  tim, if you learn the alphabet, you ll be able to read any book you want  and if you can read books, you can learn anything that you want   i was like,  why didn t anybody tell me?  on top of that, she discovered something, which was that competition really motivates me  she had a long, paper line up on the wall  it went the entire length of the classroom  each student had a racecar and based on the number of books you read and completed, that racecar moved towards the finish line  for whatever reason, that is really what drove me to consume as many books as possible  so mrs  vinsky, no  1 ''then flashing forward, a familiar name for both of us, would be john buxton  it s very strange for me to say his first name because i would never dare  mr  b, mr  buxton was our wrestling coach, but he was also a teacher  he was also involved with the administration and i believe the endowment ''he provided a very unique form of tough love in the wrestling room that was extremely critical to me, i think, in that sort of 10th grade, 11th grade period in particular  looking back, i think almost everyone on that team has done some really amazing things  they all look back and would mention mr  buxton  i would say those two immediately come to mind ''charles best  totally  mr  buxton is the teacher who made me want to be a teacher  if not for mr  buxton, i think there would be no donorschoose org  well, when you were on oprah, you brought up mr  buxton ''charles best  that s right  he was one of the seminal, sort of pivotal figures in your life ''charles best  yeah, actually, i remember thinking if anyone ever looked up to me the way that i looked up to mr  buxton, i would ve done my share and knew i wanted to be a teacher  we re going to be talking about accelerated learning and your insights for learning more quickly and more deeply  let s start with just your framework for how someone can learn more quickly and more deeply  the general framework that i used was really pieced together over many years via trial and error  i think there s some applications in the classroom, certainly that i can pull from my personal experience  the general acronym is dsss  you leave the i out  you ll get there, don t worry  so a d and then three ss  that s the framework  it refers to, step 1, deconstruction  the order is very important  deconstruction is really taking a skill, learn a language, learn to swim, whatever it might be, and break it into the smallest lego pieces possible ''for instance, i didn t learn to swim until i was in my 30s  this is very embarrassing for someone who grew up on long island  granted, rat tail, fine, whatever  we can talk about that later  i was deathly afraid of the water  i had some near drowning incidents  i tried to take courses and take lessons  none of it worked until i was introduced to something called total immersion ''what total immersion did for me that no other method did, for me at least, was break down the constituent pieces  so it wouldn t put me in the water to say get on a kickboard right away because there are a bunch of issues with that  let s separate breathing  let s separate proper body position for hydrodynamics  then you take out kicking, so that s a separate piece  then upper body movements  then you order them in the least threatening way  so breathing isn t even a piece of it for the first day or two  you would just focus on standing in a 4 foot deep pool and kicking off the side and practicing your streamline position ''deconstruction is step no  1  the next is selection  selection, in effect, you re using the 80 20 principles like pareto s law, to answer the question, what 20  of those lego blocks deliver 80  of the results or more than i m looking for?''there are certain places where this is really profound  in language learning, for instance  i thought i was bad at language learning up until the point that i transferred to the school where we met, st  paul s  that s a whole separate story  i had the chance to study with mr  shimano in japanese  i figured well, if i m going to be terrible at spanish, i might as well be terrible at a different language where my friends are actually in the class  in any language, you can take 2,000 words and be functionally conversationally fluent  you can identify the highest frequency words ''you could also take even something as complex as learning to read and write japanese and narrow it down to the common use characters, which is around 1,900 something, i believe  then from there, say let s break it down even further  almost all of those characters are formed by 100 to 120 radicals  that s what you would focus on ''the 20 percent deliver 80 percent of the results that i m looking for  next you have sequencing  sequencing i think is the most neglected perhaps  what is a logical progression in which to lay out the lego blocks that i ve selected those 20 percent  you can figure out that if you ask, for instance, what if we did the opposite for 48 hours, just as a testing approach, that you can unearth some real gems  when i learned for instance, to dance tango in argentina, partially because i was forced to  i had a female teacher who was very high level  i learned the female role, the follow, before i learned the lead ''it ended up being a key reason why i was able to compete in the world championships six months later  because i learned the female role first, which is very odd  also, if you talk to a friend of mine, josh waitzkin, who was the basis for searching for bobby fischer (he is the kid), when he learned to play chess when he had his first real coach, they took all the pieces off the board ''they didn t start with openings, which everyone does  you memorize basically the answers in the teacher s book and you just learn all these openers  instead of that, his teacher took all of the pieces off the board and put a king versus king and pawn  he reduced the complexity to focus on principles  really flexible principles instead of tactics that were memorized  the sequencing is very critical ''the last piece you would like is very self evident, but it s often not, and that s stakes  not steaks like flipping on a barbecue, but consequences  how do you build in incentives and motivation, whether that s a reward or a punishment or both, so that you or other people will actually do what the plan includes? that could be the racecars ''that could be the stakes  that could be an incentive  you could also take any number of different approaches  there are tools like stikk com   s t i k k, and others that you can use to harness loss aversion to your advantage  for instance, if you want to lose weight, and there s another one called diet bet   this is something a lot of people have done successfully   you could take  100 or whatever amount is going to be painful for you to lose, put it into stikk  it goes into escrow and if you don t hit your goals and other people verify this, then that gets contributed to your anti charity ''so an anti charity is a nonprofit that you would rather nuke than give money to  so it could be the american nazi party  it could be whatever it might be  you ll be on the public record as having donated if you don t lose your 20 pounds in two months  so believe me, my friend derek sivers, who is an entrepreneur said,  if more information were the answer, we d all be billionaires with perfect abs  ''you just need incentives  that s the basic framework  you can get into the nuances and details, but that basic framework has helped me with all of the skills that i ve tackled, i d say in the last decade, certainly ''charles best  speaking of the skills that you ve tackled, let s see how this framework works in action  tell us about a particular skill that you ve attained in an especially unorthodox way  let s see  i m trying to omit the odd ones like japanese horseback archery  turns out not a long career, particularly in the u s , if it s something you focus on  i ll come back to i think the swimming  because it had all of the ingredients for something that i would fail and did fail at for a very long time  the fear factor was very high  the shame factor was very high ''the unorthodox approach that i took   well, just to give you, actually, back into it  what are the results? the results were i didn t swim  i couldn t do two laps in a small pool until my early 30s  ten days later, after getting a book   i didn t even have video at this point, with total immersion i was doing 20 to 40 laps per workout to relax  this is ten days later  i ve had many friends duplicate this  many of my readers and listeners and so on ''unorthodox for me because in retrospect it seems so obvious, yet if you go into any pool and have the general staff teach you, they re going to teach you very differently  in this particular approach, (a) remove as may failure points and fear areas as possible for the very beginning ''you want people to get as much positive reinforcement early on as possible  in this case, i was in a 4 foot deep pool, kicking off the side  i realized wow, even without any strokes, without any kicking, i can cover a third of the pool distance if i just get my body in the right position  second, questioning assumptions  this is something that terry, the founder of total immersion, does very well, is that i d always tried to swim on top of the water  well, a body is dense  it tends to sink  so assume that your body s going to be 90 95 percent underwater ''you actually think of it conceptually as swimming downhill  isn t that odd? by swimming downhill, your arm is actually angled down underneath the water by 3 feet  the pressure on that arm helps to tilt your legs up and makes you more hydrodynamic  you figure this all out by kicking off the wall and then standing up  kick off the wall, stand up ''secondly is finding the exercise   this can be applied to any domain   what is the one exercise that makes all of the other exercises irrelevant or less important? this is part of the sequencing  what i realized in my own experimentation with it is that a hand swapping drill in swimming, where you re basically trying to have your arm enter the water at the same time that your other arm is straight and then replace it, extends the period during which you re in your extended fuselage position  if i just focused on that one exercise, hand swapping drill, everything else fell into place ''that was going from zero to shortly thereafter   because this was   we re going to come back to incentives   about eight months before a friend and i had assigned each other new year s resolutions  by the way, more effective than coming up with your own ''my friend was just completely addicted to double espressos and had like 12 a day  i was like,  okay, yours is nothing stronger than green tea for a year   he s like,  okay   he did it  now granted, he would pack like 12 days worth of green tea into a french press   i don t know why i feel so sick   i m like,  i think i see your problem   but he stuck with it  his assignment to me after seeing me flail around in the water and get out at one point, he said,  you need this as a life skill for yourself, for your kids  you have to do a one kilometer open water, meaning an ocean or lake, swim by the end of the year  ''i got to july, august, had failed effectively every class that i had taken and abandoned it until total immersion  then i would say two weeks after starting, i ended up doing a one mile, not one kilometer, open water swim by myself in the ocean where i grew up, at the specific beach where i had one of my near drowning experiences ''that would be an example  it s an important example because it was a skill that i was deathly afraid of  i think a lot of students end up in that position for many different reasons ''charles best  wow  i feel like helping someone get over a near drowning experience is something that may not be totally safe for teachers to do with their students  i want to ask you, of all the experimentation and adventuring that you ve done from ice baths or archery on horseback, to you name it, which of those activities can kids try themselves? which of the experiments you ve done, the adventures you ve had, can a teacher assign to their students or help their students undertake?''tim ferriss  i ll leave out the ten day fasts and the muscle biopsies, also probably not great for insurance policies at schools  i would suggest a competition of some type ''the one that comes to mind for me is how many foreign vocabulary words   forget about grammar, forget about all that, but how many vocab words can you memorize in a day? have a reward  have an inspiring reward  it doesn t take much  i recall at one point   keep in mind, the kid who was bad at languages, who had done very poorly in spanish, until i had mr  shimano, who was incredible, and the right environment ''after that point, i ve often played this game with myself where i d take italian   and became obsessed with pneumonic devices, so memory tricks like say the memory palace, which was used by cicero, or the link word pneumonic  there s a gentleman i believe by the last name of gr nberg, who wrote a number of books that highlight how to use word association and image association, i should say, to memorize foreign vocabulary ''let s say you have spanish vaca, right? v a c a, vaca  how would you learn, if you re a native english speaker, vaca? this is where i think you can engage a lot of kids  imagine a cow with a vacuum head vacuuming up head  all right? cow, vacuum head, vacuuming up grass  think about it  do that for ten seconds, and you could probably teach a class where you do that at the beginning of class, come back 30 minutes later,  what s the word for cow in spanish?  they will remember it  they might remember it a week later, just from that 15 seconds ''so you play this game of imagery and creating these associations  i kid you not, you will probably   if you had a classroom of 50 students, it depends on age, but you could very well have students who successfully remember a week later 200 to 300 vocabulary items, from a single day  that would not surprise me all  keep in mind the minimum effective dose, if you want to be considerate or perceived as conversationally fluent, is probably around 2,000 words ''how many of us have heard  it takes a lifetime to learn a language?  i certainly was told that  i was like,  lifetime? screw that  i have things i want to do  i don t want to commit to a lifetime of studying something just to be good at it  that s so depressing and demoralizing   but instead, if i said, you just did 200 words in a day, two days, if you did that times 10, what is that, two weeks? you would have all the raw materials to be considered conversationally fluent in a language  how encouraging is that? how exciting is that?''to position a language, a second lens through which you can experience life, you re effectively doubling your lifespan, okay? wow  you use all of the tricks and tips that i m sure many of these people are familiar with  but context  maybe some kids are into hip hop  maybe some kids are into comic books and manga, like i was when i was in japan ''utilize all of that  i think that would be an experiment that i would run because it s so easy to apply that dis framework to it  the implications for each of those stages are so easily mapped to just a foreign vocabulary memorization competition, using pneumonic devices  there are a lot of macro principles embedded in this one micro exercise, if that makes sense  you re learning the macro from the micro  the student doesn t have to know any of this  this is just a trojan horse  you re slipping it in there  just like josh waitzkin and his teacher taking the pieces off the board ''charles best  you arrive at some many of these tactics and breakthroughs, like pneumonic devices, by way of experimentation, where you re often running an a b test and doing more of what works, doing less of what doesn t work, always, always a b testing  has there ever been a time when you decided you needed to forget about the data, not run an a b test and just go on gut because you believed something in your heart and it felt inappropriate to run an a b test?''tim ferriss  it s very rare, i ll be honest  but the question allows me to maybe chat a little bit about how i think about the use of intuition  i m trying to increasingly use intuition  intuition helps me to identify things that i would like to test, even if they seem ridiculous  for instance, every time i ve had a roommate in a foreign country where i m using comic books to learn a language, i get ridiculed  every single time  they re like wham, pow, smash, really? then three months later, they re a convert because they see i m studying dialogue  that s why the comic books work  the same reason that scripts, if you can get translated scripts for movies, which you can very easily, works so well for language learning ''charles best  wow  and i use intuition  ''charles best  scripts from foreign films that you can then read while you re watching the movie?''tim ferriss  or a script from a movie that you know really well, whether that s die hard, babe, whatever, which are two real examples for me  if you know those    as for the renegade duck,  anyway  that s from babe, not die hard  you could also look at   for instance, i would actually encourage people to take movies they know really well  i m getting off track ''charles best  it s a great technique, i wanted you to draw it out  where you have subtitles available in your target language because if you do the inverse, if you don t catch a word orally, you re not going to be able to look it up or write it down  i tend to use the opposite  the point being, intuition is oftentimes just a proxy for interest  so if i m really interested in something, that checks the box partially of the stakes and incentives ''i use intuition in that case  i will very often, for instance, use my intuition   even if i split test  i ve done this a lot, say for book covers  even book titles  i tested the 4 hour workweek alongside 12 other titles and subtitles in google ad words  it was just the ad headline and the ad text  then i looked at the max click through, which one had the best click through a week later   it costs a few hundred dollars   and i knew exactly which title and subtitle would perform the best  that s how i came up with the title ''however, when i looked at the top three results for the book title, i had to ask myself, which of these can i live with? which of these will i be happy with? because once this genie s out of the bottle, i have to live with this forever  so for better or worse, i m the 4 hour guy for the rest of my life  but i knew i could live with the title  so i have vetoed best performing outcomes when i split test ''if i feel strongly that i m more interested in or will sleep more soundly with no  2 or no  3 ''charles best  i ve been listening to your podcast of late  especially getting ready for this conversation, but even before that  you have these incredible interviewees, both bold faced names and people that i d never heard about before who ve proved to be fascinating  of all the incredible people that you ve interviewed, whom would you nominate to design the ideal school?''tim ferriss  okay, i m going to answer that  the first recommendation i want to make, just to backtrack for a second, everyone should read a book called bad science by ben goldacre  on the subject of data and split testing and statistics  most science, and it could be split testing, that is represented in media is misreported ''it s extremely critical, it has never been more critical, i would say, to be scientifically literate  bad science covers how to become a more intelligent and astute reader of science and results so you can be very strategically and importantly literate in that sense  i would read that, which would inform, in fact, how you design a school  a lot of it   i think tracking is very important  i think experimentation is very important  when it comes to mastery, no one in my mind pops up more often that josh waitzkin  josh waitzkin has a foundation  he has taken his learning framework for chess   he s considered a prodigy, but i think it s a misnomer because  ''charles best  can you give a two second bio on josh waitzkin?''tim ferriss  josh is the little kid in the oshkosh overalls who ends up playing speed chess and dominating against the hustlers in washington square park in searching for bobby fischer ''there are some god given talents certainly in josh  he then went on to compete very successfully  there was a book and a movie based on his life  he has since taken his ability to deconstruct something like chess, applied it to tai chi push hands to become a world champion  he applied it to brazilian jiu jitsu to become the first blackbelt under marcelo garcia, who is considered the g o a t, the greatest of all time  he s like the mike tyson, wayne gretzsky, micky mantle combined in the world of grappling ''you could look at something called mg in action and you might think this would never apply to anything else  mg is marcelo garcia in action  he s taken different starting positions, transitions, and finishing positions and created effectively a database where you can look up any possible combination to learn more effectively ''josh has thought very deeply about the importance of single tasking focus and also skills that enable you to learn other skills  in other words, that lead domino that we discussed a little bit earlier  which of these will make everything else easier or irrelevant or less important? and sequencing things in the right fashion  i d say josh waitzkin ''charles best  so imagine you re hired as a teacher at josh waitzkin s school  what subject do you teach?''tim ferriss  i would teach   what would i teach? either   and i would call it something sexier   meta learning  how do you learn to learn? this is not something that s very often explicitly taught  i d cover the tool kid that you can apply to all of your other classes  let s practice that ''charles best  what is a lesson you d teach on one particular day as the teacher of meta learning at josh waitzkin s ideal school?''tim ferriss  well, the first class, and it depends a lot on grade level, but i think the first class would just be all demos  what will get the attention of these kids and hold their attention so that i am credible, but also maybe aspirational in some sense  which mr  buxton was, right? i mean, mr  buxton could kick your ass  he was a tough man  he could still go into the weight room and demolish the students  there was an incredible amount of respect, awe, aspiration  there are a lot of magic ingredients that are not so magic  you can tease them out and deconstruct them ''so i think the first class would really be all demos  let s so go around the room, memorize kids  names  have them go out, come back in, sit in different seats, remember all their names, right?''maybe have them shout out random numbers, memorize a string of say 50 digits like that and turn around and give it to them  and you d give it to them backwards on purpose  they re like no, you re wrong  no, no, keep going  and they re like, what? so first class would just be demo, credibility, this is somebody who s second class you want to come to  then i think, right away, i would take somebody in the class who doesn t   who in this class thinks they can t do this? a bunch of arms go up and i d pick one kid who looks the most fearful and they convert them right in front of the class  boom  just like that  i d make them a hero in the class, briefly  and then shoot them down!''charles best  and then crush their spirit!''tim ferriss  no, no  who do you think you are??? no, i would not do that ''charles best  that s where the soap comes in  yeah, bad table  that groundwork is so important  you need the patient to be willing to take the medicine  that would be step 1 ''charles best  i want to be in that class myself as a teenager  you were talking about mr  buxton and his ability to hold a room and the awe that we had for him  of those people you ve interviewed on your podcast, if josh waitzkin could design the ideal school, which of your podcast interviewees would be the virtuoso classroom teacher? which of your interviewees do you imagine just holding a room of 25 rambunctious 10th graders and how come?''tim ferriss  rambunctious 10th graders  okay  yeah 10th graders is tough ''charles best  i mean, jamie foxx probably would just by virtue of being jamie foxx  10th grade, the first person that comes to mind, and i want to give a couple of other answers, jocko willink, retired navy seal commander ''charles best  yeah  you want to be tougher? be tougher  and he s 230 pounds and a brazilian jiu jitsu blackbelt  everyone s going to behave  but it ll be at attention  so i think jocko would definitely, in terms of getting kids to behave, he ll get 100 percent on his test  i ll give two others real quick  maria popova, who runs brain pickings, is a phenom  he is very good in a world of listicles, where everyone s trying to out buzzfeed buzzfeed and buzzfeed s great at what they do  i don t think you should compete against them  she can make potentially dense literature very popular, and philosophy very popular  she is a long form writer ''she does not compromise  she does not dumb her material down  and yet, she built a private newsletter that went out to five of her friends up to now probably more than 10 million people a month  that s really impressive to me  she s also better at writing in english, in which is her second language, than i am  which involves some shame on my part  but last i would say, and i really encourage everyone to check this guy out, bj miller ''bj miller is a palliative care physician  he s a young guy  he s helped more than 1,000 people to die  he also suffered a horrible electrocution accident in college   actually at princeton where i went undergrad  he was a warning to all of us coming in to princeton  he lost three of his limbs  he s a triple amputee  i think his perspective on life and fulfillment and achievement and the balance thereof is incredible ''he has this uncanny ability to sit down and just immediately look into someone s soul and their wants and desires and fears and read it  i ve really never encountered anything quite like it  i think bj would be a lifechanging teacher ''charles best  i want to switch gears just for a second, recognizing that any number of people in the room are ed tech entrepreneurs  how has technology accelerated and enriched the pursuit of learning? how has technology hindered the pursuit of learning?''tim ferriss  i think, as with any technology, whether it s an app on an iphone or a stick that a chimp is using to fish out ants, in an ideal case, it s a tool that helps you to solve some type of prevalent problem ''technology makes a wonderful tool  it makes a terrible master  i think that anytime technology ends up in the driver seat in determining your behavior, there are a lot of risks and a lot of problems  how does it help? there is a lot that can be automated, whether it s machine learning or some form of deep learning  there are many ways technology can aid the learning process ''i was one of the first investors in a company called duolingo, which now has 100 million users  it s the largest free language learning platform in the world  they have a lot more coming  it s incredibly powerful  it was the byproduct of a number of founders, but one of those founders, luis von ahn, from guatemala originally, created captchas and recaptchas ''so if you ever have to type in a bunch of weird characters to prove you re not a robot on a website, you have him to thank for it  he used that  you might have noticed back in the day there were two fields  you d fill one in  the program knew the answer to that, that s how it would confirm you weren t a robot  the second was taken from books that machines couldn t transcribe accurately  so he was harnessing millions and millions and millions of people to transcribe books effectively so that the blind could use them, so that anyone could search them, etc  he s applied that to language learning in some really fascinating ways  there are many examples like that ''in terms of hindering, i would say that we live in a digital world where the economics of many of these businesses are dependent on distracting you as much as possible ''so if you go on facebook and you just need to check a direct message from a friend to figure out what i m going to be doing on tuesday and then two hours later, you re like, why am i watching an orangutan video? what happened? did i just time travel? the business models are predicated on being able to distract you effectively  they are very good at it  they re putting billions of dollars, probably collectively trillions of dollars into discovering new and better ways to distract you off of your chosen task  i think that technology can be exceptionally damaging, not just as it relates to learning, but i m sure in a bunch of cognitive capacities ''actually, the distracted mind, written by a friend of mine, adam gazzaley, who is a neuroscience ph d  and runs at lab at ucsf, is worth checking out to see some of the consequences of that  but i d say broadly speaking, distraction ''conversely, if you can teach yourself and your students to single task, not multitask, to single task more effectively, that ability which used to be par for the course, is becoming a super power  if you can establish ways of blocking out distraction rich technology for even short periods of time, you have a huge competitive advantage ''charles best  let s go back a couple thousand years when distraction rich technology was just a non issue  this is a question i m just thinking of right now  could you give us a one minute primer on stoic philosophy? and then riff on how you think stoic philosophy could or should inform our public school system?''tim ferriss  i m really glad you brought this up because stoicism i think is one of the best operating systems for thriving in high stress environments ''you want to prepare yourself and students for that  i was going to say   why i hesitated when i brought up the meta learning class   was the other option would ve been stoicism  but it would ve been a class about   and i can t call it planned suffering   but in effect, the more you schedule and practice suffering, the less that unplanned suffering will disrupt your life ''stoicism, if we go back to seneca, marcus aurelius, is really very similar to zen in many ways  it is a practical set of beliefs, frameworks and exercises that allow you to inoculate yourself against fear of the unknown, fear of worst case scenarios, to become less emotionally reactive  which is why stoicism, and certainly you can look at george washington, thomas jefferson had seneca on his bedside table ''i think bill clinton reads meditations by marcus aurelius every year  but if you want to look at some additional contemporary examples, it s become hugely popular in the silicon valley  it s become hugely popular in the nfl, including the winners of the past two super bowls, because it teaches you how to view obstacles as opportunities and how to become less emotionally reactive  you re effectively putting the serenity prayer into practice ''where you are learning to separate the things you can control from the things you cannot control and to only focus on the former  and to develop the courage and the ability to act  what might that look like in a classroom? well, i was chatting with phil zimbardo  the episode hasn t come out yet for the podcast  phil zimbardo is professor emeritus at stanford, where he designed the stanford prison experiment, which people might be familiar with ''he s very good at explaining how good people can be turned evil and vice versa, how you can determine how people will behave based on conditions  he has an exercise he calls, for instance, deviant for a day  hold on  i know this is family programming  i m getting to the point  he puts a black square, using an erasable marker, not a sharpie, on his forehead and encourages students to do this and walk around for a day  despite the ridicule, despite people trying to rub it off, to wear this black mark on your forehead for a day and to see how much social pressure affects your emotional responses ''there are other ways that you could implement this  cato, who was considered the perfect stoic by seneca, would wear a tunic of an odd color so that he would deliberately get ridiculed by others ''he would learn to be ashamed of only those things worth being ashamed of  right now, i think in the hypersensitive, politically correct environment in which we live, the only way serious problems are going to be solved is if we have very uncomfortable conversations  right now, people are too afraid of being labeled, called out, whatever it might be, ostracized, to have those uncomfortable conversations  you can train yourself to be more comfortable with discomfort by planning it  i have these pants i call my party pants  they re hideous  they look like the upholstery from my grandmother s couch ''i ll wear them around in environments where i know i m going to get heckled  there are many such exercises that you can make fun  you can do comfort challenges where it s like okay, student x, we re going to go to the gym because that s our next segue  i want you to go in and we re not going to mention anything  you re just going to lay down on the floor around all these other students for ten seconds ''you re not going to explain what you re doing  you re just going to lay down on the floor, to show them that you re going to be nervous, you re going to be afraid, and then nothing is going to happen  to really teach people how to pick apart and analyze their fears effectively  you could organize an entire curriculum around that  full of exercises that are fun, that will make your students more resilient and willing to take risks  when you teach them to define it the way i would define it, which is the likelihood of an irreversible negative outcome, most things just aren t that risky at all ''i think that if you want to embolden them and encourage them to really be change makers, put a positive dent in the world, to become entrepreneurs, teachers or otherwise, that s a toolkit that they can take with them for the rest of their lives ''charles best  if you d worn those party pants today, you could ve had 3,000 people heckling you all at once  that s true  on the internet, and then it would get rebroadcast  it would ve been great practice ''charles best  speaking of people heckling you, i want to turn to audience questions  before we do that, you ve been an incredible advocate of donorschoose org for just about a decade now  why have you been so good to our effort?''tim ferriss  there are a few very specific reasons  i m not involved with many nonprofits  i apply the same filters to nonprofits as i do to for profits  i ve been very fortunate in silicon valley to work with, as an advisor or investor, a lot of the fastest growing companies in the world  i ve been an early investor in facebook, twitter, alibaba  i was pre seed advisor to uber  i support donorschoose because (a) you run it like a lean for profit  i think the criteria should be the same  (b) it s the specificity and accountability  i don t like contributing or donating to causes that are nebulous ''in this case, i recognize that education and certain teachers and opportunities played a huge role in my life  i wouldn t be here if it weren t for half a dozen people i could name off the top of my head  if i can level the playing field in very specific ways   for instance, i want to find projects where schools and teachers can t afford say headgear and wrestling mats for wrestling programs  check  i can do that in very specific areas  i want to find projects where students are taking science projects home  you re encouraging students to work on hands on projects in science on their own ''that s very important  i can get really granular  you know this  but i ve done flash funding for long island or new hampshire or some areas in the bay area where i live now  the fact that you can target so specifically and then get feedback and look at the results so specifically, as someone who tracks everything, i just find that incredible attractive ''that applies to whether you have  10 00 to apply to a single teacher in your hometown where you grew up, or  1 million or  10 million to deploy more widely to really change the entire national conversation and results you see from certain types of classrooms  it s a good startup ''charles best  thank you  i m betting on you guys  don t screw it up ''charles best  thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you  would you take some questions that have been upvoted?''tim ferriss  i will  i m looking at some upvoted questions here, as well as here  we have redundancy in case my eyes go sideways  i think good enough vision to look right here  the first question from  anonymous    oh, my favorite   is  what is the no  1 skill you think our students need to learn today that we don t teach them enough?  i would say it probably   above and beyond the meta learning   is comfort with discomfort ''i think that our kids, our students are too infantilized  going back to mr  buxton, mr  buxton was very supportive, but he was supportive at the right times and in the right way  if you got a good job, that was a nice  inaudible   for mr  buxton, that was an event  he didn t dole it out all the time so that you became numb to it  he was very tough  he forced you to do things you thought you could not do  i remember one time   hopefully he s okay with me sharing this   but we were doing these horrible exercises  i think they were called blood pits  they had some terrible nickname ''it was where we did these rotations in a small group  you received zero rest  i remember telling mr  buxton, i walked over and said,  mr  buxton, i think i m going to vomit   he goes,  no problem  bucket s right there  go vomit and come back because you re up next  ''i was like,  oh, my god  please save me   lo and behold, i came out of that practice and i had done two to three times of what i thought i was capable of doing  that type of toughness i think is important in training that toughness  an ability to be resilient in the face of criticism and ridicule is a prerequisite if you want people to then use what you would give them in the meta learning  does that make sense? helping kids to become more comfortable with discomfort and dissect their own fears and overcome them, which you can sometimes demonstrate very quickly in the cases of language learning, and you can then give them the meta learning, i think would be my approach ''next question    what things do you think a person cannot or should not learn rapidly?  nothing comes to mind  i just haven t run into anything  with any given skill, even if it takes 10 years or 20 years, i think everyone can agree there is a dumber way to go about doing it and there s a smarter way of going about doing it ''there s a spectrum  you want to be on the supportive side, which is going to be faster  next one is from jeremy shore,  what sub  100 purchase has most changed your life in the past six months?  well, this is the first that comes to life  i would say it is a marpac dome white noise machine that i have in multiple locations because it s so important to me  this is to help with sleep  it is effective  it sounds like a fan inside a small device that is very useful for sleep  i think sleep is a force multiplier for many other things ''charles best  you know what, actually, just on the prior question, because i actually didn t catch al framework  i don t know what that stands for either  but to the question about how some of the tools you ve developed and systems of thinking you ve developed can be used to address inequity in our public schools  sure  i ll apologize to everyone in advance that you all probably know a lot more about that environment than i do  i m not an expert in any school administration or curriculum  i ll take a stab at it  i think that if i were in charge of it, let s make it micro because i think you can learn a lot from case studies  if you gave me a classroom of minorities or people who are considered to be victims of that inequity, whether it s female students, learning disabled students, you name it  i would give them the tools to perform  in the sense that i think you need to arm people with tools and training so that they believe in themselves and that they can demonstrate beyond a shadow of a doubt that they can compete ''there are many other inequities and problems that are not addressed by that  there are plenty of systemic issues  i would have to try to tackle this one at a time  but i would say, in general, whether it s for instance, in another nonprofit that i m involved with, questbridge, is very good at this  i think they place something like half of the lowest income kids   which, by the way, includes poor white kids in appalachia and so on  it s not race specific  but people at an economic disadvantage into ivy league schools  they placed about half last year ''they do that by, in part, making talented kids who are driven but who are at a severe disadvantage economically, or in a social situation where they re not even encouraged to apply to college, but could get a free ride to harvard, to go to different programs that will enable them and give them these tools and give them the belief system that will allow them to make those choices ''that s my best attempt  i apologize if that is a dissatisfying answer   as teachers, we talk about the difference between memorizing and really learning, internalizing  when does that transition happen for you in your framework?  i think whenever we get into conversations, whether it s about super sensitive topics, like inequity, we didn t have time to get into it  but if we were having a bunch of wine and talking about this more, i would ask a lot of questions before trying to answer that question  what are we talking about exactly? where did it start? what are the ramifications? what are some examples?''i will say that really learning means you have a firm grasp of principles that allow you to adapt to different environments, including high stress environments  to me, that would mean you are an adept learner in x  languages are a great case study for this, but i don t want to belabor the language learning because even teachers  eyes tend to glaze over if we re talking about language learning too long ''but i should also highlight, when does that transition happen? the transition happens, i think you really start learning, very often, or you become an adept learner, again to use definitions really clearly, when you get to a more intermediate level  you can t get to intermediate level until you have a critical mass of the raw materials and building blocks so that you can start to create in novel combinations  whether that s swimming, whether that s brazilian jiu jitsu, whether that s experimentation in the sciences or anything else ''i would say don t dismiss memorizing per se  i think that memorizing is actually really important because you do need to consolidate the memories and practice of these building blocks, 20 percent that gets you the 80 percent, the 1,000 most important words, before you can get fancy and improvise and become an adept learner ''i would say you re learning, meaning you re absorbing from the very get go  from minute 1 of day 1 of the framework that i laid out  but you don t become an adept learner in the adaptable sense until you start getting into more of an entertainment phase, which does not mean two years later  that could be two weeks later for a lot of skills  it could be two hours later  it just depends on the subject matter  this is a great one   how do you recommend teachers address students who struggle with competition tasks due to anxiety or learning disabilities? ''this is a really important question  just in my personal opinion   by the way   i don t view myself as a writer or a podcaster or an investor  i view myself first and foremost as a teacher  i m not the best writer  i don t think i m tolstoy  i think we could probably all agree on that ''i do, however, write all of my books to make the complex simple  so i think about it as a teacher  the way that i ve experienced tackling this question   how do you address students, including by readers, listeners and so on, who struggle with competition tasks due to anxiety or learning disabilities? i ve dealt with thousands and tens of thousands of people who ve fallen in both categories  the way that you deal with that is not be protecting them from competition tasks  the way that you address that is by dosing them, starting off very lightly and titrating up with larger and more intimidating tasks to make it less scary  i m going to keep it at that ''i think a lot of it is just operant and classical conditioning  teaching myself how to change my own behavior, looking at bj fogg out of stanford, ultimately it all comes back to a lot of this stuff ''i do think that you can learn a lot about training yourself  i learned a lot about changing my own behavior when i was training molly, my puppy, reading a book called don t shoot the dog  it s fantastic, by the way  it s really good  i would say that you need to dose people who are afraid of something with that something, just like iocane powder in the princess bride, if you guys get that reference  then titrate up from there  that is how you help people with that  in the same way that something like toastmasters helps you get over fear of stage fright  you don t help someone with that by having them think their way out of it  it doesn t work ''you get them on stage day 1  if you want to do standup comedy, i ve asked a number of professional comedians on my podcast, because that is my biggest fear in the world is getting on stage and trying to make people laugh  forget about it  i asked them a question i ask many people, which is, if you had a million dollars on the line, you have eight weeks to prepare me for standup comedy ''i have to have ten minutes of material  what would the curriculum look like in the first week? they said, day 1 i have you on stage, i don t even care what your material is  you re not going to have any  i just want you to get comfortable on stage because it s going to terrify you  they re like, 90 percent of it is just getting comfortable on stage  the whole world is a stage, so you need to get students comfortable with it ''charles best  i m going to jump in with a final question  then we ll give folks back, maybe at least one minute on their day  what legacy do you hope to leave in the field of education and learning?''tim ferriss  i really think about two things  one is i m trying to create a benevolent army of learners who have an incredibly good toolkit that they can then impart to more people  a large group, millions of people, who are in effect, enabled super learners ''not because they have any innate talent for it, but because they have a better toolkit who can then impart that and spread it and hand it on to other people  i would say, if we re talking about an inscription on a gravestone, it would be  a teacher who wanted his students to always be better than he was  ''charles best  that s it  well, if ever there was a benevolent army of learners, i think it s the community assembled right here  i know i speak for tim and myself in thanking each of you for the time you ve spared to listen  on behalf of this benevolent army of learners, i want to thank you, tim, for your insights and your tools and tricks  thank you so much  thank you guys '"
